### Lesson Three

Translated from the German by Frank Thomas Smith\
Dornach, February 29, 1924

Let us begin, my dear friends, with the words the Guardian speaks
-- words we already know -- when pointing in the direction of the
spiritual world, which characterize what the human being can feel
on the threshold of the spiritual world as he strides past the
Guardian.

> > From the wide expanse of beings in space\
> > Who experience existence in light,\
> > From the tread of time\'s onward course\
> > Which finds in creating its very activity;\
> > From the depths of the feeling heart\
> > Where in the Self the world is founded:\
> > \
> > There resounds in the soul\'s utterance,\
> > There shines from the spirit\'s thoughts,\
> > Which from divine healing forces\
> > in the cosmic-creative forces\
> > Weave the mighty existential words:\
> > O Man, know thyself!

\

It\'s about the path one should follow in thought, the path which
one will actually take when seeking access to the spiritual world.
And we should not say that when someone experiences in thought --
if he honestly and earnestly lives in his thoughts -- what the
person in process of initiation realizes in reality by entering
the spiritual world, that the former does not actually participate
in what is revealed to the human soul when entering the spiritual
world, because it is only a reflected
ideation.

One should not say: Let\'s leave gaining entrance into the
spiritual world to those who are striving to be initiates and
stand with their souls in the spiritual world as people stand in
physical existence with their senses. Rather should one say: When
even in thought one approaches the description of the path that
leads to the spiritual world, and provided the thinking is not
superficial, he will experience and feel fully what it means to
leave the world of the senses behind, a world only the intellect
can grasp, and enter the spiritual
world.

That is what I will speak to you about today, my dear friends,
and not merely for those who already seek the transformation which
will lead them into the spiritual world, but also for those who,
at first, only experience the transformation in their thoughts.
And that includes all of you, else you wouldn\'t be sitting
here.

Therefore the following must be said: When man makes his
observations in the world of senses -- life consists of such
observations -- when man uses the things that he encounters in the
sense world to unfold his will, when he proceeds from observation
to action, and when he lets the combination of such observations
and actions have an effect on his feelings, he stands to a certain
extent on firm ground, for this process has been implanted in him
as a physical being on earth between birth and death. Wherever he
doesn\'t have this firm ground, he looks for it. When he is
expected to believe something, he looks everywhere for the facts
behind it. He asks: What experience proves this or that? He
doesn\'t like to accept something in ordinary life which is not
proven by this or that outward experience. He stands on firm
ground because he says to himself: What is true is what is seen,
what is real is what is held in the hand. The world, the world
order itself, provides a certain security in human life. And
because of this security, man differentiates -- insofar as it is
necessary for ordinary life between birth and death -- he
differentiates between truth and illusion, truth and semblance,
truth and dream. When verification cannot by found, he calls it
semblance. And only by differentiating between true and false,
reality and semblance, is life secure.


Just imagine, my dear friends, that you were to go through life
between birth and death in a way that you could never really know
whether something that confronts you is truth or illusion. You
could not determine whether a person who stands before you and
speaks to you is a real person or the semblance of one. You could
not differentiate between something happening to you being real or
merely a dream. Just imagine what insecurity, what terrible
insecurity that would cause in your
life.

But exactly as you would feel if life were to withdraw the
possibility of knowing whether you were dreaming or confronting
reality, is also the way the adept feels standing at the threshold
of the spiritual world. That is the very first important
experience he has when he realizes that on the other side of the
threshold is the spiritual world.

As we have already seen, only darkness streams at first from
this spiritual world. Yet although here or there brilliant flashes
of light emanate from the darkness -- in which the Guardian of the
Threshold\'s words are heard, as we learned last time -- with all
the knowledge of the senses and reason you may have gleaned in the
physical world, you would never be able to know whether a real
spiritual being, a real spiritual fact stands before you or a
shape in a dream. 

That is the first experience of the spiritual world, that
semblance and reality are mixed up and to differentiate between
semblance and reality is problematic at first. That is something
which should be borne in mind especially by those who have
experienced impressions from the spiritual world not through
normal spiritual training, but due to elementary forces, which can
be the result of any number of things, such as shattering events,
illness and the like. He shouldn\'t deceive himself by saying:
well, now you have the spiritual world, because it could well be
that whatever it is that seems to suddenly shine from out of the
spiritual world is merely an illusion. Therefore the first thing
one must learn in order to enter the spiritual world is the
ability to distinguish between truth and error, between reality
and illusion -- independent of what is experienced in the physical
world. One must acquire completely new capacities for
distinguishing between reality and
illusion.

In our times, when people no longer pay much attention to how
the spiritual world illuminates life, in which they only pay
attention to what is palpable, to what can only be seen by
physical eyes; in our times, when people are completely attuned to
the [overt security which life
between birth an death provides; in these times it is especially
difficult to acquire this capacity to distinguish between truth
and error, reality and semblance in respect to the spiritual
world. It is in this area where the most earnestness is
required.

And where does this come from? You see, when you confront the
outer world as a physical person, you think about this outer
world. And at the same time you have impressions from the physical
world, which in a certain sense slip under your thoughts,
supporting them. You don\'t have to do very much in order to live
in reality. Reality accepts you as a physical reality.


It is quite different in the spiritual world. You must first
grow into the spiritual world. For the spiritual world you must
acquire the correct feeling of your own true reality. Then you
will gradually be able to differentiate between truth and error,
between reality and semblance of reality.


When you sit down on a chair -- at the moment you don\'t fall on
the floor, but are able to sit safely on the chair, you know that
in the physical world the chair is a real chair and not merely an
imagined chair. The chair itself provides proof of its
reality.

That is not the case in the spiritual world. For why is it so in
the physical world? Because in the physical world your thinking,
your feeling, your willing are held together by the physical body.
You are a threefold human being: a thinking, feeling and a willing
human being. But they are all unified within each other by the
physical body.

At the moment when the human being enters the spiritual world,
he immediately becomes a triple being. His thinking goes its own
way, his feeling goes its own way, his willing goes its own way.
So you can think in the spiritual world, have thoughts which have
nothing to do with your willing; but these thoughts are illusions.
You can have feelings which have nothing to do with your willing;
but these feelings contribute to your undoing, not to your
advancement. 

That is the essential thing, that when a person approaches the
threshold of the spiritual world it seems to him that his thinking
flies out into distant space and that his feeling goes beyond his
memory.

Consider for a moment what I just said. You see, memory is
really something which comes very close to the threshold of the
spiritual world. Let\'s say you experienced
[something ten years ago. It
returns in memory. The experience is there again. You are
justifiably satisfied, as far as the physical world is concerned,
if you have a vivid memory of it. For someone who has entered the
spiritual world, however, it is as though he pushes through the
memory, as though he goes farther than the memory reaches. In any
case he goes farther back than his memory of physical earthly life
can reach. He goes back beyond
birth.

And when one enters the spiritual world, he immediately senses
that his feeling does not stay with him. Thinking at least goes
out into the presently existing universe. It disperses, as it
were, in cosmic space. Feeling goes out of the universe and if one
wants to follow feeling one must ask: Where are you now? When you
have become 50 years old, then you have gone back in time farther
than 50 years; you have gone back 70 years, 100 years, 150 years.
Feeling leads you completely out of the time in which you have
lived since childhood.

And willing, if you take it seriously, leads you ever farther
back in time, back to your previous earth lives. That is something
which happens immediately, dear fiends, when you really come to
the threshold of the spiritual world. The physical body ceases
holding you together. One no longer feels within the confines of
the skin; one feels split into
parts.

You feel as though your thoughts, which were previously confined
by feelings, are streaming out into cosmic space and becoming
cosmic thoughts. Your feelings seem to go back in time in the
spiritual world between your last death and your present
[earth life. And with your
volition you feel yourself in your previous earth
life.

It is just this splitting of the human being -- I described it
in my book [How to Attain Knowledge of the Higher
Worlds](https://southerncrossreview.org/Ebooks/ebkohw.htm)-- which
causes difficulties upon entering the spiritual world, because
your thoughts expand. They had previously been held together and
now stream out into cosmos space. At the same time they become
almost imperceptible. So one must achieve the ability to perceive
the thoughts which have thus
expanded.

Feeling is no longer permeated by thoughts, for the thoughts
have gone, so to speak. So your feeling can only turn prayerfully,
with reverence and devotion, to the beings with whom you pass your
life between death and a new birth on earth. This is possible if
one has cultivated such reverence for the spiritual world in
life.

But the moment one\'s volition, which wants to proceed to
previous earth-lives, takes over, the person meets a great
difficulty in that he feels an enormous attraction for the
contents of his lower nature. And here works most strongly what I
previously said about the difficulty in being able to to
differentiate between semblance and reality. For the person
acquires a strong preference for semblance. I\'ll describe it as
follows.

When a person begins to meditate, when he or she is really
dedicated to the meditation, he would like to continue in
tranquility. He does not want it to deprive him of life\'s
comforts. Well, this desire not to be deprived of life\'s comforts
is a strong producer of illusions and semblances. Because when you
dedicate yourself completely to meditation, necessarily from the
depths of your soul the question arises about your capacity for
evil. One cannot do otherwise than to feel through meditation,
through that penetration into the depths, everything you are
capable of perpetrating. But the urge to deny this is so strong
that one submits to the illusion that one is essentially a very
good person.

The real experience of meditation does not indicate such a
result. It shows how one can be full of all kinds of vanity and
overestimation of one\'s self and underestimation of others. Also
one judges people not only because they have something important
to say, but because one wishes to bask in the good opinion of
others. But that is the least of things. He who really meditates
honestly will see what drives live in his soul and what he is
therefore capable of. Man\'s lower nature appears strongly before
the soul\'s inner vision. And this honesty must exist in
mediation. When it is there we can see what the will\'s
disposition really is, which is reflected in the words we have
already heard:


> > Behold the first beast, the crooked back
> > 
> > The bony head, the scrawny body,
> > 
> > His skin is all a dullish blue;
> > 
> > Your fear of creative spiritual being
> > 
> > Begat the monster in your will;


Because the human being tends to succumb to illusion, he
suppresses the impression [that
necessarily arises in meditation, and he feels the urge to mock
the spiritual [world. Only by
honestly facing these opposing forces can he stand in the
spiritual world in the right way. Then the sight of the second
beast appears on the threshold:


> > Behold the second beast, it bares
> > 
> > Its teeth in a warped face, scornfully it lies,
> > 
> > Yellow with gray spots is its body;
> > 
> > Your hate of spiritual revelation
> > 
> > Begat this weakling in your feeling;


And then when we are helpless to follow the thoughts we had in
our heads during earth life and are now cosmic thoughts, because
of this inability to bestride our cosmic thoughts, that the third
beast appears:


> > Behold the third beast, with cloven muzzle,
> > 
> > Its eye is glassy, posture slouching,
> > 
> > Dirty-red its form appears to you;
> > 
> > Your doubts in the power of spiritual light
> > 
> > Begat this ghost within your thinking;


The less we succumb to illusions about this trinity, which
reflects our own being, the more we find in us the true human who
can receive the light from the spiritual world and who is in a
position to really solve the riddle, insofar as it is possible on
earth to do so, which is conceded to us with the words: "O man,
know thyself!". For through this self-knowledge streams forth the
true knowledge of the world which can lead us in the right way
through life. Therefore this threefold splitting in which one\'s
thinking goes its way, feeling goes its way and willing goes its
way, which otherwise are united by exterior forces, may be
expressed by the words the Guardian of the Threshold says to the
adept. We heard them the last
time:


> > The third beast\'s glassy eye,
> > 
> > Is the evil counterpart
> > 
> > Of thinking[, that denies itself
> > 
> > In you and chooses death,
> > 
> > Forsaking the spirit-force
> > 
> > which before it\'s earthly life
> > 
> > Lived its life in fields of spirit.


> > The second beast\'s mocking countenance
> > 
> > Is the evil counter-force of feeling,
> > 
> > Which hollows out its own soul
> > 
> > And creates an empty life
> > 
> > Instead of fullness of spirit
> > 
> > With light from the force of the sun
> > 
> > Before earthly existence.
> > 
> > 
> > The first beast\'s bony spirit:
> > 
> > The will\'s evil creative power,
> > 
> > Which would estrange your own body
> > 
> > From the soul\'s inherent strength
> > 
> > And devote it to the counter-forces,
> > 
> > Which would steal in future time
> > 
> > Cosmic being from the gods.


These are the words spoken by the Guardian as a warning so that
we know how we should enter the spiritual world. Upon entering the spiritual world we
must have become accustomed to a different way of judging, a
different way of feeling and a different way of willing from what
prevails in the physical world. And for that it is really
necessary that we grasp this threefold element within us, that we
firmly direct our gaze within in order to be alert to what our
thinking really is, what our feeling really is, what our willing
really is and what they must become for us to be able to step
across the threshold into the spiritual world, if only in our
thoughts. For the fact is that the gods place will-power before
the bliss of knowledge and they require
it.

Therefore, directly after the Guardian has spoken these
discouraging, perhaps [frightening
words, he continues with the other words which tell us what we
[
do. At this point the first lessons of this class also become
practical in that they instruct us what should enter into our
thinking, feeling and willing forces in order to enter the
spiritual world in the right way. 

And the verse should also be threefold which should flow into us
in a way that we can live with it. For in living with it we are
setting out on the path to the spiritual world. In the same way
that we eat and drink , that we see and hear, must something be
evoked in us by what the Guardian of the Threshold, standing
before the spiritual world, says with earnest
visage.


> > See in yourself the weaving thoughts:
> > 
> > Cosmic semblances confront you,
> > 
> > Selfhood as such hides from you;
> > 
> > Plunge beneath the semblances:
> > 
> > Etheric essence flows in you;
> > 
> > Selfhood as such should revere
> > 
> > Guiding beings of your spirit. 


Let us examine the verse. When the human being lives in the
sense-world between birth and death, he feels to be within his
physical body. He knows that his legs carry him through the world.
He knows that blood circulation gives him life. He knows that his
breathing awakens life. He commits himself to this breathing,
blood circulation and the movement of the members that carry him
through the world. In doing so, he is a physical being on the
earth. Just as he commits himself to these things physically, he
must also commit with his soul to the leading powers of the
spiritual world if he wants to participate in it, knowledgeably
enter into it. 

Just as I must say that for physical health your blood must
circulate in the correct way, you breathing must be in order, I
must also advise the person who wishes to stand correctly in the
spiritual world, that his soul must follow, be sustained and led
by his own spiritual guides:

\[The first verse, beginning with the last words, is written on
the blackboard:\]
