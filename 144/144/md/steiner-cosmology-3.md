A week ago, I tried to explain the manner of thinking, so
strange to western minds, through which the theosophist attains
his insights and knowledge of the cosmos. The sketchy character
these lectures necessarily have prevents me from delving more
profoundly into theosophical cosmology. Nevertheless, I will
attempt today to give you at least a picture in descriptive form
of the origin of the world based on Theosophy. I beg those who
have scientific bents to bear in mind that in the course of
three short lectures it isn't possible to go into scientific
explanations of what I will say today. These scientific
explanations will be included in a subsequent lecture cycle, in
which I will speak in more detail about this subject. Also, in
the second volume of my *Theosophy,* which will soon be published,
cosmology will be discussed. \[A second volume of *Theosophy* never appeared. Instead, Steiner's
*An Outline of Esoteric Science,* which includes a detailed
description of cosmological evolution, was published in 1909.
Ed.\]\

Allow me first of all to mention an
important thought, which is basically very simple, but which
must be clear to whoever wishes to understand evolution in the
theosophical sense. When we speak of development, or evolution
in a broad sense, we don't only mean the development of animal
or plant life from a previous form, but we also mean the great
transformations within the universe, and we include the origin
of matter, the matter we can today perceive with our physical
senses.

We said last time that
in the history of the evolution of our planet there are seven
consecutive stages, and I also briefly described these to you.
You must therefore think of how our earthly planet goes through
seven stages, which we call Rounds, in rhythmical sequence.
Everything that exists and lives on our Earth was also existent
before our present Earth come into being; it was existent in a
kind of seed state, just as a whole plant is present in a seed,
sleeps in the seed, so to speak, before it takes on form in the
outer world. Such a slumber stage is called a "Pralaya". On the
other hand, the state in which everything awakens, gradually
emerges and progresses from a beginning to a high point of
perfection, we call "Manvantara". When the state of perfection
is reached, a Pralaya, a sleeping state, occurs once more, and
this is followed again by a state of waking and growth. Thus the
planet goes through this sequence seven times, reawakening seven
times to a new Round. 

The time between one
Manvantara and the next passes in a state in which everything
living on the earth sleeps, so to speak. But it isn't comparable
to normal human sleep. In normal sleep only the activities of
understanding and sense are interrupted, but you can see the
physical body. The sleeping state of the Earth must be thought
of differently. No earthly being is visible during this sleeping
state. This state would be perceptible only to the opened eye of
the so-called *[Dangma, ]{style="font-style:italic"}*the highest
developed seer. This state is indescribable in words, for our
words are inadequate for this kind of existence. I find no words
in any language for this state. Therefore the developed seer
says something quite different in order to give an idea of this
state. He says: imagine a plant. You see this plant. Now imagine
a kind of plaster impression of the plant, but in such a way
that the plant itself is empty space and a Round is the plaster.
Consider that the plaster is spiritual and only perceptible for
certain senses. Whoever can see the plant cannot see the plaster
impression at the same time, that is, the negative of the plant.
Something similar is what the developed seer would perceive of
the Earth during the Pralaya sleep. The Earth is not there. It
is the hollow form, swimming in a great, mighty sea of the
highest spiritual beings that is gradually disappearing and out
of which the Being of the Earth itself flows.

Then something begins to
originate within this hollow space, something not yet
perceptible to the physical senses; it is only perceptible to
the highly developed seer who can consciously move in the
spiritual plane. At the beginning of the Earth's existence he
would see a sphere in space, a purely spiritual sphere in which
only the spiritual is present. Every time before a new Round
begins, our Earth exists in such a spiritual state. When it
awakens from the Pralaya sleep, it does so as such a sphere. The
spiritual seer perceives it in a wonderful reddish glimmer. But
that Earth contains everything that later becomes Earth. The
densest bodies are also contained in this sphere.

How can we imagine this?
It can be made clear by means of a simple process. Imagine a
glass full of water. The water is fluid. When you cool the
temperature sufficiently, the water becomes ice. You have the
same thing in front of you as previously -- ice is nothing other
than water, only in another form. Raise the temperature and the
ice reverts to water, with higher temperatures even to steam. By
this example you can imagine how all matter derives from the
spirit through densification. The spiritual sphere -- seen only
by the seer's developed eye -- densifies gradually after it
passes through a small Pralaya. It can then be seen by a less
developed seer's eye. Then follows a kind of short sleeping
state, and now the sphere is visible to the astral eye, that is,
for whoever has developed this sense on the astral plane. Again
a Pralaya state follows, and the sphere appears again as
physical solid matter. Only now can physical eyes see it,
physical ears hear it, physical hands grasp it. That is the
fourth stage. Then a short Pralaya comes again. This stage
disappears and again an astral sphere presents itself, but with
much more highly developed beings. An analogous state appears in
the sixth Round, also only visible to the spiritual seer.
Thereafter another Pralaya and then a state only visible to the
highest developed seer. Then follows what is invisible even to
the Dangma. A long Pralaya follows and then the whole process
begins again. This happens seven times. In this way the Earth is
transformed from the lowest to the highest level. 

Let us now follow the
first Round. We can study it best by observing what exists on
our Earth where it is most solid. In the first Round there were
no mineral forms yet, no physical nature energy and no chemical
energy. The Earth had carried out the previous evolution only to
create a foundation for physical existence; it created this
foundation in order to prepare a physical existence in the
fourth Round. Our Earth looked like a fiery mass, with such
tremendous temperatures that none of our present substances
could have the form they now have. All substances were jumbled
up in that fiery primal porridge -- allow me to use that trivial
word -- in homogeneous, undifferentiated matter. Theosophy says:
the Earth was in the fiery stage. Common fire is not meant,
however, but fire of a higher, spiritual nature. There were no
chemical elements involved. But what was in the interior of this
matter was active. Two kinds of spiritual beings were active:
those we call "Dhyani Chohans" \[Archangels in Christian
terminology. Ed\], and those beings who had not yet descended to
physical materiality, who had a partially spiritual body, and
who flowed through the fiery matter with tremendous rapidity. We
see here a continuous emergence and disappearance of irregular
forms, also of forms that remind us of those that will exist on
Earth at a much later time.

The emerging and disappearing seems to follow a pattern. Forms
arise which are reminiscent of later crystals and plants -- even
something that takes on human form, and then disperses. The
humans who would later incarnate lived in that fire, modeling
and preparing their bodies. That is how the Earth's first Round
appears to us. Then followed the transition from this fiery,
flowing Earth to the sleep-state.

The second Round began
in the same spiritual way. "Ether" is finer than our present-day
gas, but denser than the Earth was in the previous stage. In
this very fine matter what we call chemical elements formed. You
can find this second stage wonderfully described in religious
books, where it is written that the divine beings ordered
everything according to mass, number and weight. What had
earlier been irregular was now organized in chemical elements
according to number. The chemist will understand me, for he
knows the regular periodic system of the elements. The
individual substances were not yet related to each other. Now,
however, as matter became differentiated, we see the most
wonderful forms coming into existence which remind us of later
forms, only they are not yet solid: star-like forms, angular
forms, tetrahedrons, polyhedrons, round forms and so on. The
forms that will later constitute nature are intimated. As in the
first Round crystal forms were prearranged, the plant forms were
constituted in the second Round. Then all flowed away; the
astral and spiritual natures went through a Pralaya stage again
and re-appeared in the third Round.

When we consider the
physical state of the third Round, we find matter in a quite
different state. It is not yet differentiated as air and water,
but forms a kind of mist, or steam. It is no longer an ether
form, but rather somewhat as cloud formations are today. And
within these mist formations, which we find described in old
sagas -- the sagas of Nebelheim (home of mist) and Niflheim
describe this state -- we see matter in another form, no longer
organized according to number, but equipped with energy. The
esoteric researcher speaks here of the Law of Selected
Relationships. The chemical substances organize themselves
according to the Law of Selected Relationships. Now, however, in
the third Round, energy emerged, which allowed the small to
become larger and expand. The substances could organize
themselves from within, energize themselves. Not only the first
plant forms, which we met in the second Round, appeared, but
growth was also possible. The first animal forms appeared, which
we would consider to be extremely grotesque today. Gigantically
large, colossal shapes formed themselves out of the mass of
mist. For the occultist there is something of truth when he
looks at the clouds and sees that one cloud looks like a camel,
another like a horse. In the third Round the beings were
mist-like forms, which reproduced by one transforming itself
into the other, one deriving from the other, like the lower cell
organisms, which are reminiscent of this process. These animal
bodies, which formed out of the mist, could now provide the
basis for those individualities who came from previous worlds to
find bodies. The human being could now incarnate. He found a
body which allowed him to appear, at first in an imperfect,
primitive, groping way. Failed incarnations were also possible.
We could say that during the third Round beings existed on the
Earth who were intermediate beings between man and animal, in
which the human being did not feel completely right, but could
nevertheless incarnate.

Then another Pralaya
occurred, and then the fourth Round. That is the Round to which
we belong today. The Earth passed through the spiritual state,
went through the astral and etheric states and finally arrived
at the physical state which we have now reached. During the
first Round the foundation for the mineral kingdom was formed,
during the second Round the foundation for the vegetable kingdom
was formed, during the third Round the possibility for animal
forms was established. And now, during the fourth Round, the
human being acquired the ability to take on the form he has
today.

Let us consider the
state of our physical Earth somewhat more closely. The state of
the Earth in this fourth Round must be described as being much
denser than the states of the previous Rounds. First there was a
fiery state, then a misty one, then one between air and water.
Still during the beginning of the fourth Round we had a kind of
gushing matter, similar to protein. Gradually it all condensed,
and what we have today as matter is nothing other than the
condensed, originally gushing matter, exactly as ice is
condensed water. At the beginning of the fourth Round all beings
were created so they could live in this gushing matter. Man had
a form similar to the one he has now, but his consciousness was
extremely dim, comparable to that of a dreaming person. He
dreamed his being in a kind of sleeping consciousness; the
spirit was still lacking. Let us consider this state more
closely. The human being was possible in that flowing, gushing
state. We call these people of the first race dream-men. It is
difficult to describe them. Another stage followed this one, in
which matter became denser and separated into a more spiritual
and a more physical materiality, comparable to the North and
South Poles.

Now I ask you to
consider the difference between the esoteric and the usual
understanding of Darwinism. We have the human being present in
the indicated stage of the earth, as well as the vegetable
kingdom. The animal kingdom was also present, but without sexual
reproduction capability, without warm blood and not yet capable
of bringing forth sounds. The human being was also mute. He
could not yet think, not even dim thoughts. The spirit had not
yet entered the bodies. In the following, second race, matter
separated into two poles. The human beings withdrew the matter
that was useful to them and separated out the less useful
matter, from which a kind of lateral branch of the higher
animals formed. The lower animals were similar to today's
mollusks, even fish-like forms developed. 

The human being
developed further and at the third stage discarded the matter
that would not enable him to become the bearer of a higher
consciousness. He gave it up as material for the animals, which
now looked like amphibians with gigantic forms. They are
described in fables and myths as flying dragons and so on. Until
then, no being possessed sexual reproductive capacities. Not
until the middle of the third race, the Lemurian epoch, does
this appear, albeit primitively. The scene of this development,
Lemuria, was in Asia in the Indian Ocean. 

During the middle of the
Lemurian age the great event occurred which allowed man to
become a human being. The human beings who came over from
previous planetary states were not all at the same level of
development. Those who had reached a normal evolution during the
previous misty earth cycle were able to incarnate during the
third epoch. Among them, however, there were some who had
already reached a higher stage; they could not incorporate
during the third race at all. During every Round there are
humans who develop to a normal stage and others who are more
advanced. These are the masters. They are more highly developed
individuals. In Theosophy they are called solar pitris or sun
pitris. They had reached a higher spirituality, but could no
more incarnate in the bodies of the men of those times than a
contemporary person could incarnate in a plant. They waited for
further evolution until the appropriate time had come, during
the fourth race, when their incarnation could take place. Thus a
spiritually highly developed humanity arose. The sagas and myths
relate how at that time personalities existed who rose far above
their fellow men. Individuals such as Prometheus, the Indian
Rishis, Fire-Rishis, who were the leaders of humanity, including
Manus, who gave later humanity laws. Only these solar Pitris
could incarnate as adepts. 

I already mentioned that
at the start of the fourth Round sexuality did not yet exist.
The separation of the sexes occurred only during the Lemurian
time. Therewith the first incarnations were possible, the taking
over of a body which hadn't already existed. Previously one
being derived from another. With the separation of the sexes
during the middle of the Lemurian age, birth and death arose and
therefore the possibility of the effects of karma. The human
being could burden himself with guilt. Everything we know as
"human" arose at that time.

The Lemurian continent
was destroyed by a fire-like catastrophe, and the Atlantian
continent arose on the floor of what is now the Atlantic Ocean.
During the Atlantian time another important event occurred to
which I drew your attention when I spoke of the Whitson holiday.
I said that, with the exception of the solar Pitris, all beings
lived in a lower spiritual condition. The solar Pitris could
only take on selected bodies. Other bodies would only have
allowed them to live with a dim consciousness. Dull- minded
individuals would have resulted had they used the existent
bodies. The Pitris therefore waited until certain animal-like
forms evolved further. On the one hand they sank deeper into
instinctual desires, but on the other hand, by this means the
prerequisites for the later development of the brain were given.
Matter was differentiated into nervous matter and sexual matter.
The Pitris who had waited for that later time incarnated in this
inferior matter. Religion indicates this as the biblical fall
from paradise: the incarnation in worsened matter. If that
hadn't happened, they would have remained in a much less
conscious state. They would not have attained the clear thinking
we now posses, but would have remained in a much duller state.
They paid for this by allowing their bodies to be inferior,
which however was compensated for by refined brain matter,
thereby allowing them to achieve a higher level of consciousness
and spirituality. A particular result of the evolution of the
Atlantian race was the development of a phenomenal
memory.

After Atlantis was
destroyed by water, continued evolution resulted in our
contemporary fifth race, during which deductive reasoning was a
special achievement. This enabled the human race to bring art
and science to a high level of development, which previously had
not been possible. During the fifth sub-race of the fourth Round
humanity reached a highpoint: control by the spirit, which had
incarnated in matter, so that humanity could ascend to higher
and higher stages of evolution.

We have seen how the
cosmos evolved in rhythmic stages to the point where we now
stand. In previous Rounds the following developed:

1. the mineral kingdom
2. the vegetable kingdom
3. the animal kingdom 
    and then-
4. the human being 

Theosophical cosmology is a self-contained whole, derived from
the wisdom of the most developed seers. If I had a little more
time I would be able to indicate to you how certain natural
scientific facts are conducive to testifying to the accuracy of
this image of the world. Look at Haekel's famous phylogenic
trees, for example, in which evolution is materialistically
explained. If instead of matter you consider the spiritual
stages, as Theosophy describes them, then you can make the
phylogenic trees as Haekel did -- only the explanation is
different. 

In order that you do not confuse what I have said with what is
described in many theosophical books as the various astral or
physical states, I would like to bring the following to your
attention. Evolution is often described as if they were
concurrent stages. You find spheres placed next to each other,
so that it appears as though life went from one sphere to
another. In reality only one sphere exists, and only its
conditions change. It is always the same sphere which goes
through the various metamorphoses: spiritual, astral, physical,
and so on.

We have seen that the introduction to these lectures, which we
took from Goethe's words, is completely justified -- that it is
after all the human being who is the goal, the task of the
earthly planet. The esotericist knows that every planet has its
specific task. Nothing in the cosmos is
coincidental.

The task of physical evolution is that what is created for us
humans achieve its objective. You will not find a human being as
he is today on Earth on any other planet. Beings, yes -- but not
human beings. The Earth exists in order that "I"-conscious human
beings could be created. Through the first four Rounds the
kingdoms of nature evolved in order that in the fourth man could
be made a self-conscious being, who could reflect himself in his
body. He will rise to higher levels of evolution, something that
few can understand correctly. In the next, the fifth Round, the
mineral kingdom will disappear. All mineral matter will be
transformed to vegetable matter. Then the vegetable kingdom will
reach its culmination and in the next Round the animal kingdom
will form the lowest kingdom. During the seventh Round the human
being will achieve his highest level of evolution. He will have
become what planetary evolution intends.

Whoever understands this can have a profounder insight into the
religious documents. There was a time when people believed like
children in the religious documents. Then the Enlightenment
came, and nothing is believed any more. But a time will come
when people will learn to understand the images preserved for us
in religious documents, fairy tales and fables. Thus we have the
seven Rounds as the seven days of creation in the Bible. The
first three days of creation have gone by, we are now in the
fourth day of creation and the last three days of creation are
yet to come. The first three days of creation in Genesis
represent the past Rounds, and the last three indicate what is
to come in the future. Rightly understood, Moses wanted to say
with the description of the first three days, that we live in
the fourth Round; he describes the fourth day of creation in a
quite special way. That is why you find a double creation in
Genesis \[This may refer to Genesis 1, 26, where God creates
humankind. In Genesis 2, 7, this creation is described again,
albeit differently. Ed\] Those who judge the Bible with their
intellect only will never understand it. The human being of the
seventh day of creation has not been created. That man was made
of clay is a symbol of our fourth Round. The double creation
tells us in images of what has been created, the stage in which
we now find ourselves, and of the stage at the end of the
seventh Round. When we see the Bible's message in this way, a
meaning of these documents suddenly arises which we could not
have previously understood. Humanity will finally see that there
is such a profound meaning there that one would almost have to
become a different person in order to understand
it.

It is necessary that in our times the high, spiritual meaning
of these old documents be revealed, and that is the task of the
theosophical movement. It doesn't criticize the materialism of
our times because it considers it to be necessary. But it
strives to enable people to again recognize the spiritual
meaning of these documents. We will work on this during the
coming winter. Today's lecture is the last of this cycle. We
will, however, still meet here every Monday at eight
o'clock.
