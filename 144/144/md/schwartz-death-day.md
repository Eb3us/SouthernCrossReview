### Reflections on Rudolf Steiner’s Death Day  

## By Eugene Schwartz

It may seem
strange to include a commemoration of Rudolf Steiner’s Death Day in
a newsletter that is devoted to the
celebration of childhood, and new initiatives, and
life
in general,
but even in the midst of so much life the Waldorf movement is obliged to
face death. This article is an effort to understand this obligation.  

The six-year period that extended from the spring of 1919 to Rudolf
Steiner’s death on March 29, 1925, was filled with a rapid progression
of triumphs — and tragedies. Among the tragedies were the fruitless
efforts to heal Europe’s war wounds through the Threefold Social Order,
the burning of the First Goetheanum, and Steiner’s long and debilitating
illness. Among the triumphs were the refounding of the Anthroposophical
Society and the powerful and prolific outpouring of the
Karmic
Relationships
lectures.
It was during this period that Rudolf Steiner also helped to found,
nurture, and advise what he was to call the “Daughter Movements,”
practical efforts to apply spiritual principles directly in contemporary
society.  

The daughter movements established vocations that made possible a unique
path of modern Initiation. Teachers, doctors, priests, and farmers no
longer had to retreat to mystery centers or ashrams to develop
spiritually but were given the meditative exercises and practical
challenges that allowed them to unfold their higher faculties while in
the workplace. Waldorf Education, anthroposophically-extended medicine,
the Christian Community, and Bio-Dynamic Agriculture have already, or
will soon, celebrate their one hundredth anniversaries, and each has its
own tales of success and failure. This article will focus on the special
role that Waldorf education has to play among its sister movements.  

It is important to note that the prequel to the celebration of one
hundred years of Waldorf education involved a pitched battle over
measles vaccinations in several schools. The conflict led to the
collateral damage of a lawsuit brought by Waldorf parents followed by an
embarrassing and viral article in magazine. Hardly had the US Waldorf movement
recovered from that debacle than it had to face the insuperable
challenge of a pandemic and school closings that coincided with
Steiner’s Death Day in 2020. The celebratory AWSNA national conference
in June was canceled, and in most respects the festival year fell flat.
What might the daughter movements learn from this? \[ AWSNA=”Association
of Waldorf Schools of North America” ed.\]  

Perhaps we are mistaken when we try to celebrate the anniversaries of
the daughter movements one at a time. It may be more helpful to regard
the six miraculous years between the spring of 1919 and the spring of
1925 as a a single temporal gesture guided by the Time
Spirit Michael. No less importantly, we should recognize that the period
from 2019 to 2025 has the potential to be at once a recapitulation of
the 1919-1925 era anda point of departure for the next hundred
years. We must also be aware that these six years have the potential to
be a time of unraveling. A few poor decisions and hasty compromises and
the spiritual impulses that guided Rudolf Steiner in the twentieth
century may be weakened or undone at the same breathless pace with which
they were activated a century ago.  

The direct spiritual guidance of an Initiate can persist for one hundred
years, after which it fades from its embodiment in books and
institutions and must be revitalized by individuals who have made those
teachings their own. In this respect, the years 2019-2025 offer the
final possibility of drawing upon Rudolf Steiner’s teachings. As of
March 29, 2022, we stand at the half-way point in this six-year
recapitulation. Significantly, it was at the precise mid-point of the
six-year period during Steiner’s own lifetime (March 16, 1922) that
misjudgments about the viability of the Threefold Social Order led to
the financial ruin of the Waldorf Astoria Cigarette Factory and the
termination of other efforts of economic transformation that he had
helped to found. And that occurred with Rudolf Steiner still alive and
well!  

Every moment of the next three years will cast its light or shadow over
the next century of endeavors founded by Steiner. Unfortunately, the way
Waldorf institutions, the eldest of the daughter movements, have
navigated the turbulent waters of the past years foreshadow hard times
ahead. Going forward, the relationship of Rudolf Steiner to his
Daughters may look much less like The Twelve Dancing Princesses
and a lot
more like King
Lear.  

#### What's in a name?
In an oft-quoted interview on a 1955 broadcast of
See It Now,
the
commentator Edward R Murrow asked Jonas Salk, developer of the first
polio vaccine, “Who owns the patent on this vaccine?” to which Salk
responded, “Well, the people, I would say. There is no patent. Could you
patent the sun?” Nearly four decades later, this question might have
been posed again as the Association of Waldorf Schools of North America
transmogrified the term “Waldorf Education,” and later “Rudolf Steiner
Education,” into Service Marks.  

Rudolf Steiner once said that institutions created by human beings have
a lifespan that parallels the “biblical” human life span, i.e. seventy
years. As it approaches that threshold, the corporation, or
not-for-profit, or association should engage in its own dismantling and
share its resources and expertise with younger endeavors. Through such a
“death and transmigration” the spiritual impulse underlying the older
institution may be revitalized in a new and youthful body. As the 1990s
approached and the worldwide Waldorf movement attained its seventieth
year, the time had come for such a metamorphosis so that the Michaelic
Sun-impulse carried by existing Waldorf schools might expand into more
diverse directions. On the dual pretext that it was “protecting Rudolf
Steiner” — particularly from the Internet attacks of the Waldorf
Critics’ List — and that it was ensuring that “Waldorf” would never
become generic term like “Kleenex,” AWSNA pulled down the shade and drew
the light more tightly to itself.  

As it happened, the 1990s were the decade during which the first charter
schools cultivating Waldorf educational principles were being founded.
It was also the time that the Internet not only extended the reach of
Waldorf’s opponents, but also enhanced the resources and networking
power of some of Waldorf’s most passionate adherents, among them
countless American homeschoolers. At the very moment that the impulse of
Waldorf education was ripe to cross the threshold of its transformation,
the North American Waldorf movement was ready to adapt to new forms and
directions and reach families from a broader sector of society.  

How did AWSNA respond to this spiritual turning point? By contracting,
excluding, and holding the Service Mark in a rigor mortis grip. For
nearly thirty years, AWSNA’s apparatchiks sent reams of threatening
letters to charter schools, public school districts, and even Facebook
groups that were attempting to expand the scope of Rudolf Steiner’s
educational impulses. The heroic efforts of Kim John Payne in his battle
against bullying Waldorf schools were strangely paralleled by
AWSNA’s bullying Waldorf schools. It is ironic to realize
that Steiner was himself opposed to calling the original “Free School”
in Stuttgart a “Waldorf School,” because he felt that the name would
evoke images of billboards promoting cigarettes. In Steiner’s eyes,
“Waldorf” already a commodity; he might be amused to hear the
sanctimonious tones with which AWSNA speaks its Name.  

The Service Mark may indeed have served as a life support system in the
Association’s dotage, giving it both power (to accept and reject school
candidates) and glory (“We own the Service Mark!”). However, it does not
seem to have had any helpful effect on declining enrollments in the
independent Waldorf schools, nor on the diminishing number of new
independent schools forming in North America. In those areas, at least,
the torch has clearly been passed to the schools practicing Waldorf
education in the public and homeschool spheres. There are other
Association missteps that are beyond the scope of this article but which
I explore in my lecture course [Does Waldorf Still
Matter](http://iwaldorf.net/matter.html). However, there is one more destiny-laden
error that relates directly to Rudolf Steiner’s death day.  

#### The Portal of Denunciation  

As it crossed from the first hundred years of Waldorf education to the
next hundred years, AWSNA posted on its web page a statement that
signaled a recognition, however unconscious, that Rudolf Steiner’s
direct help to the independent Waldorf school movement was ending. This
statement was the denunciation of Rudolf Steiner’s “racist statements.”
It was composed in a tone of such sophomoric certainty and moral
superiority that it all but cried, “You’re fired!” to the spiritual
beings who nurture Waldorf education. With this (later mysteriously
retracted) sentence, the independent Waldorf school movement in the
United States accelerated the severance from Rudolf Steiner’s life and
work that will very likely come to a not-so grand culmination in 2025.  

As I indicated earlier in this article, Steiner’s direct influence must
ineluctably wane over the next three years, so this severance need not
be regarded as a failure. What a failure, however, is that that this portal
of denunciation was established not out of spiritually-imbued
understanding, but rather out of conformity to influences in many
respects antithetical to Waldorf education. The AWSNA conference of
June, 2021, in which Anthroposophy and Rudolf Steiner were rarely
mentioned and the adjective “Waldorf” was mostly codified as
“Eurocentric,” exemplified the spiritual impoverishment that is likely
to hold sway in the near future.  

Although there certainly was some sincere idealism and earnestness
behind the denunciation, it also served as yet another distraction,
masking the spiritual emptiness that underlies AWSNA and many of its
member schools in the twenty-first century. Taking a stand for Social
Justice is easy in today’s media climate— just plug in the terms and
concepts and acronyms that others provide, and you are
Working out of Anthroposophy is far more
demanding, calling for clear thinking, individual judgment, and the
struggle to be — awake.  

Indeed, every time AWSNA takes up a new social justice cause, it means
more meetings and required workshops for faculty, and very likely a new
staff position in the school: DEI Coordinator, BIPOC Rep, Cyber Civics
Director, LGBTQ Liaison, and so on. And this is in addition to the
plethora of staff already in place: Advancement, Development,
Enrollment. The more that AWSNA schools strive to be centers of Social
Justice, the more they look and act like bureaucracies. With such a
top-heavy structure, and with so little attention going to the
pedagogical concerns of teachers, parents, and even students, we must
concur with Yeats’ phrase, “The center cannot hold.”  

#### Small is beautifull
With all of this in mind, I would like to suggest how the Waldorf
movement may appear when the current three-year grace period comes to a
close.

1. The unsustainable corporate model of the AWSNA member independent
    schools will lead to the closing of smaller schools and the
    hollowing out of the larger “established” schools. Having
    constrained the role of their class teachers and elevated academics
    over Imagination, many schools will be Waldorf in Service Mark only.
    No longer supported by the living impulse of Anthroposophy, they
    will be “legacy schools,” basking in their achievements during the
    independent schools’ Golden Age of the 1970s and 1980s, but out of
    touch with the needs of the children of the twenty-first century.
    The most committed anthroposophists among the faculty will have
    mostly been fired or retired, and while one or two teachers in a
    school who have tried to make Steiner’s path their own will continue
    to do some good in their constrained setting, they will be a
    disappearing breed. Because their schools are no longer supported by
    the spiritual world, they cannot, in turn, support the spiritual
    striving of their teachers. And this, in turn, means that teachers
    who continue to work out of Anthroposophy are doing so out of a
    genuine impulse of not because it is on their job
    description. For the most part, however, the type of idealistic and
    spiritually striving young people who joyfully became independent
    Waldorf school teachers in the twentieth century will now be drawn
    to biodynamic farming, the Christian Community, or work in Camphill
    villages. 2025 will mark the long “beginning of the end” for AWSNA
    and its institutions.
2. As of
    this writing, there are sixty public Waldorf schools serving over
    15,000 children. By 2025 that number will nearly double, and by 2030
    “Waldorf” will be perceived by academia and the media as a
    public
    schoolmethodology and will have far greater
    impact in the United States than the AWSNA membership schools could
    ever attain. The degree of spiritual support that public Waldorf
    schools may receive will depend less on their teachers and more on
    the caliber and inner life of their The strongest and most cohesive public
    Waldorf schools are guided by administrators who recognize the
    crucial role of Steiner’s methodology in the Waldorf classroom and
    respect the striving and initiative of teachers who find ways to
    bring it to life within the public-school setting. At the same time
    there are administrators who have little interest in, or even
    antipathy towards, the spiritual foundations of Waldorf methodology.
    Through their opposition they, too, will have a role to play in the
    expansion of Steiner’s educational impulse into the public sector.
    In the present three-year period, these schools stand at the “end of
    the beginning.” They are likely to attain their own Golden Age
    mid-century, and by the last third of the century, at age 70, will
    be ready to pass on their resources to their
    successors.

3.  And who are those successors? Although the pandemic lockdown that
    commenced in the spring of 2020 threw many Waldorf schools into a
    state of panic and shortsighted responses, there were two groups of
    Waldorf practitioners that weathered the storm with equanimity. The
    one group included the thousands of homeschoolers whose children
    were already at home, and the second group was composed of the
    online Waldorf classrooms that did not have to scramble to plug into
    glitchy Internet services like Zoom and Google Classroom because
    they were already adept at distance learning. The unfortunate
    confluence of AWSNA’s pressure on its member schools to eviscerate
    the Waldorf curriculum in the name of euro-cleansing and its sudden
    celebratory acceptance of computers and mobile devices as learning
    tools led many parents to search for alternatives. This, in turn,
    has contributed to the founding of “homeschool pods” and “micro
    schools” serving families who, for the most part, want their
    children to receive a “real” Waldorf education, rather than the
    simulacra being offered in all too many schools. So many experienced
    Waldorf teachers and committed Waldorf families have joined or even
    helped to found these centers that we can speak of a ”Waldorf
    Diaspora,” the sort of migration of peoples that very often marks a
    new spiritual/cultural tipping point. One need only look at the
    “Jobs Listings” in this newsletter to recognize how many such
    endeavors have begun, and how rapidly their enrollments have grown.
    For many of these first adapters, such community schools offer an
    opportunity to teach in the spirit of “applied Anthroposophy”
    described by Rudolf Steiner as the basis of Waldorf education. For
    others, it means the possibility of working more deeply and
    effectively with smaller classes and providing the individualized
    attention that children’s paths of incarnation necessitate. The
    flexibility and mobility that such smaller schools possess gives
    them the responsiveness so needed in our tempestuous times. It is
    likely that many such schools will be established on the grounds of
    biodynamic farms and vineyards, anthroposophical clinics, near
    Christian Community chapels, and in Camphill villages. That is to
    say, Rudolf Steiner’s eldest daughter will take up residence with
    her younger sisters, and her new home will become the community
    school. And it is no less possible that such schools could be
    founded in neighborhoods in America’s inner cities. The
    hand-wrenching and justifiable guilt to which Waldorf schools
    subject themselves concerning their mostly white populations would
    be easily overcome by moving their campuses to urban locations with
    populations of color. The micro school model provides such a
    possibility.

If the mission of an independent Waldorf school depends on the spiritual
life of its teachers and that of a public Waldorf school on the inner
striving as of its administrator, then a great deal of what transpires
in the Waldorf community school movement will depend on the inner path
of its parents. Since the turn of the century there has been a dearth of
parent education throughout the Waldorf movement as schools quietly
covered their spiritual foundations. It is to be hoped that the families
actively engaged in forming these new schools will also be diligent in
their work with Anthroposophy. The hundreds of online and community
schools that will arise over the next decades will spread the Waldorf
impulse quietly throughout the continent, like a homeopathic remedy.
Although Waldorf homeschooling has been a reality for decades, in its
new iteration it marks the birth of a third stage of North American
Waldorf education that is likely to take on a multiplicity of forms
throughout the twenty-first century and reach its apogee at the
threshold of 2100.  

The best step for the shrinking independent Waldorf and the thriving
public Waldorf schools to take right now would be to connect with local
homeschoolers — even disaffected former school parents — and offer
low-cost classes and activities to their children. Such a program has
been in operation at the Yuba River charter school for several years and
is exemplary in its scope and organization, while the Moraine Farm
independent Waldorf school offers a homeschoolers’ program that is
imbued with arts and crafts. Such programs are not only of mutual
benefit in the here-and-now but will also make for a much more graceful
transfer of a school’s resources and accumulated wisdom when its own
mission has come to an end. For the next three years, in preparation for
the century to come, may the Waldorf school movement “be busy being
born” and, no less earnestly, “busy dying.”
