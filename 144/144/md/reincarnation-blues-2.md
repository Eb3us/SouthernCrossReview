# Reincarnation Blues -- Canto II

## by Frank Thomas Smith

I\'d really like again to live\
Not this long, but longer still.\
Would I then have more to give\
With more to feel but weaker will?

There was a time in northern climes\
When I thought and felt and sought\
And willed, but failed in troubled times;\
And countless were the lies I bought.

Then in seasons southern born\
Fluttered the spirit\'s broken wing,\
Or was it an angel in female form\
Whose beauty made the cosmos sing?

When I ask myself what\
I\'m doing here I shake my head.\
It\'s neither cold here nor hot,\
The feeling I have is one of dread.

For what if I\'d traveled so long and far\
With little to show than a belly pot?\
Well, but I loved and went to war\
The war was won, the love was not.

You think it depends on what you choose.\
You better think again, baby\
And heed the Reincarnation Blues:\
Fate does the choosing, or at least maybe.
