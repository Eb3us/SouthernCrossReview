# Reincarnation Blues -- Canto IV

![From Ascent of the Blessed by Hieronymus Bosch](ascent-boscb.jpg){class="a"}

## by Frank Thomas Smith

Meditating on the mother of questions,\
(I don\'t mean the coronavirus\
Or the first class esoteric lessons)\
But the one that necessarily concerns us:

Sooner or later you\'ll want to know\
If life has meaning and if so: what?\
We can start be presuming the answer is: no!\
If that\'s the case are we alive or: not?

Or are we actors in a computer game\
As the movie Matrix wonkly warned?\
Like death itself it\'s all the same:\
No one emerges wholly unharmed.

But if life -- human life I mean --\
Is real, then so are you and I\
Not to mention nature\'s green\
Life of leaves that will also die.

Don\'t bother going to church\
To confess your tawdry trespasses;\
It\'ll surely leave you in the lurch\
Cause God doesn\'t give freepasses.

The killing going on with so much terror\
Could make you resort to Brother Booze\
But that would be a fateful error\
Intones the Reincarnation Blues.
