<main style="display:flex;flex-direction:column;align-items:center">
  <div>
<p class="intropoem">Make no mistake: if he rose at all<br />
It was as His body;<br />
If the cell’s dissolution did not reverse, the molecule reknit,<br />
The amino acids rekindle,<br />
The Church will fall.</p>
<p>It was not as the flowers,<br />
Each soft spring recurrent;<br />
It was not as His Spirit in the mouths and fuddled eyes of the<br />
Eleven apostles;<br />
It was as His flesh; ours.</p>
<p>The same hinged thumbs and toes<br />
The same valved heart<br />
That—pierced—died, withered, paused, and then regathered<br />
Out of enduring Might<br />
New strength to enclose.</p>
<p>Let us not mock God with metaphor,<br />
Analogy, sidestepping, transcendence,<br />
Making of the event a parable, a sign painted in the faded<br />
Credulity of earlier ages:<br />
Let us walk through the door.</p>
<p>The stone is rolled back, not papier-mache,<br />
Not a stone in a story,<br />
But the vast rock of materiality that in the slow grinding of<br />
Time will eclipse for each of us<br />
The wide light of day.</p>
<p>And if we have an angel at the tomb,<br />
Make it a real angel,<br />
Weighty with Max Planck’s quanta, vivid with hair, opaque in<br />
The dawn light, robed in real linen<br />
Spun on a definite loom.</p>
<p>Let us not seek to make it less monstrous,<br />
For our own convenience, our own sense of beauty,<br />
Lest, awakened in one unthinkable hour, we are embarrassed<br />
By the miracle,<br />
And crushed by remonstrance.</p>
