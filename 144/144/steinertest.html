<h3>Lesson Three</h3>
<p>Translated from the German by Frank Thomas Smith<br />
Dornach, February 29, 1924</p>
<p>Let us begin, my dear friends, with the words the Guardian speaks –
words we already know – when pointing in the direction of the spiritual
world, which characterize what the human being can feel on the threshold
of the spiritual world as he strides past the Guardian.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>From the wide expanse of beings in space<br />
Who experience existence in light,<br />
From the tread of time's onward course<br />
Which finds in creating its very activity;<br />
From the depths of the feeling heart<br />
Where in the Self the world is founded:<br />
<br />
There resounds in the soul's utterance,<br />
There shines from the spirit's thoughts,<br />
Which from divine healing forces<br />
in the cosmic-creative forces<br />
Weave the mighty existential words:<br />
O Man, know thyself!</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It's about the path one should follow in thought, the path which one
will actually take when seeking access to the spiritual world. And we
should not say that when someone experiences in thought – if he honestly
and earnestly lives in his thoughts – what the person in process of
initiation realizes in reality by entering the spiritual world, that the
former does not actually participate in what is revealed to the human
soul when entering the spiritual world, because it is only a reflected
ideation.</p>
<p>One should not say: Let's leave gaining entrance into the spiritual
world to those who are striving to be initiates and stand with their
souls in the spiritual world as people stand in physical existence with
their senses. Rather should one say: When even in thought one approaches
the description of the path that leads to the spiritual world, and
provided the thinking is not superficial, he will experience and feel
fully what it means to leave the world of the senses behind, a world
only the intellect can grasp, and enter the spiritual world.</p>
<p>That is what I will speak to you about today, my dear friends, and
not merely for those who already seek the transformation which will lead
them into the spiritual world, but also for those who, at first, only
experience the transformation in their thoughts. And that includes all
of you, else you wouldn't be sitting here.</p>
<p>Therefore the following must be said: When man makes his observations
in the world of senses – life consists of such observations – when man
uses the things that he encounters in the sense world to unfold his
will, when he proceeds from observation to action, and when he lets the
combination of such observations and actions have an effect on his
feelings, he stands to a certain extent on firm ground, for this process
has been implanted in him as a physical being on earth between birth and
death. Wherever he doesn't have this firm ground, he looks for it. When
he is expected to believe something, he looks everywhere for the facts
behind it. He asks: What experience proves this or that? He doesn't like
to accept something in ordinary life which is not proven by this or that
outward experience. He stands on firm ground because he says to himself:
What is true is what is seen, what is real is what is held in the hand.
The world, the world order itself, provides a certain security in human
life. And because of this security, man differentiates – insofar as it
is necessary for ordinary life between birth and death – he
differentiates between truth and illusion, truth and semblance, truth
and dream. When verification cannot by found, he calls it semblance. And
only by differentiating between true and false, reality and semblance,
is life secure.</p>
<p>Just imagine, my dear friends, that you were to go through life
between birth and death in a way that you could never really know
whether something that confronts you is truth or illusion. You could not
determine whether a person who stands before you and speaks to you is a
real person or the semblance of one. You could not differentiate between
something happening to you being real or merely a dream. Just imagine
what insecurity, what terrible insecurity that would cause in your
life.</p>
<p>But exactly as you would feel if life were to withdraw the
possibility of knowing whether you were dreaming or confronting reality,
is also the way the adept feels standing at the threshold of the
spiritual world. That is the very first important experience he has when
he realizes that on the other side of the threshold is the spiritual
world.</p>
<p>As we have already seen, only darkness streams at first from this
spiritual world. Yet although here or there brilliant flashes of light
emanate from the darkness – in which the Guardian of the Threshold's
words are heard, as we learned last time – with all the knowledge of the
senses and reason you may have gleaned in the physical world, you would
never be able to know whether a real spiritual being, a real spiritual
fact stands before you or a shape in a dream.</p>
<p>That is the first experience of the spiritual world, that semblance
and reality are mixed up and to differentiate between semblance and
reality is problematic at first. That is something which should be borne
in mind especially by those who have experienced impressions from the
spiritual world not through normal spiritual training, but due to
elementary forces, which can be the result of any number of things, such
as shattering events, illness and the like. He shouldn't deceive himself
by saying: well, now you have the spiritual world, because it could well
be that whatever it is that seems to suddenly shine from out of the
spiritual world is merely an illusion. Therefore the first thing one
must learn in order to enter the spiritual world is the ability to
distinguish between truth and error, between reality and illusion –
independent of what is experienced in the physical world. One must
acquire completely new capacities for distinguishing between reality and
illusion.</p>
<p>In our times, when people no longer pay much attention to how the
spiritual world illuminates life, in which they only pay attention to
what is palpable, to what can only be seen by physical eyes; in our
times, when people are completely attuned to the [overt security which
life between birth an death provides; in these times it is especially
difficult to acquire this capacity to distinguish between truth and
error, reality and semblance in respect to the spiritual world. It is in
this area where the most earnestness is required.</p>
<p>And where does this come from? You see, when you confront the outer
world as a physical person, you think about this outer world. And at the
same time you have impressions from the physical world, which in a
certain sense slip under your thoughts, supporting them. You don't have
to do very much in order to live in reality. Reality accepts you as a
physical reality.</p>
<p>It is quite different in the spiritual world. You must first grow
into the spiritual world. For the spiritual world you must acquire the
correct feeling of your own true reality. Then you will gradually be
able to differentiate between truth and error, between reality and
semblance of reality.</p>
<p>When you sit down on a chair – at the moment you don't fall on the
floor, but are able to sit safely on the chair, you know that in the
physical world the chair is a real chair and not merely an imagined
chair. The chair itself provides proof of its reality.</p>
<p>That is not the case in the spiritual world. For why is it so in the
physical world? Because in the physical world your thinking, your
feeling, your willing are held together by the physical body. You are a
threefold human being: a thinking, feeling and a willing human being.
But they are all unified within each other by the physical body.</p>
<p>At the moment when the human being enters the spiritual world, he
immediately becomes a triple being. His thinking goes its own way, his
feeling goes its own way, his willing goes its own way. So you can think
in the spiritual world, have thoughts which have nothing to do with your
willing; but these thoughts are illusions. You can have feelings which
have nothing to do with your willing; but these feelings contribute to
your undoing, not to your advancement.</p>
<p>That is the essential thing, that when a person approaches the
threshold of the spiritual world it seems to him that his thinking flies
out into distant space and that his feeling goes beyond his memory.</p>
<p>Consider for a moment what I just said. You see, memory is really
something which comes very close to the threshold of the spiritual
world. Let's say you experienced [something ten years ago. It returns in
memory. The experience is there again. You are justifiably satisfied, as
far as the physical world is concerned, if you have a vivid memory of
it. For someone who has entered the spiritual world, however, it is as
though he pushes through the memory, as though he goes farther than the
memory reaches. In any case he goes farther back than his memory of
physical earthly life can reach. He goes back beyond birth.</p>
<p>And when one enters the spiritual world, he immediately senses that
his feeling does not stay with him. Thinking at least goes out into the
presently existing universe. It disperses, as it were, in cosmic space.
Feeling goes out of the universe and if one wants to follow feeling one
must ask: Where are you now? When you have become 50 years old, then you
have gone back in time farther than 50 years; you have gone back 70
years, 100 years, 150 years. Feeling leads you completely out of the
time in which you have lived since childhood.</p>
<p>And willing, if you take it seriously, leads you ever farther back in
time, back to your previous earth lives. That is something which happens
immediately, dear fiends, when you really come to the threshold of the
spiritual world. The physical body ceases holding you together. One no
longer feels within the confines of the skin; one feels split into
parts.</p>
<p>You feel as though your thoughts, which were previously confined by
feelings, are streaming out into cosmic space and becoming cosmic
thoughts. Your feelings seem to go back in time in the spiritual world
between your last death and your present [earth life. And with your
volition you feel yourself in your previous earth life.</p>
<p>It is just this splitting of the human being – I described it in my
book <a href="https://southerncrossreview.org/Ebooks/ebkohw.htm">How to
Attain Knowledge of the Higher Worlds</a>– which causes difficulties
upon entering the spiritual world, because your thoughts expand. They
had previously been held together and now stream out into cosmos space.
At the same time they become almost imperceptible. So one must achieve
the ability to perceive the thoughts which have thus expanded.</p>
<p>Feeling is no longer permeated by thoughts, for the thoughts have
gone, so to speak. So your feeling can only turn prayerfully, with
reverence and devotion, to the beings with whom you pass your life
between death and a new birth on earth. This is possible if one has
cultivated such reverence for the spiritual world in life.</p>
<p>But the moment one's volition, which wants to proceed to previous
earth-lives, takes over, the person meets a great difficulty in that he
feels an enormous attraction for the contents of his lower nature. And
here works most strongly what I previously said about the difficulty in
being able to to differentiate between semblance and reality. For the
person acquires a strong preference for semblance. I'll describe it as
follows.</p>
<p>When a person begins to meditate, when he or she is really dedicated
to the meditation, he would like to continue in tranquility. He does not
want it to deprive him of life's comforts. Well, this desire not to be
deprived of life's comforts is a strong producer of illusions and
semblances. Because when you dedicate yourself completely to meditation,
necessarily from the depths of your soul the question arises about your
capacity for evil. One cannot do otherwise than to feel through
meditation, through that penetration into the depths, everything you are
capable of perpetrating. But the urge to deny this is so strong that one
submits to the illusion that one is essentially a very good person.</p>
<p>The real experience of meditation does not indicate such a result. It
shows how one can be full of all kinds of vanity and overestimation of
one's self and underestimation of others. Also one judges people not
only because they have something important to say, but because one
wishes to bask in the good opinion of others. But that is the least of
things. He who really meditates honestly will see what drives live in
his soul and what he is therefore capable of. Man's lower nature appears
strongly before the soul's inner vision. And this honesty must exist in
mediation. When it is there we can see what the will's disposition
really is, which is reflected in the words we have already heard:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Behold the first beast, the crooked back</p>
<p>The bony head, the scrawny body,</p>
<p>His skin is all a dullish blue;</p>
<p>Your fear of creative spiritual being</p>
<p>Begat the monster in your will;</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Because the human being tends to succumb to illusion, he suppresses
the impression [that necessarily arises in meditation, and he feels the
urge to mock the spiritual [world. Only by honestly facing these
opposing forces can he stand in the spiritual world in the right way.
Then the sight of the second beast appears on the threshold:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Behold the second beast, it bares</p>
<p>Its teeth in a warped face, scornfully it lies,</p>
<p>Yellow with gray spots is its body;</p>
<p>Your hate of spiritual revelation</p>
<p>Begat this weakling in your feeling;</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>And then when we are helpless to follow the thoughts we had in our
heads during earth life and are now cosmic thoughts, because of this
inability to bestride our cosmic thoughts, that the third beast
appears:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Behold the third beast, with cloven muzzle,</p>
<p>Its eye is glassy, posture slouching,</p>
<p>Dirty-red its form appears to you;</p>
<p>Your doubts in the power of spiritual light</p>
<p>Begat this ghost within your thinking;</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The less we succumb to illusions about this trinity, which reflects
our own being, the more we find in us the true human who can receive the
light from the spiritual world and who is in a position to really solve
the riddle, insofar as it is possible on earth to do so, which is
conceded to us with the words: “O man, know thyself!”. For through this
self-knowledge streams forth the true knowledge of the world which can
lead us in the right way through life. Therefore this threefold
splitting in which one's thinking goes its way, feeling goes its way and
willing goes its way, which otherwise are united by exterior forces, may
be expressed by the words the Guardian of the Threshold says to the
adept. We heard them the last time:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The third beast's glassy eye,</p>
<p>Is the evil counterpart</p>
<p>Of thinking[, that denies itself</p>
<p>In you and chooses death,</p>
<p>Forsaking the spirit-force</p>
<p>which before it's earthly life</p>
<p>Lived its life in fields of spirit.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The second beast's mocking countenance</p>
<p>Is the evil counter-force of feeling,</p>
<p>Which hollows out its own soul</p>
<p>And creates an empty life</p>
<p>Instead of fullness of spirit</p>
<p>With light from the force of the sun</p>
<p>Before earthly existence.</p>
<p>The first beast's bony spirit:</p>
<p>The will's evil creative power,</p>
<p>Which would estrange your own body</p>
<p>From the soul's inherent strength</p>
<p>And devote it to the counter-forces,</p>
<p>Which would steal in future time</p>
<p>Cosmic being from the gods.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>These are the words spoken by the Guardian as a warning so that we
know how we should enter the spiritual world. Upon entering the
spiritual world we must have become accustomed to a different way of
judging, a different way of feeling and a different way of willing from
what prevails in the physical world. And for that it is really necessary
that we grasp this threefold element within us, that we firmly direct
our gaze within in order to be alert to what our thinking really is,
what our feeling really is, what our willing really is and what they
must become for us to be able to step across the threshold into the
spiritual world, if only in our thoughts. For the fact is that the gods
place will-power before the bliss of knowledge and they require it.</p>
<p>Therefore, directly after the Guardian has spoken these discouraging,
perhaps [frightening words, he continues with the other words which tell
us what we [ do. At this point the first lessons of this class also
become practical in that they instruct us what should enter into our
thinking, feeling and willing forces in order to enter the spiritual
world in the right way.</p>
<p>And the verse should also be threefold which should flow into us in a
way that we can live with it. For in living with it we are setting out
on the path to the spiritual world. In the same way that we eat and
drink , that we see and hear, must something be evoked in us by what the
Guardian of the Threshold, standing before the spiritual world, says
with earnest visage.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>See in yourself the weaving thoughts:</p>
<p>Cosmic semblances confront you,</p>
<p>Selfhood as such hides from you;</p>
<p>Plunge beneath the semblances:</p>
<p>Etheric essence flows in you;</p>
<p>Selfhood as such should revere</p>
<p>Guiding beings of your spirit.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Let us examine the verse. When the human being lives in the
sense-world between birth and death, he feels to be within his physical
body. He knows that his legs carry him through the world. He knows that
blood circulation gives him life. He knows that his breathing awakens
life. He commits himself to this breathing, blood circulation and the
movement of the members that carry him through the world. In doing so,
he is a physical being on the earth. Just as he commits himself to these
things physically, he must also commit with his soul to the leading
powers of the spiritual world if he wants to participate in it,
knowledgeably enter into it.</p>
<p>Just as I must say that for physical health your blood must circulate
in the correct way, you breathing must be in order, I must also advise
the person who wishes to stand correctly in the spiritual world, that
his soul must follow, be sustained and led by his own spiritual
guides:</p>
<p>[The first verse, beginning with the last words, is written on the
blackboard:]</p>
