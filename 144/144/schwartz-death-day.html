<h1>Three More Years:</h1>
<h3>Reflections on Rudolf Steiner’s Death Day</h3>
<h2>By Eugene Schwartz</h2>
	
</header>
<main>

<p class="intro">It may seem strange to include a commemoration of Rudolf Steiner’s
Death Day in a newsletter that is devoted to the celebration of
childhood, and new initiatives, and life in general, but even in the
midst of so much life the Waldorf movement is obliged to face death.
This article is an effort to understand this obligation.</p>
<p>The six-year period that extended from the spring of 1919 to Rudolf
Steiner’s death on March 29, 1925, was filled with a rapid progression
of triumphs — and tragedies. Among the tragedies were the fruitless
efforts to heal Europe’s war wounds through the Threefold Social Order,
the burning of the First Goetheanum, and Steiner’s long and debilitating
illness. Among the triumphs were the refounding of the Anthroposophical
Society and the powerful and prolific outpouring of the Karmic
Relationships lectures. It was during this period that Rudolf Steiner
also helped to found, nurture, and advise what he was to call the
“Daughter Movements,” practical efforts to apply spiritual principles
directly in contemporary society.</p>
<p>The daughter movements established vocations that made possible a
unique path of modern Initiation. Teachers, doctors, priests, and
farmers no longer had to retreat to mystery centers or ashrams to
develop spiritually but were given the meditative exercises and
practical challenges that allowed them to unfold their higher faculties
while in the workplace. Waldorf Education, anthroposophically-extended
medicine, the Christian Community, and Bio-Dynamic Agriculture have
already, or will soon, celebrate their one hundredth anniversaries, and
each has its own tales of success and failure. This article will focus
on the special role that Waldorf education has to play among its sister
movements.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the prequel to the celebration of one
hundred years of Waldorf education involved a pitched battle over
measles vaccinations in several schools. The conflict led to the
collateral damage of a lawsuit brought by Waldorf parents followed by an
embarrassing and viral article in magazine. Hardly had the US Waldorf
movement recovered from that debacle than it had to face the insuperable
challenge of a pandemic and school closings that coincided with
Steiner’s Death Day in 2020. The celebratory AWSNA national conference
in June was canceled, and in most respects the festival year fell flat.
What might the daughter movements learn from this? [ AWSNA=”Association
of Waldorf Schools of North America” ed.]</p>
<p>Perhaps we are mistaken when we try to celebrate the anniversaries of
the daughter movements one at a time. It may be more helpful to regard
the six miraculous years between the spring of 1919 and the spring of
1925 as a a single temporal gesture guided by the Time Spirit Michael.
No less importantly, we should recognize that the period from 2019 to
2025 has the potential to be at once a recapitulation of the 1919-1925
era anda point of departure for the next hundred years. We must also be
aware that these six years have the potential to be a time of
unraveling. A few poor decisions and hasty compromises and the spiritual
impulses that guided Rudolf Steiner in the twentieth century may be
weakened or undone at the same breathless pace with which they were
activated a century ago.</p>
<p>The direct spiritual guidance of an Initiate can persist for one
hundred years, after which it fades from its embodiment in books and
institutions and must be revitalized by individuals who have made those
teachings their own. In this respect, the years 2019-2025 offer the
final possibility of drawing upon Rudolf Steiner’s teachings. As of
March 29, 2022, we stand at the half-way point in this six-year
recapitulation. Significantly, it was at the precise mid-point of the
six-year period during Steiner’s own lifetime (March 16, 1922) that
misjudgments about the viability of the Threefold Social Order led to
the financial ruin of the Waldorf Astoria Cigarette Factory and the
termination of other efforts of economic transformation that he had
helped to found. And that occurred with Rudolf Steiner still alive and
well!</p>
<p>Every moment of the next three years will cast its light or shadow
over the next century of endeavors founded by Steiner. Unfortunately,
the way Waldorf institutions, the eldest of the daughter movements, have
navigated the turbulent waters of the past years foreshadow hard times
ahead. Going forward, the relationship of Rudolf Steiner to his
Daughters may look much less like The Twelve Dancing Princesses and a
lot more like King Lear.</p>
<h4>What’s in a name?</h4>
<p>In an oft-quoted interview on a 1955 broadcast of See It Now, the
commentator Edward R Murrow asked Jonas Salk, developer of the first
polio vaccine, “Who owns the patent on this vaccine?” to which Salk
responded, “Well, the people, I would say. There is no patent. Could you
patent the sun?” Nearly four decades later, this question might have
been posed again as the Association of Waldorf Schools of North America
transmogrified the term “Waldorf Education,” and later “Rudolf Steiner
Education,” into Service Marks.</p>
<p>Rudolf Steiner once said that institutions created by human beings
have a lifespan that parallels the “biblical” human life span,
i.e. seventy years. As it approaches that threshold, the corporation, or
not-for-profit, or association should engage in its own dismantling and
share its resources and expertise with younger endeavors. Through such a
“death and transmigration” the spiritual impulse underlying the older
institution may be revitalized in a new and youthful body. As the 1990s
approached and the worldwide Waldorf movement attained its seventieth
year, the time had come for such a metamorphosis so that the Michaelic
Sun-impulse carried by existing Waldorf schools might expand into more
diverse directions. On the dual pretext that it was “protecting Rudolf
Steiner” — particularly from the Internet attacks of the Waldorf
Critics’ List — and that it was ensuring that “Waldorf” would never
become generic term like “Kleenex,” AWSNA pulled down the shade and drew
the light more tightly to itself.</p>
<p>As it happened, the 1990s were the decade during which the first
charter schools cultivating Waldorf educational principles were being
founded. It was also the time that the Internet not only extended the
reach of Waldorf’s opponents, but also enhanced the resources and
networking power of some of Waldorf’s most passionate adherents, among
them countless American homeschoolers. At the very moment that the
impulse of Waldorf education was ripe to cross the threshold of its
transformation, the North American Waldorf movement was ready to adapt
to new forms and directions and reach families from a broader sector of
society.</p>
<p>How did AWSNA respond to this spiritual turning point? By
contracting, excluding, and holding the Service Mark in a rigor mortis
grip. For nearly thirty years, AWSNA’s apparatchiks sent reams of
threatening letters to charter schools, public school districts, and
even Facebook groups that were attempting to expand the scope of Rudolf
Steiner’s educational impulses. The heroic efforts of Kim John Payne in
his battle against bullying Waldorf schools were strangely paralleled by
AWSNA’s bullying Waldorf schools. It is ironic to realize that Steiner
was himself opposed to calling the original “Free School” in Stuttgart a
“Waldorf School,” because he felt that the name would evoke images of
billboards promoting cigarettes. In Steiner’s eyes, “Waldorf” already a
commodity; he might be amused to hear the sanctimonious tones with which
AWSNA speaks its Name.</p>
<p>The Service Mark may indeed have served as a life support system in
the Association’s dotage, giving it both power (to accept and reject
school candidates) and glory (“We own the Service Mark!”). However, it
does not seem to have had any helpful effect on declining enrollments in
the independent Waldorf schools, nor on the diminishing number of new
independent schools forming in North America. In those areas, at least,
the torch has clearly been passed to the schools practicing Waldorf
education in the public and homeschool spheres. There are other
Association missteps that are beyond the scope of this article but which
I explore in my lecture course <a
href="http://iwaldorf.net/matter.html">Does Waldorf Still Matter</a>.
However, there is one more destiny-laden error that relates directly to
Rudolf Steiner’s death day.</p>
<h4>The Portal of Denunciation</h4>
<p>As it crossed from the first hundred years of Waldorf education to
the next hundred years, AWSNA posted on its web page a statement that
signaled a recognition, however unconscious, that Rudolf Steiner’s
direct help to the independent Waldorf school movement was ending. This
statement was the denunciation of Rudolf Steiner’s “racist statements.”
It was composed in a tone of such sophomoric certainty and moral
superiority that it all but cried, “You’re fired!” to the spiritual
beings who nurture Waldorf education. With this (later mysteriously
retracted) sentence, the independent Waldorf school movement in the
United States accelerated the severance from Rudolf Steiner’s life and
work that will very likely come to a not-so grand culmination in
2025.</p>
<p>As I indicated earlier in this article, Steiner’s direct influence
must ineluctably wane over the next three years, so this severance need
not be regarded as a failure. What a failure, however, is that that this
portal of denunciation was established not out of spiritually-imbued
understanding, but rather out of conformity to influences in many
respects antithetical to Waldorf education. The AWSNA conference of
June, 2021, in which Anthroposophy and Rudolf Steiner were rarely
mentioned and the adjective “Waldorf” was mostly codified as
“Eurocentric,” exemplified the spiritual impoverishment that is likely
to hold sway in the near future.</p>
<p>Although there certainly was some sincere idealism and earnestness
behind the denunciation, it also served as yet another distraction,
masking the spiritual emptiness that underlies AWSNA and many of its
member schools in the twenty-first century. Taking a stand for Social
Justice is easy in today’s media climate— just plug in the terms and
concepts and acronyms that others provide, and you are Working out of
Anthroposophy is far more demanding, calling for clear thinking,
individual judgment, and the struggle to be — awake.</p>
<p>Indeed, every time AWSNA takes up a new social justice cause, it
means more meetings and required workshops for faculty, and very likely
a new staff position in the school: DEI Coordinator, BIPOC Rep, Cyber
Civics Director, LGBTQ Liaison, and so on. And this is in addition to
the plethora of staff already in place: Advancement, Development,
Enrollment. The more that AWSNA schools strive to be centers of Social
Justice, the more they look and act like bureaucracies. With such a
top-heavy structure, and with so little attention going to the
pedagogical concerns of teachers, parents, and even students, we must
concur with Yeats’ phrase, “The center cannot hold.”</p>
<h4>Small is beautifull</h4>
<p>With all of this in mind, I would like to suggest how the Waldorf
movement may appear when the current three-year grace period comes to a
close.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The unsustainable corporate model of the AWSNA member independent
schools will lead to the closing of smaller schools and the hollowing
out of the larger “established” schools. Having constrained the role of
their class teachers and elevated academics over Imagination, many
schools will be Waldorf in Service Mark only. No longer supported by the
living impulse of Anthroposophy, they will be “legacy schools,” basking
in their achievements during the independent schools’ Golden Age of the
1970s and 1980s, but out of touch with the needs of the children of the
twenty-first century. The most committed anthroposophists among the
faculty will have mostly been fired or retired, and while one or two
teachers in a school who have tried to make Steiner’s path their own
will continue to do some good in their constrained setting, they will be
a disappearing breed. Because their schools are no longer supported by
the spiritual world, they cannot, in turn, support the spiritual
striving of their teachers. And this, in turn, means that teachers who
continue to work out of Anthroposophy are doing so out of a genuine
impulse of not because it is on their job description. For the most
part, however, the type of idealistic and spiritually striving young
people who joyfully became independent Waldorf school teachers in the
twentieth century will now be drawn to biodynamic farming, the Christian
Community, or work in Camphill villages. 2025 will mark the long
“beginning of the end” for AWSNA and its institutions.</p></li>
<li><p>As of this writing, there are sixty public Waldorf schools
serving over 15,000 children. By 2025 that number will nearly double,
and by 2030 “Waldorf” will be perceived by academia and the media as a
public schoolmethodology and will have far greater impact in the United
States than the AWSNA membership schools could ever attain. The degree
of spiritual support that public Waldorf schools may receive will depend
less on their teachers and more on the caliber and inner life of their
The strongest and most cohesive public Waldorf schools are guided by
administrators who recognize the crucial role of Steiner’s methodology
in the Waldorf classroom and respect the striving and initiative of
teachers who find ways to bring it to life within the public-school
setting. At the same time there are administrators who have little
interest in, or even antipathy towards, the spiritual foundations of
Waldorf methodology. Through their opposition they, too, will have a
role to play in the expansion of Steiner’s educational impulse into the
public sector. In the present three-year period, these schools stand at
the “end of the beginning.” They are likely to attain their own Golden
Age mid-century, and by the last third of the century, at age 70, will
be ready to pass on their resources to their successors.</p></li>
<li><p>And who are those successors? Although the pandemic lockdown that
commenced in the spring of 2020 threw many Waldorf schools into a state
of panic and shortsighted responses, there were two groups of Waldorf
practitioners that weathered the storm with equanimity. The one group
included the thousands of homeschoolers whose children were already at
home, and the second group was composed of the online Waldorf classrooms
that did not have to scramble to plug into glitchy Internet services
like Zoom and Google Classroom because they were already adept at
distance learning. The unfortunate confluence of AWSNA’s pressure on its
member schools to eviscerate the Waldorf curriculum in the name of
euro-cleansing and its sudden celebratory acceptance of computers and
mobile devices as learning tools led many parents to search for
alternatives. This, in turn, has contributed to the founding of
“homeschool pods” and “micro schools” serving families who, for the most
part, want their children to receive a “real” Waldorf education, rather
than the simulacra being offered in all too many schools. So many
experienced Waldorf teachers and committed Waldorf families have joined
or even helped to found these centers that we can speak of a ”Waldorf
Diaspora,” the sort of migration of peoples that very often marks a new
spiritual/cultural tipping point. One need only look at the “Jobs
Listings” in this newsletter to recognize how many such endeavors have
begun, and how rapidly their enrollments have grown. For many of these
first adapters, such community schools offer an opportunity to teach in
the spirit of “applied Anthroposophy” described by Rudolf Steiner as the
basis of Waldorf education. For others, it means the possibility of
working more deeply and effectively with smaller classes and providing
the individualized attention that children’s paths of incarnation
necessitate. The flexibility and mobility that such smaller schools
possess gives them the responsiveness so needed in our tempestuous
times. It is likely that many such schools will be established on the
grounds of biodynamic farms and vineyards, anthroposophical clinics,
near Christian Community chapels, and in Camphill villages. That is to
say, Rudolf Steiner’s eldest daughter will take up residence with her
younger sisters, and her new home will become the community school. And
it is no less possible that such schools could be founded in
neighborhoods in America’s inner cities. The hand-wrenching and
justifiable guilt to which Waldorf schools subject themselves concerning
their mostly white populations would be easily overcome by moving their
campuses to urban locations with populations of color. The micro school
model provides such a possibility.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If the mission of an independent Waldorf school depends on the
spiritual life of its teachers and that of a public Waldorf school on
the inner striving as of its administrator, then a great deal of what
transpires in the Waldorf community school movement will depend on the
inner path of its parents. Since the turn of the century there has been
a dearth of parent education throughout the Waldorf movement as schools
quietly covered their spiritual foundations. It is to be hoped that the
families actively engaged in forming these new schools will also be
diligent in their work with Anthroposophy. The hundreds of online and
community schools that will arise over the next decades will spread the
Waldorf impulse quietly throughout the continent, like a homeopathic
remedy. Although Waldorf homeschooling has been a reality for decades,
in its new iteration it marks the birth of a third stage of North
American Waldorf education that is likely to take on a multiplicity of
forms throughout the twenty-first century and reach its apogee at the
threshold of 2100.</p>
<p>The best step for the shrinking independent Waldorf and the thriving
public Waldorf schools to take right now would be to connect with local
homeschoolers — even disaffected former school parents — and offer
low-cost classes and activities to their children. Such a program has
been in operation at the Yuba River charter school for several years and
is exemplary in its scope and organization, while the Moraine Farm
independent Waldorf school offers a homeschoolers’ program that is
imbued with arts and crafts. Such programs are not only of mutual
benefit in the here-and-now but will also make for a much more graceful
transfer of a school’s resources and accumulated wisdom when its own
mission has come to an end. For the next three years, in preparation for
the century to come, may the Waldorf school movement “be busy being
born” and, no less earnestly, “busy dying.”</p>
