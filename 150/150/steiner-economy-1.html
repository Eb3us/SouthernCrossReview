<p class="intro">Ladies and Gentlemen,</p>
<p>Today I intend a kind of introduction. In tomorrow's lecture we shall
begin and try to give a more or less complete picture of the questions
of social and political economy which man today must set before
himself.</p>
<p>The subject of Economics, as we speak of it today, is in reality a
very recent creation. It did not arise until the time when the economic
life of modern peoples had become extraordinarily complicated in
comparison with earlier conditions. As this Course is intended primarily
for students of Political Economy, it is necessary by way of
introduction to point out this peculiarity of the economic thinking of
today.</p>
<p>After all, we need not go very far back in history to see how much
economic life has changed, even during the nineteenth century. You need
only consider this one fact: England, for example, already had, during
the first half of the century, what was practically the modern form of
economic life. There was comparatively little radical change in the
economic structure of England in the course of the nineteenth century.
The great social questions which arise out of economic questions in
modern times were being asked in England as early as the first half of
the nineteenth century: and those who wanted to think of social and
economic questions in the modern sense could pursue their studies in
England at a time when in Germany — for instance — such studies must
have remained unfruitful. In England, above all, the conditions of trade
and commerce on a large scale had already come into being by the first
third of the nineteenth century. Through the great development of trade
and commerce in the economic life in England, a foundation was already
there in the shape of trade capital. In England there was no need to
seek for any other starting-point for modern economic life. They simply
had to apply the trade capital resulting from the consolidation of trade
and commerce even as early as the first third of the nineteenth century.
Starting from this time, everything took place in England with a certain
logical consistency; only we must not forget that the whole of this
English economic life was only possible on the basis originally given by
England's relation to her colonies, especially to India. The whole of
the English economic system is unthinkable without the relationship of
England to India. In other words, English economic life, with all its
facility for evolving large sums of capital, is founded on the fact that
there lies in the background a country which is, as it were, virgin
economic soil. We must not overlook this fact, especially when we pass
from England to Germany.</p>
<p>If you consider the economic life of Germany you will see that in the
first third of the nineteenth century it still essentially corresponded
to economic customs which had arisen out of the Middle Ages. The
economic customs and relationships within Germany in the first third of
the nineteenth century were essentially old: consequently the whole
tempo of economic life was different in Germany from what it was in
England during the first third, or even the first half, of the
nineteenth century. In England, during the first half of the century,
there was already what we may call a reckoning with quickly changing
habits of life. The main character of economic life remained essentially
the same: but it was already adaptable to quickly changing habits. In
Germany, on the other hand, habits of life were still conservative:
economic development could afford to advance at a snail's pace, for it
had only to adapt itself to technical conditions, which remained more or
less the same over long periods, and to human needs, which were not
rapidly changing.</p>
<p>But in this respect a great transformation took place in the second
third of the nineteenth century. Then there rapidly took place an
approximation to English conditions, a development of the industrial
system. In the first half of the nineteenth century Germany had been in
all essentials an agrarian country: now it was rapidly transformed into
an industrial country, far more rapidly than any other region of the
Earth.</p>
<p>But there is an important fact in this connection. We might describe
it thus: In England the transition to an industrial condition of life
took place instinctively: nobody knew exactly how it happened. It came
like an event of Nature. In Germany, it is true, the medieval character
still existed in the first third of the nineteenth century. Germany was
an agrarian country. But while the outer economic conditions were taking
their accustomed course in a way that might almost be called medieval,
human thinking was undergoing a fundamental change. It came into the
consciousness of men that something altogether different must now arise,
that the existing conditions were no longer true to the time. Thus the
transformation of economic conditions which arose in Germany in the
second third of the nineteenth century took place far more consciously
than in England. In Germany people were far more aware of how they
entered into modern capitalism: in England people were not aware of it
at all. If you read today all the writings and discussions in Germany
during that period concerning the transition to industrialism, you will
get a remarkable impression, a strange impression, of how the people in
Germany were thinking. Why, they actually looked upon it as a real
liberation of mankind: they called it Liberalism, Democracy. Nay, more,
they regarded it as the very salvation of mankind to get right out of
the old connections, the old binding links, the old kind of corporation,
and pass over to the fully free position (for so they called it) of the
individual within the economic life. Hence in England you will never
meet with a theory of Economics such as was developed by the people who
received their education in Germany in the height of the period which I
have now characterised. Schmoller, Roscher and others derived their
views from the heyday of this “Liberalism” in Political Economy. What
they built up was altogether in this sense, and they built it with full
consciousness. An Englishman would have thought such theories of
Economics stale and boring; he would have said: “One does not trouble to
think about such things.” Look at the radical difference between the way
in which people in England talked about these things (to mention even a
man like Beaconsfield, who was theoretical enough in all conscience)
from the way in which Richter or Lasker or even Brentano were speaking
in Germany. In Germany, therefore, this second period was entered into
with full consciousness.</p>
<p>Then came the third period, the period essentially of the State. It
is true, is it not, that as the last third of the nineteenth century
drew near, the German State was consolidated purely by means of external
power. That which was consolidated was not what the idealists of '48 or
even of the 1830's had desired: no, it was the “State” that was
consolidated, and moreover by means of sheer force. And this State, by
and by, requisitioned the economic life with full consciousness for its
own purposes. Thus, in the last third of the nineteenth century, the
structure of the economic life was permeated through and through by the
very opposite principle to the previous one. In the second third of the
century its evolution had been subject to the ideas of “Liberalism.” Now
its evolution became altogether subject to the idea of the State. This
was what gave the economic life in Germany, as a whole, its stamp. It is
true that there were elements of consciousness in the whole process, and
yet in another sense the whole thing was quite unconscious.</p>
<p>But the most important thing is this: Through all these developments
a radical contrast, an antagonism <em>of principle,</em> was created,
not only in thought but in the whole conduct of economic life itself
between the English and the Mid-European economy. And, ladies and
gentlemen, on this contrast the manner of their economic intercourse
depended. The whole economy of the nineteenth century, as it evolved
into the twentieth, would be unthinkable without this contrast between
the West and Middle Europe. The way in which men sold, the way in which
they found a market for their goods, the way in which they manufactured
them, all this would be unthinkable without this contrast.</p>
<p>This was the course of development. First the economic and industrial
life of England became possible on the basis of her possession of India:
next it became possible for the whole economic activity to be extended
on the basis of the contrast between the Western and the Mid-European
economic life. In effect, the economic life is founded not on what one
sees in one's immediate surroundings, but on the great reciprocal
relationships in the world at large.</p>
<p>Now it was with this contrast that the world as a whole entered into
the state of world-economy and — could not enter! For the world
continued to depend on that instinctive element which had evolved from
the past, and the existence of which I have just indicated in describing
the antithesis between England and Mid-Europe. In the twentieth century,
though the world was unaware of the fact, we stood face to face with
this situation. The antithesis became more and more immediate, it became
deeper and deeper: and we stood before this great question: The economic
conditions had evolved out of these antitheses or contrasts and, having
done so, they were carrying the contrasts themselves ever more intensely
into the future. And yet, if the contrast were to go on for ever
increasing, economic intercourse would become impossible. This was the
great question of the twentieth century: The contrast had created the
economic life; the economic life had in turn enhanced the contrast. The
contrast was calling for a solution. The question was: How are these
contrasts or antagonisms to be resolved? The further course of history
was destined to prove that men were incapable of finding the answer.</p>
<p>It would have been practical to talk in words like these in 1914, in
the days of peace. But, in place of a solution, there came the result of
failure to find such a world-historic solution. Such was the disease
which then set in, seen from the economic aspect.</p>
<p>You must recognise that the possibility of all evolution always
depends on contrasts or antitheses in the last resort. I will only
mention one example. Through the fact that the English economic life had
been consolidated far earlier than the Mid-European, the English were
unable to make certain goods at prices as cheap as were possible in
Germany. Thus, there arose the great contrast or antagonism of
competition, for “Made in Germany” was simply a question of competition.
And when the war was over, this question could arise: Now that people
have knocked each other's heads in, instead of seeking a solution of
existing contrasts, how can we deal with the matter? At this time I
could not but believe in the possibility of finding human beings who
would understand the contrasts which must be brought forth in another
domain. For life depends on contrasts, and can only exist if contrasts
are there, interacting with one another. Thus in 1919 one could come to
the point of saying: Let us now draw attention to the real contrasts or
contra-positions towards which world-historic evolution is tending —
those of the economic life, the political life of rights and the
spiritual-cultural life — the contra-positions of the threefold social
order.</p>
<p>What, after all, was the actual situation when we believed that we
must bring the threefold idea into as many human heads as possible? I
will only describe it externally today. The important thing would have
been to bring the threefold idea into as many heads as possible before
the economic consequences ensued which afterwards took place. You must
remember when the “Threefold Commonwealth” was first mentioned, we did
not yet stand face to face with the monetary difficulties of today. On
the contrary, if the Threefold Commonwealth had been understood at that
time, these difficulties could never have occurred. Yet once again we
were faced by the inability of human beings to understand such a thing
as this in a really practical sense. When we tried to bring the
Threefold Commonwealth home to them, people would come and say: “Yes,
all that is excellent: we see it perfectly. But, after all, the first
thing needful is to counteract the depreciation of the currency.” Ladies
and gentlemen, all that one could answer was: “That is contained in the
Threefold Order. Set to work with the Threefold Order. That is the only
means of counteracting the depreciation of the currency.” People were
asking how to do the very thing which the Threefold Commonwealth was
meant to do. They did not understand it, however often they declared
that they did.</p>
<p>And now the position is such that if we are to speak once more today
to people such as you, we can no longer speak in the same forms as we
did then. Today another language is necessary: and that is what I want
to give you in these present lectures. I want to show you how one must
think once more today about these questions, especially if, being young
in years, one will still have an opportunity to play one's part in
shaping the immediate future.</p>
<p>Thus, on the one hand, we can characterise a certain period — the
nineteenth century — in terms of world-historic economic contrasts. But
we might also go still farther back and include the time when men first
began to think about Political Economy at all. If you take the history
of Political Economy you will see that everything before that time took
place instinctively. It was only in modern times that there arose that
complexity of economic life, in the midst of which men felt it necessary
to think about these things.</p>
<p>Now I am speaking, in effect, for students. I am trying to show how
students of Economics should find their way into this subject. Let me,
therefore, now relate the most essential thing on which it all
depends.</p>
<p>You see, the time when men had to begin to think about Political
Economy was just the time when they no longer had the thoughts to
comprehend such a subject. They simply no longer had the requisite
ideas. I will give you an example from Natural Science to indicate that
this is so.</p>
<p>We as human beings have our physical bodies, which are heavy just
like any other physical bodies. Your physical body will be heavier after
a midday meal than before: we could even weigh the difference. That is
to say, we partake in the general laws of gravity. But with this
gravity, which is the property of all ponderable substances, we could do
very little in our human body, we could at most go about the world as
automata, certainly not as conscious beings. I have often explained what
is essential to any valid concept of these matters. I have often said
what man needs for his thinking. The human brain, if we weigh it alone,
weighs about 1,400 grammes. If you let the weight of these 1,400 grammes
press on the veins and arteries, which are situated at the base of the
skull, it would destroy and kill them. You could not live for a single
moment if the human brain were pressing downward with its full 1,400
grammes. It is indeed a fortunate thing for man that the principle of
Archimedes holds good. I mean that every body loses so much of its
weight in water as is the weight of that fluid which it displaces. If
this is a heavy body, it loses as much of its weight in water as a body
of water of equal size would weigh. The brain swims in the
cerebro-spinal fluid, and thereby loses 1,380 grammes: for such is the
weight of a body of cerebro-spinal fluid of the size of the human brain.
The brain only presses downward on to the base of the skull with a
weight of 20 grammes, and this weight it can bear. But if we now ask
ourselves: What is the purpose of all this? then we must answer: With a
brain which was a mere ponderable mass, we could not think. We do not
think with the heavy substance: we think with the buoyancy. The
substance must first lose its weight. Only then can we think. We think
with that which flies away from the earth.</p>
<p>But we are also conscious in our whole body. How do we become thus
conscious? In our whole body there are 25 billions of red blood
corpuscles. These 25 billions of red corpuscles are very minute.
Nevertheless they are heavy: they are heavy for they contain iron. Every
one of these 25 billions of red corpuscles swims in the serum of the
blood, and loses weight exactly in accordance with the fluid it
displaces. Once again, therefore, in every single blood corpuscle an
effect of buoyancy is created — 25 billion times. Throughout our body we
are conscious by virtue of this upward driving force. Thus we may say:
Whatever foodstuffs we consume, they must first, to a very large extent,
be divested of their weight: they must be transformed in order that they
can serve us. Such is the demand of the living body.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, to think thus and to regard this way of
thinking as essential, is the very thing men <em>ceased</em> to do just
at the time when it became necessary to think in terms of Political
Economy. Thenceforward they only reckoned with ponderable substances:
they no longer thought of the transformation which a substance undergoes
in a living organism — as to its weight, for example, through the effect
of buoyancy.</p>
<p>And now another thing. If you call to mind your studies of Physics,
you will remember the physicist speaks of the “spectrum.” This band of
colours is created with the help of the prism: red, orange, yellow,
green, blue, indigo, violet. So far (from the red to the violet) the
spectrum appears luminous. But, as you know, before the region which
shows a luminous effect, what are called the infra-red rays are assumed
to exist: and, beyond the violet, the ultra-violet rays. If, therefore,
one speaks merely of light, one does not include the totality of the
phenomenon: for we must go on to describe how the light is transformed
in two opposite directions; we must explain how, beyond the red, light
sinks into the element of warmth and, beyond the violet, into chemical
effects. In both directions the light, as such, disappears. If,
therefore, we give a theory of light alone, we are giving a mere
extract. (The current theory of light is in any case not a true one. It
is significant that in the very time when mankind had to begin to think
consciously of Political Economy, human thinking upon Physics was in
such a condition as to result, among other things, in an untrue theory
of light).</p>
<p>I have, however, mentioned the matter here with some reason: for
there is a valid analogy. Consider for a moment not the economy of
peoples, but, let us say, the economy of sparrows or the economy of
swallows. They too, after all, have a kind of economy. But this — the
economy of the animal kingdom — does not reach far up into the human
kingdom, Possibly in the case of the magpie we may indeed speak of a
kind of animal capitalism. But what is the essence of animal economics?
It is this: Nature provides the products, and the animal as a single
creature takes them for him-self. Man does indeed reach down into this
animal economy: but he has to emerge from it.</p>
<p>The true human economy may be compared to the part of the spectrum
which is visible as light. That which reaches down into Nature would
then be comparable with the part of the spectrum which extends into the
infra-red. Here, for example, we come into the domain of agriculture, of
economic geography and so forth. The science of Economics cannot be
sharply defined in this direction: it reaches down into a region which
must be grasped by very different methods. That on the one hand.</p>
<p>But on the other hand — just under the influence of the very
complicated relations of today — it has gradually come to pass that our
economic thinking fails us once more in another direction. Just as light
ceases to appear as light, as we go on into the ultraviolet, so does
human economic activity cease to be purely economic. I have often
characterised how this came about. The phenomenon began only in the
nineteenth century. Till then, the economic life was still more or less
dependent on the capability and efficiency of the individual human
being. A Bank prospered if some individual in it was a thoroughly
capable person. Individuals were still of real importance. I have often
related, as an amusing example, the story of the ambassador of the King
of France who once came to Rothschild. He was trying to raise a loan.
Rothschild happened to be in conversation with a leather merchant. When
the ambassador of the King of France was announced, he said: “Ask him to
wait a little.” The ambassador was terribly upset. Was he to wait, while
a leather merchant was in there with Rothschild? When the attendant came
out and told him, he simply would not believe his ears. “Go in again and
tell Herr Rothschild that I am here as the ambassador of the King of
France.” But the attendant brought the same answer again: “Will you
kindly wait a little?” Thereupon he himself burst into the inner room:
“I am the ambassador of the King of France!” Rothschild answered:
“Please sit down: will you take a chair?” “Yes, but I am the ambassador
of the King of France!” “Will you take two chairs!”</p>
<p>You see, what took place in the economic life in that time was placed
consciously within the sphere of the human personality. But things have
changed since then: and now, in the <em>great </em>affairs of economic
life, very little indeed depends on the single personality. Human
economic working has to a very large extent been drawn into what I am
here comparing with the ultra-violet. I refer to the workings of Capital
as such. Accumulations of Capital are active as such. Over and above the
economic, there lies an ultra-economic life, which is essentially
determined by the peculiar power inherent in the actual masses of
Capital. If, therefore, we wish to understand the economic life of
today, we must regard it thus: It lies in the midst between two regions,
of which the one leads downward into Nature and the other upward into
Capital. Between them lies the domain which we must comprehend as the
economic life properly speaking.</p>
<p>Now from this you will see that men did not even possess the
necessary concept to enable them to define the science of Economics and
set it in its proper place within the whole domain of knowledge. For, as
we shall presently see, it is a curious thing: but this region alone
(which we have compared with the infra-red) — this region which does not
yet reach up into the sphere of economics properly speaking — this alone
is intelligible by the human intellect. We can consider, with ordinary
thinking, how to grow oats or barley and so forth: or how best to obtain
the raw products in mining. That is all that we can really think about
with the intellect which we have grown accustomed to apply in the
science of modern time.</p>
<p>This is a fact of immense significance. Think back for a moment to
what I have just indicated as the concept which we need in science. We
consume heavy substances as food. That they can be of use to us, depends
upon the fact that they continually lose weight within us. That is to
say, within the body they are totally transformed. But that is not all.
They are changed in a different way in each organ: it is a different
change in the liver from that in the brain or in the lung. The organism
is differentiated and the conditions are different for each substance in
each single organ. We have a perpetual change of quality along with the
change from organ to organ.</p>
<p>Now, it is approximately the same when, within a given economic
domain, we speak of the value of a commodity. It is nonsense to define
some substance as carbon, for example, and then to ask: How does it
behave inside the human body? The carbon, even as regards its weight,
becomes something altogether different from what it is here or there in
the outer world. Likewise, we cannot simply ask: What is the value of a
commodity? The value is different according as the commodity is lying in
a shop, or is transported to this place or that.</p>
<p>Thus, our ideas in Economics must be altogether mobile. We must rid
ourselves of the habit of constructing concepts capable of definition
once and for all. We must realise that we are dealing with a living
process, and must transform our concepts with the process. But what the
economists have tried to do is to grasp such things as Value, Price,
Production, Consumption and so forth with ideas such as they had in
ordinary science. And these were of no use.</p>
<p>Fundamentally speaking, therefore, we have not yet attained a true
science of Economics. With the concepts to which we have grown
accustomed hitherto, we cannot answer the question, for instance: What
is Value? Or, what is Price? Whatever has Value must be considered as
being in perpetual circulation: like-wise we must consider the Price,
corresponding to a Value, as something in perpetual circulation. If you
simply ask: What are the physical properties of carbon? you will still
know absolutely nothing of what goes on in the lung, for example,
although carbon is also present in the lung. For its whole configuration
becomes quite different in the lung. In the same way, iron, when you
find it in the mine, is something altogether different from what it is
in the economic process. Economics is concerned with something quite
different from the mere fact that it “is” iron. It is with these
unstable, constantly changing factors that we must reckon.</p>
<p>Forty-five years ago, I came into a certain family. They showed me a
picture. I think it had been lying up in a loft for about fifty years.
So long as it lay there, and no one was there who knew any more about it
than that it was the kind of thing one throws away in a corner of the
loft, it had no value in the economic process. Once its value had been
recognised, it was worth 30.000 gulden — quite a large sum of money in
those days. What did the value depend on in this case? Purely and simply
on the opinion men formed of the picture. The picture had not been
removed from its place, only men had arrived at different thoughts about
it. And so in no case does it depend on what a thing immediately “is.”
The conceptions of Economics are the very ones which you can never
evolve by reference to the mere external reality. No, you must always
evolve them by reference to the economic process as a whole: and within
this process each thing is perpetually changing. Therefore we must speak
of the economic process of circulation before we can arrive at such
things as Value, Price and so forth. In the economic theories of today,
you will observe that they generally begin with definitions of Value and
Price. That is quite wrong. The first thing needful is to describe the
economic process. Only then do those things emerge with which the
theorists of today begin.</p>
<p>Now, in the year 1919, when everything had been destroyed, one might
have thought that people would realise the need to begin with something
fresh. Alas, it was not the case. The small number of people who did
believe that there must be a new beginning, very soon fell into the
comfortable reflection: “After all, there is nothing to be done.”
Meanwhile, the great calamity was taking place: the devaluation of money
in the Eastern and Middle countries of Europe, and with it a complete
revolution in the social strata; for it goes without saying that with
each progressive devaluation of money, those who live by what I have
here compared to the ultra-violet must be impoverished. And this is
happening to-day, far more perhaps than people are yet aware. And it
will happen, more and more completely. Here, above all, we are directed
to the idea of the living, social organism. For it is evident that this
devaluation of money is determined by the old State frontiers and
limitations. The old State frontiers and limitations are interfering
with the economic process. The latter must indeed be understood, but we
must first gain an understanding of the social organism. Yet all the
systems of Political Economy — from Adam Smith to the most modern —
reckon, after all, with small isolated regions as if they were complete
social organisms. They do not realise that, even if one is only using an
analogy, the analogy must be correct. Have you ever seen an elaborate or
full-grown organism, such as the human being, for instance, in this
drawing — and immediately beside it a second one, and here a third, and
so forth? (see Diagram 1) They would look quite pretty — these human
organisms, sticking to one another in this way: and yet with elaborate
and full-grown organisms there is no such thing. But with the separate
States and Countries, this is the case. Living organisms require an
empty space around them — empty space between them and other living
organisms. You could at most compare the single States with the cells of
the organism. It is only the whole Earth which, as a body economic, can
truly be compared with a living organism. This ought surely to be taken
into account. It is quite palpable, ever since we have had a
world-economy, that the single States or Countries are at most to be
compared with cells.</p>
<p><img src="steiner-economy-1-2.jpg" class="a" /></p>
<p>The whole Earth, considered as an economic organism, is the social
organism. Yet this is nowhere being taken into account. It is precisely
owing to this error that the whole science of Political Economy has
grown so remote from reality. People will seek to establish principles
that are only to apply to certain individual cells. Hence, if you study
French political economy, you will find it differently constituted from
English or German or other political economies. But as economists, what
we really need is an understanding of the social organism <em>in its
totality.</em></p>
