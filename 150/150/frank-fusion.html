<h1>Nuclear Fusion Won’t Save the Climate</h1>
<h3>But It Might Blow Up the World</h3>
<img class="a" src="atomic-blast.jpeg">
<h2>BY <a href="https://tomdispatch.com/authors/joshuafrank/"><strong>JOSHUA FRANK</strong></a></h2>

<main>
<p class="intro">I awoke on December 13th to news about what could be the most
significant scientific breakthrough since the Food and Drug
Administration authorized the first Covid vaccine for emergency use two
years ago. This time, however, the achievement had nothing to do with
that ongoing public health crisis. Instead, as the <em>New York
Times </em>and CNN alerted me that morning, at stake was a new
technology that could potentially solve the worst dilemma humanity
faces: climate change and the desperate overheating of our planet. <a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-national-laboratory-makes-history-achieving-fusion-ignition"><strong>Net-energy-gain</strong></a> fusion,
a long-sought-after panacea for all that’s wrong with traditional
nuclear-fission energy (read: accidents, radioactive waste), had finally
been achieved at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in
California.</p>
<p>“This is such a wonderful example of a possibility realized, a
scientific milestone achieved, and a road ahead to the possibilities for
clean energy,” <a href="https://www.powermag.com/fusion-breakthrough-brings-cheers-though-challenges-remain/"><strong>exclaimed</strong></a> White
House science adviser Arati Prabhakar.</p>
<p><span id="anchor"></span>The <em>New York Times</em> was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/13/science/nuclear-fusion-energy-breakthrough.html"><strong>quick
to follow</strong></a> Prabhakar’s lead, boasting that fusion is an
“energy source devoid of the pollution and greenhouse gasses caused by
the burning of fossil fuels.” Even Fox News, not exactly at the top of
anyone’s list of places focused on climate change, jumped on the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/science/us-scientists-produce-first-successful-nuclear-fusion-reaction-net-energy-gain"><strong>bandwagon</strong></a>,
declaring fusion “a technology that has the potential to accelerate the
planet’s shift away from fossil fuels and produce nearly limitless,
carbon-free energy.”</p>
<p>All in all, the reviews for fusion were positively glowing and it
seemed to make instant sense. What could possibly be wrong with
something that might end our reliance on fossil fuels, even as it
reduced the risks posed by our <a href="https://thebulletin.org/2019/08/aging-nuclear-plants-industry-cost-cutting-and-reduced-safety-oversight-a-dangerous-mix/"><strong>aging
nuclear industry</strong></a>? The message, repeated again and again in
the days that followed: this was a genuine global-warming
game-changer.</p>
<p>After all, in the fusion process, no atoms have to be split to create
heat. Gigantic lasers are used, not uranium, so there’s no toxic mining
involved, nor do thousands of gallons of cold water have to be pumped in
to cool overheated reactors, nor will there be radioactive waste
byproducts lasting hundreds of thousands of years. <em>And not a risk of
a nuclear meltdown in sight!</em> Fusion, so the cheery news went, is
safe, effective, and efficient!</p>
<p>Or is it?</p>
<p><strong>The Big Catch</strong></p>
<p>On a very basic level, fusion is the <a href="http://butane.chem.uiuc.edu/pshapley/GenChem1/L1/3.html"><strong>stuff
of stars</strong></a>. Within the Earth’s sun, hydrogen combines with
helium to create heat in the form of sunlight. Inside the walls of the
Livermore Lab, this natural process was imitated by blasting 192
gigantic lasers into a tube the size of a baby’s toe. Inside that
cylinder sat a “hydrogen-encased diamond.” When the laser shot through
the small hole, it destroyed that diamond quicker than the blink of an
eye. In doing so, it created a bunch of invisible x-rays that compressed
a small pellet of deuterium and tritium, which scientists refer to as
“heavy hydrogen.”</p>
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1642598283/ref=nosim/?tag=tomdispatch-20">
<div class="polaroid">
<img class="b" src="atomic-days-bc.webp" alt="Atomic Days" style="width:100%">
<div class="container"><p>Buy the Book!</p></div></div></a>
<p>“In a brief moment lasting less than 100 trillionths of a second,
2.05 megajoules of energy — roughly the equivalent of a pound of TNT —
bombarded the hydrogen pellet,”<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/13/science/nuclear-fusion-energy-breakthrough.html"> </a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/13/science/nuclear-fusion-energy-breakthrough.html"><strong>explained</strong></a> <em>New
York Times</em> reporter Kenneth Chang. “Out flowed a flood of neutron
particles — the product of fusion — which carried about 3 megajoules of
energy, a factor of 1.5 in energy gain.”</p>
<p>As with so many breakthroughs, there was a catch. First, 3 megajoules
isn’t much energy. After all, it takes <a href="https://twitter.com/Insulfoam/status/1408515554470764544/photo/1"><strong>360,000
megajoules</strong></a> to create 300 hours of light from a single
100-watt light bulb. So, Livermore’s fusion development isn’t going to
electrify a single home, let alone a million homes, anytime soon. And
there was another nagging issue with this little fusion creation as
well: it took 300 megajoules to power up those 192 lasers. Simply put,
at the moment, they require 100 times <em>more</em> energy to charge
than the energy they ended up producing.</p>
<p>“The reality is that fusion energy will not be viable at scale
anytime within the next decade, a time frame over which carbon emissions
must be reduced by 50% to avoid catastrophic warming of more than
1.5°C,”<a href="https://news.yahoo.com/why-the-nuclear-fusion-breakthrough-wont-prevent-catastrophic-climate-change-202616499.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKotEOrS9Ug45vlAJibQg7zVDMWiW7-6Xv9zabxaRMH0Ty0fJBo72ksZf4YldQunHwa0dVuuhVvzNHfNEtFdtcfzoSqFs87x5fn6NwhyVlGOObkV_kuAQEzaqi4MHvDPy4vclPUuoDfkf34McCTI9Cxc-EvpuZT9_4p6XwWAZYPj"> </a><a href="https://news.yahoo.com/why-the-nuclear-fusion-breakthrough-wont-prevent-catastrophic-climate-change-202616499.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKotEOrS9Ug45vlAJibQg7zVDMWiW7-6Xv9zabxaRMH0Ty0fJBo72ksZf4YldQunHwa0dVuuhVvzNHfNEtFdtcfzoSqFs87x5fn6NwhyVlGOObkV_kuAQEzaqi4MHvDPy4vclPUuoDfkf34McCTI9Cxc-EvpuZT9_4p6XwWAZYPj"><strong>says</strong></a> climate
expert Michael Mann, a professor of earth and environmental science at
the University of Pennsylvania. “That task will only be achievable
through the scaling up of existing clean energy — renewable sources such
as wind and solar — along with energy storage capability and efficiency
and conservation measures.”</p>
<p><strong>Tritium Trials and Tribulations</strong></p>
<p>The secretive and heavily secured <a href="https://www.llnl.gov/news/national-ignition-facility-achieves-fusion-ignition"><strong>National
Ignition Facility</strong></a> where that test took place is the size of
a sprawling sports arena. It could, in fact, hold three football fields.
Which makes me wonder: how much space would be needed to do fusion on a
commercial scale? No good answer is yet available. Then there’s the
trouble with that isotope tritium needed to help along the fusion
reaction. It’s not easy to come by and costs about as much as diamonds,
around $30,000 per gram. Right now, even some of the bigwigs at the
Department of Defense <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/opinion/commentary/2017/03/06/commentary-the-looming-crisis-for-us-tritium-production/"><strong>are
worried</strong></a> that we’re running out of usable tritium.  </p>
<p>“Fusion advocates often boast that the fuel for their reactors will
be cheap and plentiful. That is certainly true for deuterium,”<a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/fusion-power-may-run-fuel-even-gets-started"> </a><a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/fusion-power-may-run-fuel-even-gets-started"><strong>writes</strong></a> Daniel
Clery in <em>Science</em>. “Roughly one in every 5,000 hydrogen atoms in
the oceans is deuterium, and it sells for about $13 per gram. But
tritium, with a half-life of 12.3 years, exists naturally only in trace
amounts in the upper atmosphere, the product of cosmic ray
bombardment.”</p>
<p>Fusion boosters brush this unwelcome fact aside, pointing out that
“tritium breeding” — a process in which tritium is endlessly produced in
a loop-like fashion — is entirely possible in a fully operating fusion
reactor. In theory, this may seem plausible, but you need a bunch of
tritium to jumpstart the initial chain reaction and doubt abounds that
there’s enough of it out there to begin with. On top of that, the
reactors themselves will have to be lined with a lot of lithium, itself
an expensive chemical element at <a href="https://www.dailymetalprice.com/metalpricecharts.php?c=li&amp;u=kg&amp;d=240"><strong>$71
a kilogram</strong></a> (copper, by contrast, is around $9.44 a
kilogram), to allow the process to work correctly.</p>
<p>Then there’s also a commonly repeated misstatement that fusion
doesn’t create significant radioactive waste, a haunting reality for the
world’s current fleet of nuclear plants. True, plutonium, which can be
used as fuel in atomic weapons, isn’t a natural byproduct of fusion, but
tritium is the <em>radioactive</em> form of hydrogen. Its little
isotopes are great at permeating metals and finding ways to escape tight
enclosures. Obviously, this will pose a significant problem for those
who want to continuously breed tritium in a fusion reactor. It also
presents a concern for people worried about radioactivity making its way
out of such facilities and into the environment.</p>
<p>“Cancer is the main risk from humans ingesting tritium. When tritium
decays it spits out a low-energy electron (roughly 18,000 electron
volts) that escapes and slams into DNA, a ribosome, or some other
biologically important molecule,” David Biello <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-radioactive-hydrogen-in-drinking-water-a-cancer-threat/"><strong>explains</strong></a> in <em>Scientific
American</em>. “And, unlike other radionuclides, tritium is usually part
of water, so it ends up in all parts of the body and therefore can, in
theory, promote any kind of cancer. But that also helps reduce the risk:
any tritiated water is typically excreted in less than a month.”</p>
<p>If that sounds problematic, that’s because it is. This country’s
above-ground atomic bomb testing in the 1950s and 1960s was responsible
for most of the man-made tritium that’s lingering in the environment.
And it will be at least 2046, 84 years after the last American
atmospheric nuclear detonation in Nevada, before tritium there will no
longer pose a problem for the area.</p>
<p>Of course, tritium also escapes from our existing nuclear reactors
and is <a href="https://www.ap.org/press-releases/2012/part-ii-ap-impact-tritium-leaks-found-at-many-nuke-sites"><strong>routinely
found</strong></a> near such facilities where it occurs “<a href="https://www.nrc.gov/reactors/operating/ops-experience/tritium/faqs.html"><strong>naturally</strong></a>”
during the fission process. In fact, after Illinois farmers discovered
their wells had been contaminated by the nearby Braidwood nuclear plant,
they successfully sued the site’s operator Exelon, which, in 2005, was
caught discharging<a href="https://cen.acs.org/articles/84/i26/Radioactive-Leaks-Found-Reactors.html"> </a><a href="https://cen.acs.org/articles/84/i26/Radioactive-Leaks-Found-Reactors.html"><strong>6.2
million gallons</strong></a> of tritium-laden water into the soil.</p>
<p>In the United States, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) allows
the industry to monitor for tritium releases at nuclear sites; the
industry is politely asked to alert the NRC in a “timely manner” if
tritium is either intentionally or accidentally released. But a <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/a319325.html"><strong>June 2011
report</strong></a> issued by the Government Accountability Office cast
doubt on the NRC’s archaic system for assessing tritium discharges,
suggesting that it’s anything but effective. (“Absent such an
assessment, we continue to believe that NRC has no assurance that the
Groundwater Protection Initiative will lead to prompt detection of
underground piping system leaks as nuclear power plants age.”) </p>
<p>Consider all of this a way of saying that, if the NRC isn’t doing an
adequate job of monitoring tritium leaks already occurring with
regularity at the country’s nuclear plants, how the heck will it do a
better job of tracking the stuff at fusion plants in the future? And as
I suggest in my new book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1642598283/ref=nosim/?tag=tomdispatch-20"><strong><em>Atomic
Days: The Untold Story of the Most Toxic Place in
America</em></strong></a>, the NRC is plain awful at just about
everything it does.</p>
<p><strong>Instruments of Death</strong></p>
<p>All of that got me wondering: if tritium, vital for the fusion
process, is radioactive, and if they aren’t going to be operating those
lasers in time to put the brakes on climate change, what’s really going
on here?</p>
<p>Maybe some clues lie (as is so often the case) in history. The
initial idea for a fusion reaction was proposed by English physicist
Arthur Eddington in 1920. More than 30 years later, on November 1, 1952,
the first full-scale U.S. test of a thermonuclear device, “Operation
Ivy,” took place in the Marshall Islands in the Pacific Ocean. It
yielded a mushroom-cloud explosion from a fusion reaction equivalent in
its power to 10.4 Megatons of TNT. That was 450 times more powerful than
the atomic bomb the U.S. had dropped on the Japanese city of Nagasaki
only seven years earlier to end World War II. It created an underwater
crater 6,240 feet wide and 164 feet deep.</p>
<p>“The Shot, as witnessed aboard the various vessels at sea, is not
easily described,” noted a <a href="https://time.com/4096424/ivy-mike-history/"><strong>military
report</strong></a> on that nuclear experiment. “Accompanied by a
brilliant light, the heat wave was felt immediately at distances of
thirty to thirty-five miles. The tremendous fireball, appearing on the
horizon like the sun when half-risen, quickly expanded after a momentary
hover time.”</p>
<p>Nicknamed “Ivy Mike,” the bomb was a Teller-Ulam thermonuclear
device, named after its creators Edward Teller and Stanislaw Ulam. It
was also the United States’ first full-scale hydrogen bomb, an
altogether different beast than the two awful nukes dropped on Japan in
August 1945. Those bombs utilized fission in their cores to create
massive explosions. But Ivy Mike gave a little insight into what was
still possible for future weapons of annihilation.</p>
<p>The details of how the Teller-Ulam device works are still classified,
but historian of science Alex Wellerstein <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/a-hydrogen-bomb-by-any-other-name"><strong>explained
the concept</strong></a> well in the <em>New Yorker</em>:</p>
<p>“The basic idea is, as far as we know, as follows. Take a fission
weapon — call it the primary. Take a capsule of fusionable material,
cover it with depleted uranium, and call it the secondary. Take both the
primary and the secondary and put them inside a radiation case — a box
made of very heavy materials. When the primary detonates, radiation
flows out of it, filling the case with X rays. This process, which is
known as radiation implosion, will, through one mechanism or another…
compress the secondary to very high densities, inaugurating fusion
reactions on a large scale. These fusion reactions will, in turn, let
off neutrons of such a high energy that they can make the normally inert
depleted uranium of the secondary’s casing undergo fission.”</p>
<p>Got it? Ivy Mike was, in fact, a <em>fission</em> explosion that <a href="https://blog.ucsusa.org/dylan-spaulding/what-does-a-nuclear-fusion-breakthrough-mean-for-energy-production-and-nuclear-weapons/"><strong>initiated
a </strong></a><a href="https://blog.ucsusa.org/dylan-spaulding/what-does-a-nuclear-fusion-breakthrough-mean-for-energy-production-and-nuclear-weapons/"><strong><em>fusion</em></strong></a><a href="https://blog.ucsusa.org/dylan-spaulding/what-does-a-nuclear-fusion-breakthrough-mean-for-energy-production-and-nuclear-weapons/"><strong> reaction</strong></a>.
But ultimately, the science of how those instruments of death work isn’t
all that important. The takeaway here is that, since first tried out in
that monstrous Marshall Islands explosion, fusion has been intended as a
tool of war. And sadly, so it remains, despite all the publicity about
its possible use some distant day in relation to climate change. In
truth, any fusion breakthroughs are potentially of critical importance
not as a remedy for our warming climate but for a future apocalyptic
world of war. Despite all the fantastic media publicity, that’s how the
U.S. government has always seen it and that’s why the latest fusion test
to create “energy” was executed in the utmost secrecy at the Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory. One thing should be taken for granted:
the American government is interested not in using fusion technology to
power the energy grid, but in using it to further <a href="https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/6412035"><strong>strengthen</strong></a> this
country’s already <a href="https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Fact-Sheet_Unclass_2021_final-v2-002.pdf"><strong>massive
arsenal</strong></a> of atomic weapons.</p>
<p>Consider it an irony, under the circumstances, but in its
announcement about the success at Livermore — though this obviously
wasn’t what made the headlines — the Department of Energy didn’t skirt
around the issue of gains for future atomic weaponry. Jill Hruby, the
department’s undersecretary for nuclear security, admitted that, in
achieving a fusion ignition, researchers had “opened a new chapter in
NNSA’s science-based Stockpile Stewardship Program.” (NNSA stands for
the National Nuclear Security Administration.) That “chapter” Hruby was
bragging about has a lot more to do with “<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/nuclear-modernization-plans-are-unnecessarily-costly-and-risky-2021-7"><strong>modernizing</strong></a>”
the country’s nuclear weapons capabilities than with using laser fusion
to end our reliance on fossil fuels.</p>
<p>“Had we not pursued the hydrogen bomb,” Edward Teller once said,
“there is a very real threat that we would now all be speaking Russian.
I have no regrets.” Some attitudes die hard.</p>
<p>Buried deep in the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory’s website,
the government comes clean about what these fusion experiments at the <a href="https://physicstoday.scitation.org/do/10.1063/pt.6.2.20210817a/full/"><strong>$3.5
billion</strong></a> National Ignition Facility (NIF) are <a href="https://lasers.llnl.gov/science/nif-and-stockpile-stewardship"><strong>really
all about</strong></a>:</p>
<p>“NIF’s high energy density and inertial confinement fusion
experiments, coupled with the increasingly sophisticated simulations
available from some of the world’s most powerful supercomputers,
increase our understanding of weapon physics, including the properties
and survivability of weapons-relevant materials… The high rigor and
multidisciplinary nature of NIF experiments play a key role in
attracting, training, testing, and retaining new generations of skilled
stockpile stewards who will continue the mission to protect America into
the future.”</p>
<p>Yes, despite all the media attention to climate change, this is a
rare yet intentional admission, surely meant to frighten officials in
China and Russia. It leaves little doubt about what this fusion
breakthrough means. It’s not about creating future clean energy and
never has been. It’s about “protecting” the world’s greatest capitalist
superpower. Competitors beware.</p>
<p>Sadly, fusion won’t save the Arctic from melting, but if we don’t put
a stop to it, that breakthrough technology could someday melt us
all.</p>
