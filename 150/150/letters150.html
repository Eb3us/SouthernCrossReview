<p>RE: <a href="https://southerncrossreview.org/141/hemsley-breathe.html">Breathe</a></p>
<p>I absolutely love this piece of poetry. Recently, having a very hard
time with a ridiculously troublesome divorce, this makes so much sense
to me, It's sad. Marybeth Fletcher</p>
<p style="text-align:center">* * *</p>
<p>I too like to think that I am a poet but of course only others may
say that. You, however, I am glad and encouraged by heart to speak the
truth to say, are a poet. </p>
<p>This is the first time I have read "Breathe" and I am enchanted by
it. Thank you for your effort and for allowing me the privilege of
having the great honor of the enlightenment it brings to me.</p>

<p>I just listened to a podcast from Meghan Markle's "Archetypes" series
and she concluded by reading Becky Hemsley's poem "Breathe" (<a

... wow !! ;-D</p>
<p>I'm a bit lost for words in the wake of this poem but want to send
this "fan girl" email to say thanx !! ;-D</p>
<p>Gratefully &amp; Semi-Breathlessly,</p>

<p>I absolutely totally loved this poem, although on the whole I don’t
do terribly well with poetry. It mostly goes right over my head! But
please please correct it’s to its in your review!!!! “and it’s
consistencies with human emotion. ”</p>
<p>Bad form.  I look forward to reading more. </p>
<p>Best,</p>

<p>RE: <a href="https://southerncrossreview.org/150/gordon-exceptional.html">American
Exceptionalism on Full Display</a></p>
<p>I would like this article printed on everyone's front page computer,
on their minds along with a hard slap on their cheeks! Such ignorance,
stupidity, and other words I can't remember at the moment having to do
with so many other shortcomings of the amerrikkkan mentality. They buy
the pap, the fairy tale, the lies and propaganda and revel in the myths
of what is going on in this selfish place. Despite spending all kinds of
money on military expansion, ughhhhh!!!! There's no point in even
repeating all of that. I completely agree with Gordon! And , by the way,
Rochester has one of the highest rates of child poverty in the country!
It has one of the worst public school systems and a high murder rate.
It's also interesting to note that there is so little anger towards the
system from people who suffer most. That's enough. Just one thing, it is
so difficult to get this truth out to the world, or even to the people
who could learn something about it in this country!</p>

<p>RE: <a href="https://southerncrossreview.org/9/hologram.htm">The Universe
as Hologram</a></p>
<p>That was a terrific article and, as a social commentator, has opened
my mind beyond anything I have previously experienced.</p>
<p>What immediately jumped into my mind was that we all have different
perceptions of the same thing, be it theory or ‘solid’ state and is yet
another aspect of our interconnectedness and life as a holograph.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for placing this information in an arena where
non-scientists such as myself can learn. A fabulous start to 2023.</p>
<p>Kindest.</p>
