### Lecture One of Fourteen - The Johannine Christians

Translated by Samuel and Loni Lockwood\
June 24, 1909, Kassel, Germany -- GA112

My dear Friends:\
A special festival has long been celebrated on this particular day of
the year by a great number of those seeking higher wisdom; and many
friends of our anthroposophical movement here in this city have wished
this series of lectures to commence on this day, St. John\'s Day.

The day of the year bearing this name was a festival as far back as the
time of ancient Persia. There, on a day corresponding to a June day as
we know it, the so-called Festival of the Baptism by Water and Fire was
celebrated. In ancient Rome the Festival of Vesta was held on a similar
day in June, and that again was a festival of baptism by fire. Going
back to the time of pre-Christian culture in Europe and including the
period before Christianity had become widely disseminated, we find a
similar June festival coinciding with the time when the days are longest
and the nights shortest, when the days start to become shorter again,
when the sun once more begins to lose some of the power that provides
for all earthly growth and thriving. This June festival seemed to our
European forefathers like a retrogression, a gradual evanescence, of the
God Baldur who was thought of as associated with the sun. Then in
Christian times this June festival gradually became the Festival of St.
John in memory of the Forerunner of the Christ Jesus. In this way it can
form the starting point, as it were, for our discussions during the
coming days of that most significant event in human evolution which we
call the deed of the Christ Jesus. This deed, its whole significance for
the development of mankind, the way it is revealed primarily in the most
important Christian document, the Gospel of St. John --- and then a
comparison of this with the other Gospels --- a study of all this will
form the subject of this lecture cycle.

St. John\'s Day reminds us that the most exalted Individuality that ever
took part in the evolution of mankind was preceded by a forerunner. This
touches at once an important point which --- again like a forerunner ---
we must place at the beginning of our lectures as a subject of
discussion. In the course of human evolution there appear again and
again events of such profound import as to throw a stronger light than
others. From epoch to epoch we see history recording such vital events;
and ever and anon we are told that there are people who, in certain
respects, know of such events in advance and can foretell them. This
implies that such events are not arbitrary, but rather that one who
discerns the whole sense and spirit of human history knows how such
events must unfold, and how he himself must work and prepare in order
that they may come to pass.

We shall have occasion in the next few days to refer repeatedly to the
Forerunner of the Christ Jesus. Today we will consider him only as one
of those who, by means of special spiritual gifts, are able to see deep
into the relations within the evolution of mankind, and who thus know
that there are pre-eminent moments in this evolution. For this reason he
was able to clear the path for the Christ Jesus. But if we turn to
Christ Jesus Himself, thus coming to the main subject of our
discussions, we must understand that not without reason does a large
part of mankind divide the record of time into two epochs separated by
the appearance of Christ Jesus on earth. This discloses a feeling for
the incisive importance of the Christ Mystery. But all truth, all
reality, must ever be proclaimed to humanity in new forms, in new ways,
for the needs of men change from one epoch to another. In certain
respects our epoch calls for a new revelation even of this greatest
event in the earthly evolution of man, the Christ Event; and it is
anthroposophy\'s aim to be this revelation.

As far as its content is concerned, the anthroposophical presentation of
the Christ Mystery is nothing new, not even for us today; but its form
is new. All that is to be disclosed here in the next few days has been
known for centuries within certain restricted circles of our cultural
and spiritual life. Only one feature distinguishes today\'s presentation
from all those that have gone before: it can be addressed to a larger
circle. Those smaller circles in which for centuries the same message
was proclaimed within our European spiritual life, these had recognized
the same symbol that confronts you here in this lecture hall today: the
Rose Cross. For this reason it is fitting that today, when this message
goes forth to a larger public, the Rose Cross should again be its
symbol.

First let me characterize once more in a symbolical way the basis of
these Rosicrucian revelations concerning the Christ Jesus. The
Rosicrucians are a brotherhood that has fostered a genuinely spiritual
Christianity within the spiritual life of Europe ever since the 14th
Century. This Rosicrucian Society which, ignoring all outer historical
forms, has endeavored to bring to light the deepest truths of
Christianity, always called its members "Christians of St. John." If we
come to understand this term the whole spirit and trend of the following
lectures will be at least imaginatively grasped.

As you know, the Gospel of St. John --- that mighty document of the
human race --- begins with the words:

In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and a God was
the Word. The same was in the beginning with God.

The Word, then --- or the Logos --- was in the beginning with God. And
we are further told that the light shone in the darkness, and that the
darkness at first comprehended it not; that this light was in the world
among men, but that these men counted but few among their number who
were able to comprehend the Light. Then the Word made flesh appeared as
a man, a man whose forerunner was the Baptist John. And then we see how
those who had some understanding of this appearance of Christ on earth
endeavored to make clear what Christ really was. We see the author of
the John Gospel pointing directly to the fact that what dwelt in Jesus
of Nazareth as profoundest essence was nothing different from that in
which originate all other beings that surround us: the living Spirit,
the living Word, the Logos itself.

And the other Evangelists as well, each in his own way, have been at
pains to characterize what it really was that appeared in Jesus of
Nazareth. We see, for example, the writer of the Luke Gospel endeavoring
to show that something quite special manifested itself when, at the
Baptism of Christ Jesus, the Spirit united with the body of Jesus of
Nazareth. Then the same writer tells us that this Jesus of Nazareth was
the descendant of ancestors reaching far, far back; that His genealogy
went back to David, to Abraham, to Adam --- even to God Himself. Note
well that the Luke Gospel points emphatically to this line of descent:

Jesus of Nazareth was the son of Joseph, Joseph was the son of Heli.

then:

..*. he was the son of David* \...

and finally:

he was the son of Adam, and Adam was the son of God.

This means that the author of the Luke Gospel considers it of special
importance that a direct line runs from Jesus of Nazareth, with Whom the
Spirit united at the Baptism by John, to Him Whom he calls the Father of
Adam, to God. Such things must be taken entirely literally.

In the Matthew Gospel, on the other hand, the attempt is made to trace
the descent of this Jesus of Nazareth back to Abraham, to whom God
revealed Himself.

In this way and in many others --- through many statements we can find
in the Gospels --- the Individuality that is the vehicle of the Christ,
as well as the whole manifestation of Christ, is set before us not only
as one of the greatest, but as the very greatest of all events in the
evolution of humanity. Clearly this means, does it not, what can be
expressed quite simply as follows: If Christ Jesus is regarded by those
who divined something of His greatness as the most significant
phenomenon in the evolution of man upon earth, then this Christ Jesus
must in some way be connected with what is most vital and sacred in man
himself. In other words, there must be something in man himself that can
be brought into relation with the Christ event. Can we not ask, If
Christ Jesus, as the Gospels maintain, is really the most important
phenomenon in human evolution, does it not follow that always, in every
human soul, there is something that is related to Christ Jesus?

And that is precisely what the Johannine Christians of the Rosicrucian
Society deemed of greatest import and significance: that there is in
every human soul something directly related to the events in Palestine
as brought about through Christ Jesus. If the coming of Christ Jesus can
be called the greatest event for mankind, then what corresponds in the
human soul to the Christ event must be the greatest and most significant
as well. And what can that be? The disciples of the Rosicrucians
answered: There exists for every human soul something that is called
*awakening*, or *rebirth*, or *initiation*.

Let us see what is meant by these terms. Looking at the various things
around us --- things we see with our eyes, touch with our hands --- we
observe them coming into being and perishing. We see the flower, the
whole annual plant life, come up and then wither; and though there are
such things in the world as rocks and mountains that seem to defy the
centuries we need only consider the proverb, \"a steady drip hollows out
the rock\" to realize that the human soul senses the laws of transience
as governing even the majestic boulders and mountains. And we know that
there comes into being and perishes even what is built of the elements:
not only what we call our corporeality, but what we know as our
perishable "I" is engendered and then passes. But those who know how a
spiritual world can be reached know also that this is not attained by
means of eyes or ears or other senses, but by the path of awakening, of
rebirth, of initiation.

And what is it that is reborn? When a man observes his inner self he
finally comes to realize that what he sees there is that to which he
says "I". Its very name differentiates it from anything in the outer
world. To everything in the outer world a name can be applied
externally. Everyone can call a table a table or a clock a clock; but
never could the we hear "I" if it were intended to mean our self, for
"I" must be spoken within us: to everyone else we are "you." This in
itself shows us that our I-being is distinct from all else that is in or
around us.

But in addition, we now come to something that spiritual scientists of
all times have emphasized from their own experience for the benefit of
mankind: that within this I another, a higher one, is born, as the child
is born of the mother. A man as he appears in life is first encountered
as a child, awkward in his surroundings but gradually learning to
understand things: he gains in sense, his intellect and his will grow,
and his strength and energy increase. But there have always been people
who grow in other ways as well, who attain to a stage of development
beyond the average, who find, so to say, a second I that can say "you"
to the first one in the same way that the I itself says "you" to the
outer world and to its own body --- that looks upon this first I from
above, as it were.

As an ideal, then, for the soul of man, and as a reality for those who
follow the instructions of spiritual science, we have the thought: the
"I" that I have hitherto known takes part in the whole outer world, and
together with this it is perishable; but there slumbers within me a
second I of which men are unaware but can become aware. It is linked
with the imperishable, just as the first I is bound up with the
perishable, the temporal; and by means of rebirth this higher I can
behold a spiritual world just as the lower I perceives the physical
world through eyes and ears.

This awakening, rebirth, initiation, as it is called, is the greatest
event for the human soul --- a view shared by those who called
themselves confessors of the Rose Cross. They knew that this event of
the rebirth of the higher I, which can look from above on the lower I as
man looks on outer forms, must have some connection with the event of
Christ Jesus. This means that just as a rebirth can occur for the
individual in his development, so a rebirth for all humanity came about
through Christ Jesus. That which is an inner event for the individual
--- a mystical-spiritual event, as it is called, something he can
experience as the birth of his higher I --- corresponds to what occurred
in the outer world, in history, for all mankind in the event of
Palestine through Christ Jesus.

How did this appear to a man like, for instance, the author of the Luke
Gospel? He reasoned as follows: The genealogy of Jesus of Nazareth goes
back to Adam and to God himself. What today is mankind, what now
inhabits a physical human body, once descended from divine heights: it
was born of the spirit, it was once with God. Adam was he who had been
sent down out of spiritual heights into matter, and in this sense he is
the son of God. So there was at one time a divine-spiritual realm ---
thus the argument would continue --- that condensed, as it were, into an
ephemeral, tellurian realm: Adam came into being. Adam was an earthly
image of the Son of God, and from him are descended the human beings
that dwell in a physical body. And in a special way there lived in Jesus
of Nazareth not only what exists in every person and all that pertains
to it, but something the essence of which can be found only when one is
aware that the true being of man derives from the divine. In Jesus of
Nazareth something of this divine descent is still apparent. For this
reason the writer of the Luke Gospel feels constrained to say, Behold
Him Who was baptized by John! He bears special marks of the divine out
of which Adam was originally born. This can come to life again in him.
Just as the God descended into matter and disappeared as such from the
human race, so he reappears. In Jesus of Nazareth mankind could be
reborn in its innermost divine principle. What the author of the Luke
Gospel meant was this: If we trace the genealogy of Jesus of Nazareth to
its source, we find the divine origin and the characteristics of the Son
of God appearing in him in a new way, and in a higher degree than would
hitherto have been possible for mankind.

And the writer of the John Gospel emphasizes even more strongly the
existence of something divine in man, as well as the fact that this
appeared in its most grandiose form as the God and the *Logos*
themselves. The God Who had been buried, as it were, in matter is reborn
as a God in Jesus of Nazareth. That is what was meant by those who
introduced their Gospels in this way.

And those who endeavored to perpetuate the wisdom of these Gospels ---
what did they say? How did the Johannine Christians put it? They said:
In the individual human being a great and mighty event can take place
that can be called the rebirth of the higher I. As the child is born of
the mother, so the divine I is born of man. Initiation, awakening, is
possible; and when once this has come to pass --- so said those who were
competent to speak --- a new standard of values will arise.

Let us try to understand by a comparison what it is that henceforth
becomes important. Suppose we have before us a man seventy years old ---
an \"awakened\" man who has attained to his higher I --- and suppose he
had been in his fortieth year when he experienced rebirth, the awakening
of his higher I. Had someone approached him at that time with the
intention of describing his life he could have reflected: I have before
me a man who has just given birth to his higher I. It is the same man I
knew five years ago in certain circumstances, and ten years ago in
others. --- And if he had wanted to portray the identity of this man ---
if he had wanted to show that this man had a quite special start, even
at birth --- he would trace back the forty years with his physical
existence in mind and describe the latter as far as pertinent, in the
spirit of one who sees matters from the spiritual-scientific viewpoint.
But in his fortieth year a higher I was born in this man, and henceforth
this higher I irradiates all the circumstances of his life. He is a new
man. That which existed previously is of no further importance. What is
now important is to understand, above all things, how the higher I grows
from year to year and develops further. Now, when this man had arrived
at the age of seventy, we would enquire into the path taken by the
higher I from the fortieth to the seventieth year; and if we believe in
what was born in the soul of this man thirty years before, it would be
of importance that it is the true spiritual I he presents to us in his
seventieth year. That is the way the Evangelists went about it; and it
was thus, and in connection with the Gospels, that the Johannine
Christians of Rosicrucianism dealt with the Being we know as the Christ
Jesus.

The Gospel writers had set themselves the task of showing, first of all,
that the Christ Jesus had His origin in the primordial World Spirit, in
the God Himself. The God that had dwelt unseen in all mankind is
specifically manifested in Christ Jesus; and that is the same God of
Whom the John Gospel tells us that He was in the beginning. What the
Evangelists set out to do was to show that it was precisely this God
that dwelt in Jesus of Nazareth. But those whose task it was to
perpetuate the eternal wisdom right into our own time had to emphasize
the fact that man\'s higher I, the divine spirit of mankind --- born in
Jesus of Nazareth through the event in Palestine --- had remained the
same and had been preserved by all who approached it with true
understanding. Just as in our comparison we described how the man bore
his higher I in his fortieth year, so the Evangelists pictured the God
that dwells in man up to the event of Palestine --- how the God
developed, how he was reborn, and so forth. But those upon whom it was
incumbent to demonstrate that they were the successors of the
Evangelists, these had to point out that the time was ripe for the
rebirth of the higher I, when we have to do only with the spiritual
part, irradiating\
all else.

Those who called themselves the Johannine Christians and whose symbol
was the Rose Cross held that precisely what was reborn for mankind as
the secret of its higher I has been preserved --- preserved by the close
community which grew out of Rosicrucianism. This continuity is
symbolically indicated by that sacred vessel from which Christ Jesus ate
and drank with His disciples, and in which Joseph of Arimathia caught
the blood that flowed from the wound --- the Holy Grail which, as the
story is told, was brought to Europe by Angels. A temple was built to
contain this vessel, and the Rosicrucians became the guardians of what
it contained, namely, the essence of the reborn God.

The mystery of the reborn God had its being in humanity. It is the
Mystery of the Grail, a mystery propounded like a new Gospel,
proclaiming: We look up to a sage such as the writer of the John Gospel
who was able to say:

In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and a God was
the Word.

That which was with God in the beginning was born again in Him whom we
have seen suffer and die on Golgotha, and who is arisen. --- This
continuity throughout all time of the divine principle and its rebirth,
that is what the author of the John Gospel aimed to set forth. Something
known to all those who endeavored to proclaim this truth was that what
was in the beginning has been preserved. In the beginning was the
mystery of the higher I; it was preserved in the Grail; with the Grail
it has remained linked. And in the Grail lives the I united with the
eternal and immortal, just as the lower I is bound to the ephemeral and
mortal. He who knows the secret of the Holy Grail knows that from the
wood of the Cross there springs ever new life, the immortal I,
symbolized by the roses on the black wood of the cross.

The secret of the Rose Cross can thus appear like a continuation of the
John Gospel; and in reference to the latter and to its continuation it
can truly be said:

I*n the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and a God was
the Word. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made
by It; and without It was not any thing made that was made. In It was
life; and the life was the light of men. And the light shineth in the
darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.*

Only a few people --- those who possessed something of what is not born
of the flesh --- comprehended the light that shone in the darkness. But
then the light became flesh and dwelt among men in the form of Jesus of
Nazareth. Here we can say, wholly within the meaning of the John Gospel:
That which dwelt as the Christ in Jesus of Nazareth was the higher
divine I of all humanity, of the reborn God Who, in Adam, as His image,
became earthly. This reborn human I was perpetuated as a holy secret,
was preserved under the symbol of the Rose Cross, and is now proclaimed
as the secret of the Holy Grail, as the Rose Cross.

The principle which can be born in every human soul as the higher I
points to the rebirth of the divine I, in the evolution of mankind in
its entirety, through the Event of Palestine. Just as the higher I is
born in the individual, so the higher I of all mankind, the divine I,
was born in Palestine; and it is preserved and developed in what lives
concealed in the sign of the Rose Cross.

But if we study the evolution of man we find not only this one great
event, the rebirth of the higher I, but a number of lesser ones as well.
Before the higher I can be born, before this mighty, comprehensive,
pervasive experience can come to the soul --- the birth of the immortal
I in the mortal I --- extensive preparatory stages must have been passed
through. A man must prepare himself in many different ways. And after
the great experience has come to him that enables him to say to himself,
*Now I feel within myself something that looks down from above on my
ordinary I, just as my ordinary I looks upon the things of the senses;
now I am a second being within my first; now I have attained to the
realms in which I am united with the divine beings* --- when the human
being has had this experience, then he faces further stages that must be
passed through, stages differing in their nature from the preparatory
ones, but which none the less must be traversed.

Thus there is for each individual the one great incisive event, the
birth of the higher I; and there is a similar birth as well for the
whole of mankind: the rebirth of the divine I. Also, there are stages
leading to this incisive event and others that must follow it. To find
the former, we look back in time beyond the Christ event. There we
encounter other great manifestations in human evolution. We become aware
of the gradual approach of the Gospel of Christ, as indicated by the
writer of the Luke Gospel when he says, In the beginning there was a
God, a spirit-being in spiritual heights. He descended into the material
world and became man, became humanity. --- True, one could discern in
man, as he developed, his origin in the God, but the God Himself could
not be perceived by observing human evolution with outer physical eyes
alone. He was behind the earthly-physical world, as it were; and there
He was seen by those who understood where He was, by those who could
behold His kingdom.

Let us turn back for a moment to the first civilization that followed
upon a great catastrophe, to the ancient Indian civilization. There we
find seven great and holy teachers known as the Holy Rishis. They
pointed upwards to a higher being of whom they said, Our wisdom can
divine the existence of this being, but it suffices not to perceive it.
--- The vision of the Holy Rishis was great, but the exalted being they
called Vishva Karman was beyond their sphere. Vishva Karman, though
permeating the spiritual world, was a being beyond what the clairvoyant
human eye of that time could reach. --- Then followed the civilization
called after its great leader, Zarathustra, and Zarathustra spoke as
follows to those whom it was his mission to guide: When the clairvoyant
eye contemplates the things of this world --- minerals, plants, animals,
men --- it perceives behind these things all sorts of spiritual beings.
The being, however, to whom man is indebted for his very existence, who
in the future is destined to dwell in man\'s deepest self, remains
hidden as yet even from the clairvoyant eye when it contemplates the
things of this earth. But by raising the clairvoyant eye to the sun,
said Zarathustra, more than the sun is seen: as an aura is perceived
surrounding man, so, in contemplating the sun, the great sun aura is
discerned --- Ahura Mazdao. --- And it was the great sun aura that once
brought forth man, in a manner to be characterized later. Man is the
image of the sun spirit, of Ahura Mazdao; but as yet Ahura Mazdao did
not dwell on earth. --- Then came the time in which clairvoyant people
began to see Ahura Mazdao in what surrounded them on earth. The great
moment had arrived when something could take place that had not been
possible in Zarathustra\'s time. When Zarathustra discerned
clairvoyantly what was manifested in earthly lightning and thunder, it
was not Ahura Mazdao, the great sun spirit who is the prototype of
mankind, that he saw; but when he turned to the sun he saw Ahura Mazdao.
When Zarathustra had found a successor in Moses, Moses\' clairvoyant
vision could see in the burning bush and in the fire on Sinai the spirit
who proclaimed himself as *ehjeh asher ehjeh*, as the "I am," as He Who
was, as He Who is, as He Who shall be: *Jahve*, or *Jehova*.

What had taken place? During that remote period between the appearance
of Zarathustra and that of Moses upon earth, the Spirit Who previously
had dwelt only on the sun had moved downward to earth. He flamed up in
the burning bush and shone in the fire on Sinai: He was in the elements
of the earth. And then another period passed; and the Spirit whose
presence the great holy Rishis felt, but of whom they had to say: Our
clairvoyance does not suffice to see Him --- the Spirit whom Zarathustra
had to seek in the sun, who revealed Himself to Moses in thunder and
lightning --- this Spirit appeared in a human being: in Jesus of
Nazareth. That was the evolution: first a descent from the cosmos into
the physical elements, then into a human body. Only then was reborn the
divine I from which man descended, and to which the writer of the Luke
Gospel traces the genealogy of Jesus of Nazareth. This was the great
event of the rebirth of the God in man.

That is a retrospect of the preparatory stages, and it shows us that
mankind, too, passed through these. And those who had advanced with
mankind as its early leaders were also destined to progress until one of
them had achieved the capacity to become the bearer of the Christ. Such
is the evolution of mankind as seen through spiritual eyes.

And there is another point. What the holy Rishis revered as Vishva
Karman, what Zarathustra addressed as the Ahura Mazdao of the sun, and
what Moses reverenced as *ehjeh asher ehjeh* --- this had to appear in a
single human being, in Jesus of Nazareth, in a physically circumscribed
human being. This consummation was fore-ordained. But to enable so
exalted a being to dwell in such a person as Jesus of Nazareth, many
circumstances had to contribute. For one thing, Jesus of Nazareth
himself had to have arrived at an exalted level. Not every man could be
the vehicle of such a being that came into the world as described. Now,
we who have made contact with spiritual science know that there is
reincarnation, so we must realize that Jesus of Nazareth --- not the
Christ --- had experienced many incarnations and that He had passed
through the most manifold stages in his previous incarnations before he
could become Jesus of Nazareth.

What this means is that Jesus of Nazareth had Himself to become a high
initiate before He could become the Christ bearer. Now, when a lofty
initiate is born, how do such a birth and the subsequent life differ
from the birth and life of an ordinary person? In a general way it can
be assumed that when a man is born he bears the characteristics, at
least approximately, of what derives from a previous incarnation. But
that is not the case with an initiate. The initiate could not be a
leader of mankind if he bore within him only what wholly corresponds
with his outer self, for that he must build up according to the
conditions of his external environment. When an initiate is born there
must enter his body a lofty soul that in past times has had mighty
experiences in the world. That is why legend so often tells of the
strange births of initiates.

As to why and how this is so, we have already touched upon the answer to
the first of these questions. It is because a comprehensive I that had
already passed through significant experiences in the past now unites
with a body, but this body is at first unable to receive what seeks to
incarnate in it as spiritual nature. For this reason it is necessary, in
the case of a lofty being incarnating as a high initiate in a perishable
human being, that the reincarnating I should from the start envelop the
physical form more intensely than in the case of other people. While in
the ordinary human being the physical form resembles and adapts itself
soon after birth to the spiritual form, or human aura, the human aura of
a reborn initiate is luminous at birth. It is the spiritual part that
here indicates the presence of more than can be seen in the ordinary
sense. What does this indicate? That not only has a child been born in
the physical world, but that something has occurred in the spiritual
world. The stories that attach to the birth of all reincarnating
initiates express the idea, not only is a child born: something is born
in the spirit as well, something that cannot be encompassed by what is
born down below.

But who can discern this? Only one who himself has a clairvoyant eye for
the spiritual world. Hence we are told that in the birth of Buddha an
initiate recognized an event differing from an ordinary birth; and hence
also it is related of Jesus of Nazareth that his coming was to be
foretold by the Baptist. All who have insight into the spiritual world
know that the initiate must come and be reborn; and they know that this
is an event in the spiritual world. The Three Kings from the East who
came to offer sacrifice at the birth of Jesus of Nazareth knew it, too.
And the same truth is indicated when the initiated Priest of the Temple
says:

Now I can die gladly, since mine eyes have beheld the One Who will be
the salvation of mankind.

Clearly, then, we must here differentiate accurately. We have an exalted
initiate reborn as Jesus of Nazareth, of whose birth it must be said
that a child was born; but with this child there appeared something that
will not be encompassed by His physical body. This discloses at the same
time something in Jesus of Nazareth that has significance in the
spiritual world, something that will gradually develop this body upward
to the point at which it will be fit to receive this spirit. And when
this was fulfilled, we have the event in which the Baptist approaches
Jesus of Nazareth, and a loftier spirit descends and unites with Jesus
of Nazareth: the Christ enters Jesus of Nazareth. And then the Baptist,
the Forerunner of the Christ Jesus, could well say: *I came into the
world. It was I who prepared the way for a loftier one. With the words
of my mouth I proclaimed the coming of the Kingdom of God, the Realm of
the Heavens, and I exhorted men to change their hearts. I came among
men, and it was vouchsafed me to bring them tidings of a special impulse
that is to come to mankind. As in the springtime the sun mounts higher
to announce the budding of something new, so did I appear to bring
tidings of what is burgeoning in mankind as the reborn I of humanity.*

Then, when the human principle had reached its height in Jesus of
Nazareth, his human body having become an expression of his spirit, he
was ripe to receive within himself the Christ at the Baptism by John.
The body of Jesus of Nazareth had unfolded like the bright sun on St.
John\'s Day in June. That had been foretold. Then the spirit was to be
born out of the darkness, just as the sun steadily gains in strength and
power up to St. John\'s Day, and then begins to decline. That was what
the Baptist had to proclaim. He had to continue to bear witness until
--- pointing to the sun\'s ever-increasing splendor --- he could say, he
of whom the old Prophets told, He who in the spiritual realms has been
called the Son of the Spiritual Realms, has appeared. --- Up to this
point John the Baptist was active. But then --- when the days become
shorter and darkness begins to gain the upper hand --- then the inner
spiritual light is to shine as a result of right preparation, is to
become ever brighter as the Christ shines in Jesus of Nazareth.

That is the way John the Baptist saw the approach of Jesus of Nazareth;
and he felt the growth of Jesus of Nazareth as his own diminution and as
the increase in the power of the sun. From now on I shall wane, he said,
even as the sun wanes after St. John\'s Day. But He will wax --- He the
spiritual sun --- and shine out of the darkness. --- Thus was the Christ
heralded; and thus began the rebirth of the I of mankind, upon which
depends the rebirth of every individual higher human I.

This characterizes the most important event in the development of the
individual human being: the rebirth of what can proceed from the
