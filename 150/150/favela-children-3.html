Chapter 3</h2>
</header>
<main>
<p style="font-weight:bold">Londrina, October 14</p>
<p>This evening I was again with the old Macumba priestess, Dona
Jacinta. She is of imposing appearance, vital, strong, tolerant and
unwavering. One can imagine that she would be honored in heathen Africa
as a symbol of the Earth Mother. You feel well in her presence, she
exudes calmness.</p>
<p>She led me into her Macumba-room. On one side are wooden benches, in
the opposite corner stands her altar with its countless holy figures.
Many gods have Christian as well as heathen names. For example
St. George is Ogún, the god of war in the African religion. St. Michael
corresponds to Xangó, the god of thunder and lightning. Yemanjá, the
sea-goddess, is the Virgin Mary. Exú is the Devil and Oxalá, the god of
life and fertility, corresponds to Jesus and the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Dona Jacinta offered to read the cards for me. From a pocket in her
wide gown she took out a deck of well-thumbed cards on which I caught
fleeting glimpses of plants, houses, the moon and stars. She laid them
down on the table with a slow gesture and crossed herself and the cards.
I had to cut them (No, with the left hand), and she began.</p>
<p>You have many protective gods, especially the sun. Soon you will make
an important decision and, later on, not live in Germany. You will have
a very troubled life, put much in order, much in disorder, <em>minha
filha</em>.</p>
<p>When I told her that I often have headaches, she offered to "push my
head right". So I will soon put myself under her care. She has a
thriving medical practice, even people from the wealthy neighborhoods
visit her. I asked her how long she had been doing this work.</p>
<p><em>Minha Filha</em>, I began in Bahia. I lived in the country where
my parents had a tiny piece of land to grow sugarcane. I was strong,
wild and unruly (<em>braba)</em>. I loved to ride wild horses all day
long. Now and then I had a <em>namorado</em> (boyfriend). Suddenly I
became very ill. A doctor treated me but he couldn't help. Then someone
told me, "Go to the <em>Macumbeiro</em>! I went and the spirit came over
me and shook off the illness. But the most important thing was that my
nature changed. I became gentle (<em>mansa</em>), tolerant, calm. Octal
ordered me to work, so I became a <em>Macumbeira</em>."</p>
<p>And what does the Catholic Church say to this?</p>
<p>The Church does not like it. But what can she do against it? There
will always be Macumba in the favela. The poor receive comfort and
support from me which the impersonal machinery of the Catholic Church
cannot give them. I bless each one personally, whereas the Catholic
priest only does mass blessings. All find in me an open ear for their
troubles, while the Catholic Church is a church for the rich only. I am
a Catholic myself. One can do both. Macumba is a way to experience faith
physically. Each should come to God in the way He is most visible. The
sea-goddess Yemanjá and the Virgin Mary, the spirit Xangó and St.
Hieronymous: are they not the same gods who have descended to earth in
different forms? Just as Catholics have their saints we also have them,
often Black and Indian martyrs from the slavery time. Only God knows the
truth, men must be tolerant.</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold">Londrina, Oct. 26</p>
<p>We have just returned from a Fazenda, a real cattle ranch, the house
airily built, the birds flying in one side and out the other. The eye
ranges over the extensive hilly land and the cleared jungle with
burnt-out tree stumps. We met the owner, a former agriculture minister
and Prefect of Londrina, as he was inoculating his cattle against a skin
disease. The <em>Dona da casa</em> brought us creamy milk, finally
undiluted with water. She greeted us cordially, but apparently goes
through Brazil with her eyes closed, because we had to tell her about
favelas in detail as she has yet to see one.</p>
<p>One can hardly imagine how rich these people are. Fray Nereu told us
recently that a rancher he knows earned $160,000 this year alone - while
there are favela children who have never played with a doll. Brazilians
also think almost exclusively in terms of these extreme contrasts. They
often don't know how they should classify us. I realized this when the
son of the owner of the Funganti department store, made uncertain by our
living in the favela and at the same time frequenting the country club,
asked: Are you rich or poor?</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold">Londrina, Nov. 6</p>
<p>Four days leave from the favela! A jeep from the prefecture picked us
up and we drove over hard-packed red earth roads to a lake in
the middle of the jungle where the prefecture owns a holiday house for
city employees and "other important persons".</p>
<p>The weather was cool, sunny, clear air like in the mountains,
wonderful for hiking, walking and physical exertion. In the morning we
walked on narrow paths hacked through the jungle to a huge waterfall. In
the afternoon I went off alone. It's somehow uncanny the cracking of
twigs by unseen animals in the underbrush, the birds' warning cries
becoming increasingly shrill as you draw nearer. You feel lost amid this
exuberant growth of upward striving, thorny brush, bamboo cane swaying
in the wind, ninety feet high <em>pinhieros</em> (pines) and coconut
palms, especially when the midday heat weighs so crushingly on the
earth. Once we got up at 4 a.m. and explored the lake shore and its
side-streams in a boat. They were often so narrow that the jungle closed
in again behind us, over us a steep wall of green. Steering the boat was
an artistic feat that won me the title "King of Helmsmen". We navigated
thus for almost seven hours. Meanwhile hunger drove us to land and
luckily I recognized a sugar-cane field from a distance; chewing
sugar-cane and quite full we went on.</p>
<p>Another time a ranch owner's son, an ex-boy scout, took us out. He
was an interesting mixture of Portuguese, African and Brazilian Indian
blood (his facial characteristics seemed pure southern India). He led us
through once cleared but now heavily overgrown jungle and showed us
Indian medicinal herbs against rheumatism, colds, boils.</p>
<p>I often visit the black Macumba lady which, unfortunately, usually
includes food. Can you imagine how much gagging you have to do to get
dry manioca meal down? Her healing practice is apparently flourishing.
Recently an alcoholic of German descent from Rio Grande do Sul went to
her to be cured. Dona Jacinta has a <em>caixa postal</em> (post office
box) to receive letters of thanks, although she can't read.</p>
<p>This evening we were elegant again. An invitation to the opening of
an antique furniture shop. The problem of how to get from the dripping,
muddy favela to the city was solved in the classic manner: the prefect
happened to be visiting and he drove us in. How unnatural you act when
you want to be elegant. We had to laugh at the affected fussing and
twittering of the heavily powdered and dazzlingly painted ladies (lilac
tinted hair to match a lilac dress), the fashionably pursed lips, the
bare traces of smiles. We moved about in the crowd and now and then
retreated to a corner to laugh our heads off. The German pastor's
reproachful look (raised eyebrow, severe lines around his mouth) is
worth mentioning, and his words: But I've never seen you in my church.
<em>Deus me livre </em>(God forbid).</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold">Londrina, Christmas 1965</p>
<p>We were invited to spend Christmas with a Brazilian family from
Guarpava (South Paraná). We went via Apucarana, Ponta Grossa. The
asphalt ends there and the route continues over the terra roxa, "roads"
so bumpy, muddy and full of holes that the bus often listed like a ship;
then came another strip of asphalt; our speed seemed that of an airplane
on the runway. The monotonous landscape is relieved in Paranoia by
pasture land with scattered cows and occasional jungle.</p>
<p>After a fourteen hour drive we reached Guarapava. How rich our hosts
were we couldn't have imagined. When we learned through snatches of
conversation that half the city (electricity and water works, fertilizer
factory, sawmill, cattle and pig raising) belongs to them we put aside
our humbleness and abandoned ourselves to gluttony. We paid no attention
to ordinary stomach-fillers such as rice and potatoes; only fruit,
vegetables, nuts, cake and meat, meat, meat did we eat. Meals were taken
in a special wooden building, a dining-house, so to speak, in which the
<em>churrasco</em>, (roast meat) was cooked on spits over an open fire.
The spits with half a pig, goats and oxen were stuck into the wooden
table at which we were all seated and each cut off as much as he wanted.
What a treat for our stomachs so used to rice and beans!</p>
<p>We spent one afternoon at the German colony Entre Rios. The landscape
was transformed with a stroke -- waving wheat fields, orderly juicy
green pastures with black and white cows -- a piece of Germany. The
contrast with the barely cultivated land we were used to was so great
that we began to vehemently debate about why Brazilians don't manage to
do the same. I think that the Brazilian fazendeiro's relationship to the
earth is different from a German's. The German farmer cherishes and
cultivates his land, which becomes the embodiment of his home. The
fazendeiro is more an administrator of property, from which he exacts
the greatest profit with the least effort, than a farmer. The intensive
cultivation of a small piece of land doesn't interest him. He operates
an extensive cattle business or plants one crop over a huge area until
the land is exhausted (sugarcane, tobacco, coffee). Historically this is
understandable. The Portuguese came as adventurers and merchants and not
as land-hungry farmers. Their strength lay in exploring the interior,
not in cultivating the discovered. Nor did the nomadic Indian tribes
contribute to the creation of the farming ethic. They lived from hunting
and fishing, burned out clearings here and there in the jungle in order
to plant manioca, corn and tobacco, then abandoned the exhausted land.
The present day jungle burning and the lack of fertilizer is reminiscent
of those methods.</p>
<p>But back to the German colonists. The majority of them came from
Banat (Yugoslavia), the so-called Danube Germans. After the Second World
War they fled and the Swiss foreign aid organizations gave them a few
acres of land in Brazil, some cows and a little money. They started with
practically nothing, planted wheat (rare in Brazil) and many have become
so rich that they are overwhelmed by their steadily growing lands and
income. These Danube Germans hold Brazilian citizenship but speak
faltering Portuguese and are very anxious to preserve the heritage of
their forefathers.</p>
<p>As with so many German immigrants they identify with a Germany which
no longer exists, sing folk-songs which we would call sentimental and
talk about a Germany in which it is impossible to be free. The Germany
of the nineteenth century and the world depression have been spiritually
mummified here.</p>
