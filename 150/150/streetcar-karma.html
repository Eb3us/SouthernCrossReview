<p class="intro">A lecture wasn't exactly what I had in mind for the evening, but
there we were, Katrina and I, approaching the hall where it was to take
place. A full moon shone into the narrow cobblestoned street. Its
presence more or less guaranteed that there would be no more snow that
night.</p>
<p>That same day, I think it was early afternoon, I had boarded a
streetcar and found a spot among the standees, when the clasp on my
briefcase somehow opened as we rounded a sharp curve and the books and
papers tumbled out. I bent to retrieve them and fell against another
standee, knocking her over and falling almost on top of her. I stammered
apologies in German, my native tongue, instead of Czech. My reaction was
automatic, but the fact is that in that enlightened age all educated
people in Prague spoke German. Hers was lightly accented. She helped me
pick up my things, which were strewn around and soiled by the slush the
passengers' shoes had tracked into the car. An elderly couple vacated a
double seat at the next stop and I quickly grasped the hand-guard and
invited her to sit next to the window. I took my place next to her on
the aisle. She wasn't a beautiful woman, at least not in the usual
sense. You could have called her attractive though. Her most salient
feature was her smile, wide and spontaneous, lighting up her face.
Though she wore a heavy fur coat against the cold, I could tell that she
was somewhat plump, which was to my taste.</p>
<p>The bump, the fall and the shared retrieval task had served as an
icebreaker, so I introduced myself and we talked and laughed about it
and, naturally, I invited her to join me in one of those delightful
Prague cafés for coffee and cake. But she pleaded a previous engagement,
so I asked her to go with me to the theater that evening. She blushed,
smiled, and said yes. When we reached her stop she started to get off,
but at the door she turned and said, quickly, "No, don't buy the
tickets, but we'll meet there anyway. I'll explain later." The doors
opened and she stepped down and out. I noticed some of my fellow
passengers smirking, but I didn't care, I was already in love – at first
sight, as they say. A little boy sitting on the aisle stared at me with
a fey look. I looked at him inquiringly and he turned away.</p>
<p>Katarina was already waiting at the theater entrance when I arrived
five minutes early. She smiled and I shivered more with expectation than
from the cold. “I'm so sorry," she said, "but I forgot an engagement for
this evening when I told you I could go to the theater." My heart sank,
but she continued before I could say anything. "I'm going there alone
though. Why don't you join me?" That was more like it. I agreed of
course. "We must hurry," she said. "We don't want to be late."</p>
<p>"Of course not," I assented, although I couldn't have cared less.
"Where are we going?"</p>
<p>"To a lecture, it's not far from here."</p>
<p>My heart sank again or, more accurately, took a little dip, for my
idea had been the theater, then dinner with enough good German (or even
Czech) wine.  We were together though and that, although the
circumstances were different from those I had anticipated, was
sufficient to make me happy. She took my arm as we walked carefully over
the icy streets.</p>
<p>A poster was stuck on the door of the lecture room. It said something
about "Spiritual Science". My God, I thought, what have I gotten into?
Many believe that now, the beginning of the twentieth-first century, is
a materialistic age. The fact is, however, that the first quarter of the
previous century was at the apogee of materialism. Everyone believed in
natural science then, and its findings and its arrogance were
unquestioned.</p>
<p>The lecturer was to be a Dr. Rudolf Steiner.</p>
<p>The room, not very large, was almost full and there were no two seats
together. Katarina sat on the aisle and I had to sit two rows behind and
to the right of her. This arrangement was unsatisfactory of course, but
I appeased myself with the thought that I could at least observe her
profile instead of Dr. Steiner's pot-belly.</p>
<p>Exactly at the starting time he entered from a side door and stood
alongside the podium instead of behind it. "<em>Sehr geehrte Damen und
Herren</em> ..." A formal opening in a deeply resonant, Austrian
accented voice. I had decided to listen with at least half an ear in
case she wanted to discuss what he said afterwards, but that was
impossible. Rudolf Steiner captured one's attention totally. He didn't
have a pot-belly, by the way. He was thin, of average height for those
days, dark complexioned with pitch-black, straight hair. He was dressed
in black as well, except for a white shirt, with a frock coat and an
artist's black silk tie. After the formal opening he became warmer,
then, after a half-hour, very warm. He turned the world upside-down,
saying things that were completely new to me, but which I somehow
recognized as being true, as though I had always known them and was now
being reminded. He spoke of a spiritual world that was real, of the
nature of man as a spiritual being who is in a constant process of
development through many lives.</p>
<p>My head swam and I completely forgot Katarina's profile. In fact, at
one point near the end I felt I was going to faint, so profound an
effect did he and his words have on me. (Katarina told me later than
people actually did faint sometimes, which could be embarrassing if they
were sitting on an aisle. When this happened Steiner didn't even pause
while the unconscious body was dragged out into the fresh air.)</p>
<p>After it was over and the thunderous applause died out, I sat alone.
Katarina came and took my hand. I stood up and followed her out of the
hall. I suppose the cold air brought me to my senses. We went to a café
after all and I asked her about what had just happened, which was the
turning point in my life, what was left of it.</p>
<p>We were together on the following two evenings, and never again. I
was a lieutenant in the German army and had to leave on the third day
for the front. It was August 1914, and I, fool that I was, had
volunteered to fight for our glorious fatherland. We spent our last
evening together as lovers. I had an intuition that I would never see
her again and I think she had the same feeling. Not that I believed I'd
be killed in the war, young men never think that until it happens.</p>
<h4>Sojourn</h4>
<p>My sojourn in the other world was so short because my life on earth
had been so brief. It is only recently that I have had the ability to
see my past life, parts of it at least, and to catch glimpses of the
immediate future. I know that Katarina is here, because she also died
young, and we will meet on a streetcar again. I've concentrated to the
limit of my powers, but have not succeeded in determining where I should
look. Perhaps I shouldn't look, just wait for it to happen of itself
like last time. But no, things have changed and I must use my
intelligence and will – and hope for luck, that's still allowed.</p>
<h4>San Francisco</h4>
<p>Luck came my way today. I switched on the TV and saw a picture of one
of those famous San Francisco cable cars. Of course. Why hadn't I
thought of that before? I flew to San Francisco and have been riding the
cable cars for the past week. After the first two days I decided to ride
only during rush hours – eight to nine in the morning and five to six in
the afternoon – when there are standees and I can be one. A problem is
that there are no curves to cause the accident. It has occurred to me
that I could be in the wrong place. Once I was in Lisbon and rode on a
similar streetcar, but with curves. It's probably still there. Lisbon
doesn't change. But my intuition tells me he's in America and San
Francisco seems to be the most likely place. No, "he" isn't a slip of
the tongue. I haven't mentioned yet that I'm a woman in this incarnation
and Katarina is a man; should be at least, it's the rule.</p>
<p>Today it happened. During the middle of the short uphill trip a
handsome young man in an air force officer's uniform got on. I noticed
that one clasp of his attaché-case was open and I waited for the other
one to spring. He placed the case on the floor alongside his leg and
opened a newspaper to read. The headline read: <em>U.S. Ground Forces
Invade Iraq</em>. I decided to give karma a kick-off and nudged his
attaché-case with my foot. It fell over and the other clasp clicked
open. He leaned down and quickly picked up the case by its handle. The
contents, loose papers and two books, flew out. Just as he bent down to
retrieve them the streetcar's brakes squealed, he fell against me and we
both went down, me on the bottom. He helped me up, apologizing and
trying frantically to gather up his things. I looked out of the window
to see what had caused the sudden stop. The driver leaned out and yelled
at a little girl to watch where she was going or she'd get killed. She
looked at me from the sidewalk with that familiar fey look. Then she
disappeared into the crowd. I helped him pick up his things and we sat
in the seats vacated by a gay couple. After introductions and some small
talk, he asked me to have dinner with him tonight. Naturally I
accepted.</p>
<p>We are in a restaurant in Chinatown. He sips a glass of California
wine and tells me that he's an instructor at a nearby airbase, but he's
had no combat experience so he's requesting a transfer to the Middle
East. It will be good for his career. He is so happy about it, so
convinced, so foolish. Oh God, must it be a three-night stand again? Is
there no way out? If I tell him what I know about us would it help, or
will he think me mad? Behind him, on the wall, is a large mirror in
which I can see the back of his head, myself and the street through the
window behind me. My heart jumps when I see the little girl with the fey
look outside on the street staring at me in the mirror. "No!" I cry
silently, and put my hand over my mouth. The little girl's fey look
slowly relents and she smiles.</p>
<p>"Is something wrong?" he asks.</p>
<p>I look into his concerned eyes. "No", I say, "everything's fine."
Because I know, I pray, that it will be different this time. When I look
back into the mirror I see only the back of his head, myself and the
window behind me. The little girl is gone.</p>
