<main>
<p class="intro">My name is Bill Astore and I’m a card-carrying member of the
military-industrial complex (MIC).</p>
<p>Sure, I hung up my military uniform for the last time in 2005. <a
href="https://tomdispatch.com/astore-on-a-military-bemedaled-bothered-and-beleaguered/"><strong>Since
2007</strong></a>, I’ve been writing articles
for <em>TomDispatch</em> focused largely on critiquing that same MIC and
America’s permanent war economy. I’ve written against this country’s <a
href="https://tomdispatch.com/william-astore-america-s-mutant-military/"><strong>wasteful</strong></a> and <a
href="https://tomdispatch.com/william-astore-grinding-down-the-u-s-army/"><strong>unwise</strong></a> wars
in <a
href="https://tomdispatch.com/william-astore-america-s-hollow-foreign-legions/"><strong>Iraq</strong></a> and <a
href="https://tomdispatch.com/william-astore-washington-s-compulsive-gambling/"><strong>Afghanistan</strong></a>,
its <a href="https://tomdispatch.com/rewarding-failure/"><strong>costly
and disastrous</strong></a> weapons systems, and its <a
href="https://tomdispatch.com/william-astore-thinking-about-the-unthinkable-2020-style/"><strong>undemocratic
embrace</strong></a> of warriors and <a
href="https://tomdispatch.com/william-astore-american-militarism-on-steroids/"><strong>militarism</strong></a>. Nevertheless,
I remain a lieutenant colonel, if a retired one. I still have my
military ID card, if only to get on bases, and I still tend to say “we”
when I talk about my fellow soldiers, Marines, sailors, and airmen (and
our “guardians,” too, now that we have a Space Force).</p>
<p><span id="anchor"></span>So, when I talk to organizations that are
antiwar, that seek to downsize, dismantle, or otherwise weaken the MIC,
I’m upfront about my military biases even as I add my own voice to their
critiques. Of course, you don’t have to be antiwar to be highly
suspicious of the U.S. military. Senior leaders in “my” military have <a
href="https://tomdispatch.com/integrity-optional/"><strong>lied so
often</strong></a>, whether in the Vietnam War era of the last century
or in this one about “progress” in Iraq and Afghanistan, that you’d have
to be asleep at the wheel or ignorant not to have suspected the official
story.</p>
<p>Yet I also urge antiwar forces to see more than mendacity or malice
in “our” military. It was retired general and then-President Dwight D.
Eisenhower, after all, who first warned Americans of the profound
dangers of the military-industrial complex in his <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyBNmecVtdU"><strong>1961 farewell
address</strong></a>. Not enough Americans heeded Ike’s warning then
and, judging by our near-constant state of warfare since that time, not
to speak of our ever-ballooning “defense” budgets, very few have heeded
his warning to this day. How to explain that?</p>
<p>Well, give the MIC credit. Its tenacity has been amazing. You might
compare it to an invasive weed, a parasitic cowbird (an image I’ve <a
href="https://tomdispatch.com/william-astore-drowning-in-militarism/"><strong>used
before</strong></a>), or even a metastasizing cancer. As a weed, it’s
choking democracy; as a cowbird, it’s gobbling up most of the “food” (at
least half of the federal discretionary budget) with no end in sight; as
a cancer, it continues to spread, weakening our individual freedoms and
liberty. </p>
<p>Call it what you will. The question is: How do we stop it? I’ve
offered suggestions in the past; so, too, have writers
for <em>TomDispatch</em> like retired Army Colonel <a
href="https://tomdispatch.com/authors/andrewbacevich/"><strong>Andrew
Bacevich</strong></a> and retired Army Major <a
href="https://tomdispatch.com/spilling-ink-and-spilling-blood/"><strong>Danny
Sjursen</strong></a>, as well as <a
href="https://tomdispatch.com/what-price-defense-2/"><strong>William
Hartung</strong></a>, <a
href="https://tomdispatch.com/spending-unlimited/"><strong>Julia
Gledhill</strong></a>, and <a
href="https://tomdispatch.com/authors/alfredmccoy/"><strong>Alfred
McCoy</strong></a> among others. Despite our critiques, the MIC grows
ever stronger. If Ike’s warning wasn’t eye-opening enough, enhanced by
an even more powerful speech, “<a
href="https://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/mlkatimetobreaksilence.htm"><strong>Beyond
Vietnam</strong></a>,” by Martin Luther King, Jr., in 1967, what could I
and my fellow <em>TomDispatch</em> writers possibly say or do to make a
difference?</p>
<p>Maybe nothing, but that won’t stop me from trying. Since I am the
MIC, so to speak, maybe I can look within for a few lessons that came to
me the hard way (in the sense that I had to live them). So, what have l
learned of value?</p>
<p><strong>War Racketeers Enjoy Their Racket</strong></p>
<p>In the 1930s, Smedley Butler, a Marine general twice decorated with
the Medal of Honor, wrote a book entitled <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Is_a_Racket"><strong><em>War Is
a Racket</em></strong></a>. He knew better than most since, as he <a
href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/253269-i-spent-33-years-and-four-months-in-active-military"><strong>confessed</strong></a> in
that volume, when he wore a military uniform, he served as “a racketeer,
a gangster for capitalism.” And the corporate-driven racket he helped
enable almost a century ago by busting heads from the Caribbean to China
was small-scale indeed compared to today’s thoroughly global one.</p>
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1642598348/ref=nosim/?tag=tomdispatch-20"><div class="polaroid"><img class="b" src="astore_book_cover.jpg" alt="On Shedding an Obsolete Past book cover" style="width:100%"><div class="container"><p>Buy the Book!</p></div></div></a>
<p>There’s an obvious lesson to be drawn from its striking endurance,
never-ending enlargement, and distinct engorgement in our moment (even
after all those lost wars it fought): the system will not reform
itself.  It will always demand and take more — more money, more
authority, more power.  It will never be geared for peace.  By its
nature, it’s authoritarian and distinctly less than honorable, replacing
patriotism with service loyalty and victory with triumphant budgetary
authority.  And it always favors the darkest of scenarios, including at
present a <a
href="https://tomdispatch.com/arsenal-of-democracy-or-simply-an-arsenal/"><strong>new
cold war</strong></a> with China and Russia, because that’s the best and
most expedient way for it to thrive.</p>
<p>Within the military-industrial complex, there are no incentives to do
the right thing.  Those few who have a conscience and speak out
honorably are punished, including truth-tellers in the enlisted ranks
like <a
href="https://theintercept.com/2016/05/19/chelsea-manning-appeals-unprecedented-conviction/"><strong>Chelsea
Manning</strong></a> and <a
href="https://bracingviews.com/2021/07/23/daniel-hales-heartfelt-letter-against-drone-warfare/"><strong>Daniel
Hale</strong></a>. Even being an officer doesn’t make you immune.  For
his temerity in resisting the Vietnam War, <a
href="https://taskandpurpose.com/news/medal-of-honor-hero-david-shoup-vietnam/"><strong>David
M. Shoup</strong></a>, a retired Marine Corps general and Medal of Honor
recipient, was typically dismissed by his peers as unbalanced and of
questionable sanity.</p>
<p>For all the talk of “mavericks,” whether in <em>Top Gun</em> or
elsewhere, we — there’s that “we” again (I can’t help myself!) — in the
military are a hotbed of go-along-to-get-along conformity.</p>
<p>Recently, I was talking with a senior enlisted colleague about why so
few top-ranking officers are willing to speak truth to the powerless
(that’s you and me) even after they retire. He mentioned credibility. To
question the system, to criticize it, to air dirty laundry in public is
to risk losing credibility within the club and so to be rejected as a
malcontent, disloyal, even “unbalanced.” Then, of course, that
infamous <a
href="https://www.pogo.org/analysis/2022/01/the-pentagons-revolving-door-keeps-spinning-2021-in-review"><strong>revolving
door</strong></a> between the military and giant weapons makers like
Boeing and Raytheon simply won’t spin for you.  Seven-figure
compensation packages, like the one current Secretary of Defense Lloyd
Austin <a
href="https://www.pogo.org/database/pentagon-revolving-door/people/lloyd-j-austin"><strong>gained
from Raytheon</strong></a> after his retirement as an Army general,
won’t be an option. And in America, who doesn’t want to cash in while
gaining more power within the system?</p>
<p>Quite simply, it pays so much better to mouth untruths, or at least
distinctly less-than-full-truths, in service to the powerful. And with
that in mind, here, at least as I see it, are a few full truths about my
old service, the Air Force, that I guarantee you I won’t be applauded
for mentioning. How about this as a start: that the production of F-35s
— an overpriced “Ferrari” of a fighter jet that’s both <a
href="https://tomdispatch.com/william-astore-a-wasteful-weapon-for-america-s-forever-wars/"><strong>too
complex and remarkably successful as an underperformer</strong></a> —
should be canceled (savings: as much as $1 trillion over time); that the
much-touted new <a
href="https://tomdispatch.com/william-astore-enabling-armageddon/"><strong>B-21
nuclear bomber</strong></a> isn’t needed (savings: at least $200
billion) and neither is the new <a
href="https://www.defensenews.com/air/2022/04/05/heres-the-new-name-of-the-us-air-forces-next-gen-nuke/"><strong>Sentinel
Intercontinental Ballistic Missile</strong></a> (savings: another $200
billion and possibly the entire Earth from doomsday); that the KC-46
tanker is <a
href="https://breakingdefense.com/2022/12/after-years-of-kc-46-vision-system-troubles-boeing-thinks-its-finally-cracked-the-code/"><strong>seriously
flawed</strong></a> and should be canceled (savings: another $50
billion). </p>
<p>Now, tote it up. By canceling the F-35, the B-21, the Sentinel, and
the KC-46, I singlehandedly saved the American taxpayer roughly $1.5
trillion without hurting America’s national defense in the least. But
I’ve also just lost all credibility (assuming I had any left) with my
old service.</p>
<p>Look, what matters to the military-industrial complex isn’t either
the truth or saving your taxpayer dollars but keeping those weapons
programs going and the money flowing. What matters, above all, is
keeping America’s economy on a permanent wartime footing both by buying
endless new (and old) weapons systems for the military and <a
href="https://tomdispatch.com/arsenal-of-autocracy/"><strong>selling
them globally</strong></a> in a bizarrely Orwellian pursuit of peace
through war. </p>
<p>How are Americans, Ike’s “alert and knowledgeable citizenry,”
supposed to end a racket like this? We certainly should know one thing
by now: the MIC will never check itself and Congress, already part of it
thanks to impressive campaign donations and the like by major weapons
makers, won’t corral it either.  Indeed, last year, Congress shoveled <a
href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/11/30/house-senate-negotiators-45b-biden-defense-budget-00071367"><strong>$45
billion</strong></a> more than the Biden administration requested (more
even than the Pentagon asked for) to that complex, all ostensibly in
your name. Who cares that it hasn’t won a war of the faintest
significance since 1945. Even “victory” in the Cold War (after the
Soviet Union imploded in 1991) was thrown away. And now the complex
warns us of an onrushing “new cold war” to be waged, naturally, at
tremendous cost to you, the American taxpayer.  </p>
<p>As citizens, we must be informed, willing, and able to act. And
that’s precisely why the complex seeks to deny you knowledge, precisely
why it seeks <a
href="https://tomdispatch.com/william-astore-the-face-of-war-don-t-look/"><strong>to
isolate you</strong></a> from its actions in this world. So, it’s up to
you — to us! — to remain alert and involved. Most of all, each of us
must struggle to keep our identity and autonomy as a citizen, a rank
higher than that of any general or admiral, for, as we all need to be
reminded, those wearing uniforms are supposed to serve you, not
vice-versa.</p>
<p>I know you hear otherwise. You’ve been told repeatedly in these years
that it’s your job to “support our troops.” Yet, in truth, those troops
should only exist to support and defend you, and of course the
Constitution, the compact that binds us all together as a nation.</p>
<p>When misguided citizens genuflect before those troops (and then
ignore everything that’s done in their name), I’m reminded yet again of
Ike’s sage warning that only Americans can truly hurt this
country. Military service may be necessary, but it’s not necessarily <a
href="https://tomdispatch.com/william-astore-wars-don-t-make-heroes/"><strong>ennobling</strong></a>. America’s
founders were profoundly skeptical of large militaries, of entangling
alliances with foreign powers, and of permanent wars and threats of the
same. So should we all be.</p>
<p><strong>Citizens United Is the Answer</strong></p>
<p>No, not <em>that</em> “<a
href="https://truthout.org/articles/corporations-are-citizens-what-are-we/"><strong>Citizens
United</strong></a>,” not the case in which the Supreme Court decided
corporations had the same free speech rights as you and me, allowing
them to coopt the legislative process by drowning us out with massive
amounts of “speech,” aka dark-money-driven propaganda. We need citizens
united against America’s war machine.</p>
<p>Understanding how that machine works — not just its waste and
corruption, but also its positive attributes — is the best way to
wrestle it down, to make it submit to the people’s will. Yet activists
are sometimes ignorant of the most basic facts about “their”
military. So what? Does the difference between a sergeant major and a
major, or a chief petty officer and the chief of naval operations
matter? The answer is: yes.</p>
<p>An antimilitary approach anchored in ignorance won’t resonate with
the American people. An antiwar message anchored in knowledge could,
however. It’s important, that is, to hit the proverbial nail on the
head. Look, for example, at the traction Donald Trump gained in the
presidential race of 2015-2016 when he did something few other
politicians then dared do: dismiss the Iraq War as wasteful and
stupid. His election win in 2016 was not primarily about racism, nor the
result of a nefarious Russian plot. Trump won, at least in part because,
despite his ignorance on so many other things, he spoke a fundamental
truth — that America’s wars of this century were horrendous
blunders.</p>
<p>Trump, of course, was anything but antimilitary. He <a
href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-parade/trump-wants-military-parade-in-washington-washington-post-idUSKBN1FR03K"><strong>dreamed</strong></a> of
military parades in Washington, D.C. But I (grudgingly) give him credit
for boasting that he <a
href="https://archive.thinkprogress.org/generals-want-nothing-to-do-with-trump-0a5ad80cb682/"><strong>knew
more</strong></a> than his generals and by that I mean many more
Americans need to challenge those in authority, especially those in
uniform.</p>
<p>Yet challenging them is just a start. The only real way to wrestle
the military-industrial complex to the ground is to cut its funding in
half, whether gradually over years or in one fell swoop. Yes, indeed,
it’s the understatement of the century to note how much easier that’s
said than done. It’s not like any of us could wave a military swagger
stick like a magic wand and make half the Pentagon budget disappear. But
consider this: If I could do so, that military budget would still be
roughly $430 billion, easily more than China’s and Russia’s combined,
and more than seven times what this country spends on the State
Department. As usual, you get what you pay for, which for America has
meant more weapons and disastrous wars.</p>
<p>Join me in imagining the (almost) inconceivable — a Pentagon budget
cut in half. Yes, generals and admirals would scream and Congress would
squeal. But it would truly matter because, as a retired Army major
general once told me, major budget cuts would force the Pentagon to
think — for once. With any luck, a few sane and patriotic officers would
emerge to place the defense of America first, meaning that hubristic
imperial designs and forever wars would truly be reined in because
there’d simply be no more money for them.</p>
<p>Currently, Americans are giving the Pentagon all it wants — plus
some. And how’s that been working out for the rest of us? Isn’t it
finally time for us to exercise real oversight, as Ike challenged us to
do in 1961? Isn’t it time to force the Pentagon to pass an audit each
year — it’s failed <a
href="https://responsiblestatecraft.org/2022/11/22/why-cant-the-dod-get-its-financial-house-in-order/"><strong>the
last five</strong></a>! — or else cut its budget even more deeply? Isn’t
it time to hold Congress truly responsible for enabling ever more war by
voting out military sycophants? Isn’t it time to recognize, as <a
href="https://bracingviews.com/2013/06/28/no-nation-can-preserve-its-freedom-in-the-midst-of-continual-warfare/"><strong>America’s
founders did</strong></a>, that sustaining a vast military establishment
constitutes the slow and certain death of democracy?</p>
<p>Just remember one thing: the military-industrial complex won’t reform
itself. It just might have no choice, however, but to respond to our
demands, if we as citizens remain alert, knowledgeable, determined, and
united. And if it should refuse to, if the MIC can’t be tamed, whether
because of its strength or our weakness, you will know beyond doubt that
this country has truly lost its way.</p>
