		<p class="intro">Listen, good people, and you shall hear </p>
		<p>A story of old that will gladden your ear, </p>
		<p>The Tale of Barnaby, who was, they say, </p>
		<p>The finest tumbler of his day. </p>
<br>
		<p>In every town great crowds he drew,</p>
		<p>And all men marvelled to see him do </p>
		<p>The French Vault, the Vault of Champagne, </p>
		<p>The Vault of Metz, and the Vault of Lorraine. </p>
<br>
		<p>His eyes were blue, his figure was trim, </p>
		<p>He liked the girls and the girls liked him;</p>
		<p>For years he lived a life of vice, </p>
		<p>Drinking in taverns and throwing the dice. </p>
<br>
		<p>It happened one day he was riding along </p>
		<p>Between two cities, whistling a song, </p>
		<p>When he saw what then was quite common to see,</p>
		<p>Two ravens perched on a gallows-tree. </p>
<br>
		<p>‘Barnaby,’ the first raven began, </p>
		<p>‘Will one day be as this hanging man’: </p>
		<p>‘Yes,’ said the other, ‘and we know well </p>
		<p>That when that day comes he will go to Hell.’</p>
<br>
		<p>Then Barnaby’s conscience smote him sore; </p>
		<p>He repented of all he had done heretofore: </p>
		<p>‘Woe is me! I will forsake </p>
		<p>This wicked world and penance make.’ </p>
<br>
		<p>The evening air was grave and still</p>
		<p>When he came to a monastery built on a hill: </p>
		<p>As its bells the Angelus did begin. </p>
		<p>He knocked at the door and they let him in. </p>
<br>
		<p>(Choral music) </p>
<br>
		<p>The monks in that place were men of parts,</p>
		<p>Learned in the sciences and the arts:</p>
		<p>The Abbot could logically define </p>
		<p>The place of all creatures in the Scheme Divine. </p>
<br>
		<p>Brother Maurice then wrote down all that he said </p>
		<p>In a flowing script that it might be read, </p>
		<p>And Brother Alexander adorned the book </p>
		<p>With pictures that gave it a beautiful look. </p>
<br>
		<p>There were brothers there who could compose </p>
		<p>Latin Sequences in verse and prose, </p>
		<p>And a brother from Picardy, too, who sung </p>
		<p>The praise of Our Lady in the vulgar tongue.</p>
<br>
		<p>(Choral music) </p>
<br>
		<p>Now Barnaby had never learned to read, </p>
		<p>Nor Paternoster knew nor Creed; </p>
		<p>Watching them all at work and prayer, </p>
		<p>Barnaby’s heart began to despair. </p>
<br>
		<p>Down to the crypt at massing-time</p>
		<p>He crept like a man intent on crime: </p>
		<p>In a niche there above the altar stood </p>
		<p>A statue of Our Lady carved in wood. </p>
<br>
		<p>‘Blessed Virgin,’ he cried, ‘enthroned on high, </p>
		<p>Ignorant as a beast am I:</p>
		<p>Tumbling is all I have learnt to do; </p>
		<p>Mother-of-God, let me tumble for You.’ </p>
<br>
		<p>Straightway he stripped off his jerkin, </p>
		<p>And his tumbling acts he did begin: </p>
		<p>So eager was he to do Her honor</p>
		<p>That he vaulted higher than ever before. </p>
<br>
		<p>(Ballet music)</p>
<br>
		<p>The French Vault, the Vault of Champagne, </p>
		<p>The Vault of Metz and the Vault of Lorraine, </p>
		<p>He did them all till he sank to the ground, </p>
		<p>His body asweat and his head in a swound.</p>
<br>
		<p>Unmarked by him, Our Lady now </p>
		<p>Steps down from her niche and wipes his brow. </p>
		<p>‘Thank you, Barnaby,’ She said and smiled; </p>
		<p>‘Well have you tumbled for me, my child.’ </p>
<br>
		<p>From then on at the Office-Hours</p>
		<p>Barnaby went to pay Her his devoirs. </p>
		<p>One brother thought to himself: </p>
		<p>‘Now where Does Barnaby go at our times of prayer?’ </p>
<br>
		<p>And so next day when Barnaby slipped </p>
		<p>Away he followed him down to the crypt.</p>
		<p>When he saw how he honored the Mother-of-God, </p>
		<p>This brother thought: ‘This is very odd’. </p>
<br>
		<p>‘It may be well: I believe it is, </p>
		<p>But the Abbot, surely, should know of this.’</p>
		<p>To the Abbot he went with reverent mien </p>
		<p>And told him exactly what he had seen. </p>
<br>
		<p>The Abbot said to him: ‘Say no word </p>
		<p>To the others of what you have seen and heard. </p>
		<p>I will come to-morrow and watch with you </p>
		<p>Before I decide what I ought to do.’ </p>
<br>
		<p>Next day behind a pillar they hid, </p>
		<p>And the Abbot marked all that Barnaby did. </p>
		<p>Watching him leap and vault and tumble, </p>
		<p>He thought, ‘This man is holy and humble.’ </p>
<br>
		<p>(Ballet music) </p>
<br>
		<p>‘Lady,’ cried Barnaby, ‘I beg of Thee</p>
		<p>To intercede with Thy Son for me!’, </p>
		<p>Gave one more leap, then down he dropped, </p>
		<p>And lay dead still, for his heart had stopped. </p>
<br>
		<p>Then grinning demons, black as coal, </p>
		<p>Swarmed out of Hell to seize his soul:</p>
		<p>‘In vain shall be his pious fuss, </p>
		<p>For every tumbler belongs to us.’ </p>
<br>
		<p>(Ballet music) </p>
<br>
		<p>But Our Lady and Her angels held them at bay, </p>
		<p>With shining swords they drove them away, </p>
		<p>And Barnaby’s soul they bore aloft,</p>
		<p>Singing with voices sweet and soft. </p>
<br>
		<p>CHORUS: Gloria in excelsis Deo.  </p>

	<div class="footnote">
		<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Wystan Hugh Auden</span> (21 February 1907 – 29 September 1973) was an English-American poet. Auden's poetry was noted for its stylistic and technical achievement, its engagement with politics, morals, love, and religion, and its variety in tone, form and content. He came to wide public attention with his first book <span style="font-style:normal">Poems</span> at the age of twenty-three in 1930; it was followed in 1932 by <span style="font-style:normal">The Orators</span>. Three plays written in collaboration with Christopher Isherwood between 1935 and 1938 built his reputation as a left-wing political writer. Auden moved to the United States partly to escape this reputation, and his work in the 1940s, including the long poems "For the Time Being" and "The Sea and the Mirror", focused on religious themes. He won the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry for his 1947 long poem <span style="font-style:normal">The Age of Anxiety</span>, the title of which became a popular phrase describing the modern era.</p>
		<p>Auden was a prolific writer of prose essays and reviews on literary, political, psychological and religious subjects, and he worked at various times on documentary films, poetic plays, and other forms of performance. Throughout his career he was both controversial and influential, and critical views on his work ranged from sharply dismissive, treating him as a lesser follower of W. B. Yeats and T. S. Eliot, to strongly affirmative, as in Joseph Brodsky's claim that he had "the greatest mind of the twentieth century". After his death, his poems became known to a much wider public than during his lifetime through films, broadcasts and popular media.</p>
