night I went to the Gilded Cage with a purpose and was dressed
accordingly: blue sports jacket, slacks, loafers without socks, white
shirt open to the third button. I arrived early and found a stool at
the semi-circular bar, put a fiver on the bar for effect, ordered a
Millers High Life, lit a cigarette and looked around. The bar-stools
were almost all occupied – by men. Soon they'd be three deep, it
being Friday night. The piano was set back in an alcove to the
left-rear of the bar. It also had bar-stools around it so you could
drink there and look at the player with one elbow on the piano. Two
young couples were perched on the stools, the men in suits and ties
and the giggly women showing a lot of leg. The men were probably
asshole officers from Fort Ord, I figured. The piano player was
playing </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Calibri, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4><I>As

probably requested by one of the girls. That kind of girl always
requested that kind of song because they liked to think of themselves
as Ingrid Bergman - romantic and teary - without realizing that it
wasn't a song you could request, it had to hit you out of the blue. I
lit another cigarette and nursed my beer.<BR><br>                                                  
The Gilded Cage wasn't really my kind of place, primarily because
they only served bottled beer which cost two bits, except for
Miller's High Life, which went for thirty cents. Hell, you could get
a good glass of draft anywhere else for a dime. There were other
things I didn't like about it, such as the yellow birdcage hanging
over the bar with a live parakeet in it and the bartender wearing a
tie and garters on his sleeves. I wondered what it felt like to be a
caged bird in that dump. The whole place was like a trinket you could
buy in the five-and-ten. And the customers – mostly what
you’d call gay today but what we called something else then –
thought they were
hot shit with their sports jackets and ties and wavy hair and loud
laughs. About the only thing good about the Gilded Cage was the piano
player, who could play anything
you asked for. You had to tip him or buy him a drink every time you
made a request though, so I never requested anything because I was
only a private in the United States Army and my budget didn't include
tips, except to waitresses. In fact, I’d only been in the Gilded
Cage once before, on a payday, when I wandered in drunk without
knowing what kind of place it was. Monterey was full of cheap bars
and the only reason to go to an expensive one would be on the chance
of picking up a girl, which was damn hard in a town that had the Army
Language School right up the hill in the Presidium and Fort Ord about
five miles away. Monterey wasn't Steinbeck's Cannery Row anymore, and
it hadn't yet become a snooty extension of Carmel and Pacific Grove.
It wasn't much of anything, as far as I was concerned.<BR><BR>                                                       
&quot;Nice song,&quot; a guy said who sidled up next to me.I nodded
and looked at him in the mirror. In his thirties, I guessed,
suntanned, casually well dressed. He was smiling at my profile. &quot;And
from a nice picture,&quot; I agreed.<BR><BR>                                                       
&quot;Saw it three times myself,&quot; the guy said. &quot;You?&quot;<BR> <BR>    
                                                  &quot;About

want your drink here, Jacky?&quot; the bartender asked the
guy.<BR> <BR>                                                           &quot;Yes,
thank you, Sal.&quot;<BR>  <BR>                                                      The
bartender went to the end of the bar and came back with a glass with
an inch of whiskey and soda in it. He put a coaster in front of Jacky
and placed the drink on it. <BR> <BR>                                                       &quot;That
was hardly worth the trip, Sal,&quot; Jacky said,
grinning.<BR><BR>                                                       
Sal grinned back and went off to tend a customer. I drank down my
beer, knowing I wouldn't have to nurse it any longer. Jacky drank his
down too. &quot;Let me buy you a drink. Wouldn't you prefer scotch?&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

He held a pack of filter-tipped Parliaments, though my Marlboro's
were plainly visible on the bar. What the hell, I decided, why waste
them? and took a Parliament. Jacky's gold-plated lighter flicked open
under my nose so I didn't even have to lean forward to reach the tiny
flame. I dragged and could hardly taste the smoke. Goddam

<FONT FACE="Calibri, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>&quot;Well, I went up
to San Francisco.&quot; I didn't mention that it had been last
weekend. I had driven up alone in my 1949 Hudson Hornet the Friday
after payday, alone because I’m a loner, that's what people said
about me and I suppose it was true. I had only one real friend on the
hill in the Language School, Jim McCrea, but Jim was black which was
a big disadvantage when girls were involved. In fact it was a
disadvantage when anything was involved once you got off base. There
was no Jim Crow in California like in the South, but there was a more
subtle discrimination. Jim </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Calibri, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>and
I had driven around sightseeing and had eaten together in restaurants
and went to Shorty's bar, which was just outside the base, at least
once a week to drink ten </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Calibri, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>cent
beer and listen to jazz on the jukebox they had there and talk a lot.
But whenever there were likely looking girls in the place, which
wasn't often, I regretted being with Jim because it was impossible to
pick up a couple of white girls – and they were always in pairs –
if you were with Jim. Even if you went to town, like tonight, you
might get into trouble if some townie or redneck from Fort Ord
decided to pick a fight because Jim was black. Jim knew it, of
course, so he never went to the bars in town. I had to do that. It
was a rotten situation that I hated, but if you were after pussy that
was how it was and if I had to choose between pussy – or the chance
of it – and Jim … well, that's the way it was.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Calibri, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>It took about three
hours to get to Frisco because there was no good thruway yet. Once
there, I checked into the YMCA for three bucks a night that I paid in

walked into that bar without noticing its name – an oversight I
would eternally regret. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Calibri, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>It was about midnight
and the place was jumping. There was a rectangular bar, served by two
bartenders on all fours sides, a crowded dance floor and booths. The
first unusual thing was that there was a dance floor at all, the
second that the place was well lighted instead of half dark. It was
the antithesis of the Gilded Cage. I stood at the bar and ordered a
Bud draft. The booths ran all along the walls and I inspected them.
There were a lot of girls in the place but they were already with
guys. I regretted that I hadn't found the place sooner. Now I'd have
to try to cut someone out or wait for someone new to come in. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Calibri, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Then I spotted Olga.
Although there must have been a lot of servicemen there – we were
in the middle of the Korean War – none were in uniform except the
sailor in a funny uniform who was sitting in the booth across from
her. The sailor moved his hand brusquely and knocked over a wine
bottle. The girl tried to wipe the spilled wine with a paper napkin
while he laughed. He must have been drunk. I saw my </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Calibri, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>opportunity
and grabbed a rag from the sink below the bar and walked over to
them. &quot;You won't get it dry with that piece of paper, Miss,&quot;
I said, and wiped up the </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Calibri, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>beer.

thicker on the bridge and I drove slowly, for me, hunched over the

feeling in my stomach. I had missed the exit to Treasure Island. And
I couldn't very well make a U-turn on a bridge when I couldn't see
what might be coming from the other direction. So I had to continue
into Oakland, turn and go back over the bridge. I knew there was only
