	<p class=img>Willem Drost (baptized 19 April 1633 – buried 25 February 1659) was a Dutch Golden Age painter. He is a mysterious figure, closely associated with Rembrandt, with very few paintings clearly attributable to him. He was presumably born in Amsterdam. Around 1650, according to the early art historian Houbraken, he became a student of Rembrandt, eventually developing a close working relationship, painting history scenes, biblical compositions, symbolic studies of a solitary figure, as well as portraits. As a student, his 1654 painting titled "Bathsheba" was inspired by Rembrandt's painting done in the same year on the same subject and given the same title, though their treatments are rather different; both Drost’s and Rembrandt’s paintings are in the Louvre in Paris.
The relationship between Bathsheba and King David did not begin well, but she later became his loyal wife and mother of King Solomon, the wisest ruler of Israel. David forced Bathsheba to commit adultery with him while her husband, Uriah the Hittite, was away at war. When she became pregnant, David tried to trick Uriah into sleeping with her so it would look like the child was Uriah's. Uriah refused. David then plotted to have Uriah sent to the front lines of battle and abandoned by his fellow soldiers; Uriah was killed by the enemy. After Bathsheba finished mourning Uriah, David took her for his wife. But David's actions displeased God, and the baby born to Bathsheba died. Bathsheba bore David other sons, most notably Solomon. God so loved Solomon that Nathan the prophet called him Jedidiah, which means "beloved of Jehovah." </p>

				<p class=title2>The Military-industrial Complex and the Forces of Evil as Personified by Donald J. Trump</p>
	<a href="#"><img src=arms-triangle-small.jpg alt="Arms Triangle" style="float:left;width:40%;margin-right:10px;margin-bottom:5px;" title="Editor's Page"></a>
		<p class=text>President Dwight D. Eisenhower coined the term Military-Industrial Complex on January 17, 1961, by warning that the United States' military spending was more than that of the next thirteen countries combined. Eisenhower was no starry-eyed tree-hugger; rather was he the victorious Allied Commanding General in World War II; one could say that after years in the presidency he knew what he was talking about. But how can it be explained? At the end of the Second World War, the United States was the only one of the great powers left standing on its own feet. It had been a determining force in winning the wars against Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan, mostly because of its extraordinary industrial ability to produce weapons – including, sadly, the atomic bombs, dropped needlessly on Japan, when President Truman and his Air Force generals became mass murderers... <a href="#">Continue reading</a></p><br/>

God wills it!<br/>The War on Terror as the Launching of an American Crusade <span style="font-weight:normal;">by James Carroll</span></p>

	<p class=text>
America may be sinking ever deeper into the moral morass of the Trump era, but if you think the malevolence of this period began with him, think again. The moment I still dwell on, the moment I believe ignited the vast public disorder that is now our all-American world, has been almost completely forgotten here. And little wonder. It was no more than a casually tossed-off clichÃ©, a passing historical reference whose implications and consequences meant nothing to the speaker. "This crusade," said President George W. Bush just days after the 9/11 attacks, "this war on terrorism...<a href="carroll-crusade.html">Continue reading</a></p>

Whether the rationale is the need to wage a war on terror involving 76 countries or renewed preparations for a struggle against peer competitors Russia and China(as Defense Secretary James Mattis suggested recently while introducing America’s new National Defense Strategy), the U.S. military is engaged globally.  A network of 800 military bases spread across 172 countrieshelps enable its wars and interventions.  By the count of the Pentagon, at the end of the last fiscal year about 291,000 personnel (including reserves and Department of Defense civilians) were deployed in 183 countries worldwide, which is the functional definition of a military uncontained... <a href="#">Continue reading</a></p><br/>

Este ser no tiene corporalidad –en el sentido humano– pero es quien, en los momentos de quietud y de soledad, aparece para llenar el espacio vacío. Cuando surge una incertidumbre, él está presente. Cuando evocamos a alguien, él nos ayuda. Ahora imaginen que esos seres han llegado a la tierra hace tan sólo diez años. Y si bien las personas mayores no pueden encontrarse con ellos con mucha fluidez, los jóvenes los tienen como un aspecto central de su vida: a esos seres los llamamos teléfonos celulares inteligentes. <a href="#">Continuar leyendo</a></p><br/>

Reading and listening to music: the triumphs of being not myself. That nearly everything I admired was produced by people who were dead (or very old) or from elsewhere, ideally Europe, seemed inevitable to me. I accumulated gods. What Stravinsky was for music Thomas Mann became for literature. At my Aladdin's cave, at the Pickwick, on November 11, 1947 - taking the book down from the shelf just now, I find the date written on the flyleaf in the italic script I was then practicing - I bought The Magic Mountain. I began it that night, and for the first few nights had trouble breathing as I read. For this was not just another book I would love but a transforming book, a source of discoveries and recognitions. All of Europe fell into my head - though on condition that I start mourning for it. And tuberculosis, the faintly shameful disease (so my mother had intimated) of which my hard-to-imagine real father had died so long ago and exotically elsewhere, but which seemed, once we moved to Tucson, to be a commonplace misfortune - tuberculosis was revealed as the very epitome of pathetic and spiritual interest!<a href="sontag-mann.html">Continue reading</a></p><br/>

<p class=title2>The Catcher in the Rye <span style="font-weight:normal;">by J.D.Salinger - reviewed by S.N.Behrman</span></p>

<p class=text> 
Holden Caulfield, the sixteen-year-old protagonist of J. D. Salinger’s first novel, “The Catcher in the Rye,” which has been published by Little, Brown and chosen by the Book-of-the-Month Club, refers to himself as an illiterate, but he is a reader. One of the tests to which he puts the books he reads is whether he feels like calling the author up. He is excited about a book by Isak Dinesen and feels like calling her up. He would like to call up Ring Lardner, but an older brother has told him Lardner is dead. He thinks “Of Human Bondage” is pretty good, but he has no impulse to put in a call to Maugham. He would like to call up Thomas Hardy, because he has a nice feeling about Eustacia Vye. (Nobody, evidently, has told him the sad news about Hardy.) Mr. Salinger himself passes his unorthodox literary test with flying colors; this reader would certainly like to call him up... <a href="#">Continue reading</a></p><br/>

Dim lights, soft music. KENNETH prepares the set: a table downstage center, a chair on either side, a half-empty bottle of red wine and two glasses. JUDY, an attractive young actress, preferably black, enters with a candle, which she places on the table and lights. KENNETH pours wine into the glasses. They sit. Lights up, soft.<br/>
JUDY: So what now? I mean it's all very interesting, but so what?<br/>
KENNETH: So plenty. If Jesus Christ himself appears to you in Prospect Park it must mean something for god's sake.<br/>
	JUDY: What? ...assuming it was him.<br/>
KENNETH: That's what I'm trying to figure out.<br/>
JUDY: Is that why you disappeared without telling anyone, especially me?<br/>
KENNETH: Yes, I had to get away by myself and think.<br/>
JUDY: Where did you go?<br/>
KENNETH: Oh for god's sake, Judy, what difference does that make?<br/>
JUDY: Just asking. I'm interested in you, you know. <a href="#">Continue reading</a></p><br/>

<p class=text> 
That night I went to the Gilded Cage with a purpose and was dressed accordingly: blue sports jacket, slacks, loafers without socks, white shirt open to the third button. I arrived early and found a stool at the semi-circular bar, put a fiver on the bar for effect, ordered a Millers High Life, lit a cigarette and looked around. The bar-stools were almost all occupied - by men. Soon they'd be three deep, it being Friday night. The piano was set back in an alcove to the left-rear of the bar. It also had bar-stools around it so you could drink there and look at the player with one elbow on the piano. Two young couples were perched on the stools, the men in suits and ties and the giggly women showing a lot of leg. The men were probably asshole officers from Fort Ord, I figured. The piano player was playing As Time Goes By...<a href="love-spies.html">Continue reading</a></p><br/>

<p class=text>A beggar sat at the city's gate. He was blind. I said: Yehuda, give him something.<br/>
But Yeshua held us back: Patchwork!<br/>
The he asked the beggar, whose hand was stretched out to him: How long have you been blind, friend?<br/>
Since birth. Why do you ask?<br/>
Yeshua pulled his eyelids up and turned his face to the sun.<br/>
He's really blind, Yeshua said.<br/>
Of course I'm blind. Are you a physician?<br/>
I am one who can heal.<br/>
I pulled Yeshua's arm: Rabbi, no, not here on this hot ground! Nothing that looks like a miracle, I beg of you.<br/>
He shook off my hand: Don't you want me to help where I can?<br/>
He said to the blind man: Keep still. I'm going to rub something on your eyes, it doesn't hurt. Do you want me to cure you? Do you believe that I can?

One evening Nicky and his little sister Caroline were sitting in the meadow near their home at the edge of the forest. The sky overhead was like a cape of black silk encrusted with brilliant jewels.<br/>
"How many stars are there in the sky, Nicky", Caroline asked.<br/>
"A lot."<br/>
"Yes, I can see that, but how many?" she insisted.<br/>
"Billions. Nobody knows."<br/>
"Let's count them."<br/>
Nicky laughed. "Fine, you count them and tell me how many there are." "Let's see." Caroline stood up to be closer to the stars and began to count: "One, two, three, four, fi...Oh no, I already counted that one."<br/>
"You see, silly," Nicky said, "you'll never be able to count them. Not even scientists with telescopes can." <a href="#">Continue reading.</a></p>

<p class=text> 
In the lectures that are to follow, I shall base myself to a great extent on what you have heard me say concerning plant growth and also animal forms. We shall have to attempt to put into aphoristic form some of the spiritual scientific concepts concerning the enemies of agriculture, animal and vegetable, and the diseases of plants. These matters can only be studied in concrete cases, they must be dealt with specifically, for there is little that can be said in a general way. <a href="#">Continue reading</a></p> 

<p class=title2>The Fifth Gospel - Lecture 1 of 7 lectures <span style="font-weight:normal;">by Rudolf Steiner</span></p>

<p class=text> 	 
The theme I intend to speak about seems to me to be especially important in view of the times and conditions in which we live. I would like to emphasize from the start that it is not due to a wish for sensationalism or similar things that the theme is The Fifth Gospel. For I hope to show that, given our present circumstances, it is especially important, in the sense that is meant, that no other name is more appropriate than The Fifth Gospel. This Fifth Gospel, as you will hear it, does not yet exist in a recorded document, although in the future of humanity it will certainly exist in a specific record. But in a certain sense this Fifth Gospel is as old as the other four Gospels.
In order that I may speak about this Fifth Gospel, however, an introduction is necessary in order to clarify certain important points for a complete understanding of what we will now call the Fifth Gospel...  <a href="#">Continue reading</a></p>

<p class=title2>Foundation stone Address for the Malsch Temple and Branch</p>

<p class=text>
The following text is a portion of the talk Rudolf Steiner gave on the late evening of April 5, 1909 on the occasion of the laying of the foundation stone of the “Malsch model” during the founding of a new theosophical branch in the town of Malsch, Germany. That small building was meant as the model for a “temple” to be built later on. It was built by the student E. A. Karl Stockmeyer, who had asked Rudolf Steiner for the necessary guidelines. The basis for the model is formed by twice seven columns that support an oval-shaped cupola. The capitals of the columns form a row of carved images depicting the planetary metamorphosis of the earth's evolution. These capital drafts were used in the First Goetheanum [in Dornach]. <a href="#">Continue</a><br/><br/>
