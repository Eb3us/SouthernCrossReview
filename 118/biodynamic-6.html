shall begin with examples which, if they are taken as the
starting-point of experiments, may lead to something further. I shall
begin with the subject of weeds or noxious plants. What we have to do
is not so much to find a definition for what we mean by weeds, as to
discover how to remove such plants from a field when we do not wish
to have there. Some of us, perhaps, as a habit from our student days,
may be inclined to seek for definitions. I have given way &mdash;
although without much enthusiasm &mdash; to such an inclination and
have looked up in various books the definitions given of a weed. I
found that most authors say: &ldquo;A weed is that which grows where
it is not wanted,&rdquo; which does not go very deeply into the
essence of the matter. Nor can we very successfully apply such a
definition to the essential nature of the weed, for the simple reason
that before the tribunal of nature the weed has just as much right to
grow as plants that are useful to us. Clearly, we must approach the
matter from a somewhat different angle. We must ask ourselves how in
a particular piece of ground we can get rid of what was not meant by
us to grow there, but which nevertheless does so because of the
general aspects of nature ruling there.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

answer to this question can only be found by taking account of those
things which we have been discussing during the last few days. It was
pointed out that we must learn to distinguish those forces which
arise in the cosmos but are absorbed by the earth and work upon plant
growth from within the earth. These forces come from Mercury, Venus
and Moon and act not directly, but through the mediation of the
earth. They must be taken into account if we wish to follow up how
the mother plant gives rise to a daughter plant, and so on. On the
other hand, we must consider the forces taken by the plant from the
outer-earthly, and brought to it by way of the atmosphere from the
outer planets. Broadly speaking, we may say that the forces coming
from the nearer planets (see Lectures 2 and 3) are very much
influenced by the workings of lime in the soil, while those coming
from the distant planets fall under the influence of silicon. And, in
fact, workings of silicon, even though they proceed from the earth,
act as mediators of the forces coming from Jupiter, Mars and Saturn,
but not for those of Moon, Mercury and Venus. People are quite
unaccustomed to take these things into account. Ignorance of the
cosmic influences, whether they come through the atmosphere around
the earth, or whether they come from below through the medium of the
earth, has caused great harm. Let us take a special case to
illustrate this. The old instinctive knowledge had disappeared from
large areas of the civilised world; the soil was exhausted, and such
parts of the old traditions that the peasants had preserved was also
worn out. And so the vineyards far and wide were decimated by
Phylloxera (or grape-louse). People were powerless to cope with the
Phylloxera that was destroying the vineyards. I could tell you of an
agricultural paper that used to be published in Vienna in the
eighties. Appeals from all sides were made to the editor to supply
some remedy for Phylloxera, but to his despair he knew of none and
that was at a time when the pestilence was most acute. For the
science of today is not able to deal effectively with such evils as
these; what is needed is insight into the connections I have been
expounding to you here.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<font size=4><STYLE="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 150%">Now
I want you to imagine that Image 1 represents the earth level where
the influences of Venus, Mercury and Moon enter into the earth and
stream again from below upwards. These are the forces which cause the
plant to grow during the season, later produce the seed, and by means
of this seed a new plant, a second plant, then yet a third and so on.
(I indicate this schematically). All this goes into the force of
reproduction and streams on into the succeeding generations. The
forces, however, which take the other path, remaining above the earth
level, come from the distant planets. I can draw this schematically
in this way. These forces cause the plant either to spread into its
surroundings or to become fat and juicy, to build matter
into itself such as we can use for food because it is produced again
and again in a continuous stream. Take
for example the flesh of fruit &mdash; an apple or a plum &mdash;
which we can break off and eat; all this is due to the workings from
the distant planets.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

this we are able to see how we must proceed if we are to influence
plant-growth in one way or another. We have to take account of these
two sets of forces. A large
number of plants (and more especially those which we call weeds and
which often have powerful healing properties) are particularly
subject to the influence of the Moon. All that we know of the Moon in
the ordinary way is that the rays of the sun fall upon it and are
reflected back to the earth. And these reflected sun-rays come to the
Earth charged with lunar forces; this is so ever since the [ancient]
Moon separated from the Earth. In the cosmos these lunar forces have
a strengthening effect upon all that is earthly. When the Moon was
still united to the Earth, the Earth was much more alive, much more
fertile. Its substances were not yet so mineralised within it. But
since the Moon has separated from the Earth it strengthens those
forces of the Earth which by themselves are just sufficient to
produce growth on earth in such a way that growth is enhanced to
reproduction. When a being grows It increases in size. Hence the same
force is at work which leads to reproduction. But growth does not go
so far as to produce another being of the same kind. It is merely
that cell grows upon cell, a weaker kind of reproduction: whereas
reproduction is an enhanced growth. The Earth, with its own force,
can only be the mediator of this growth only &mdash; this weak kind
of reproduction. without the Moon it cannot control the enhanced
growth. To achieve reproduction proper it needs the cosmic forces of
the Moon which shine into the Earth sphere and in the case of some
plants, also those which come from Mercury and Venus.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

I said before, people look upon the Moon as simply reflecting the
rays of the Sun, as transmitting solar light. But that is not the
only thing which reaches the Earth. Together with the Moon's rays,
the entire cosmos is reflected upon the Earth. Everything that
affects the Moon Is reflected. And though this cannot be proved by
the usual methods of physics, the whole of the starry heavens is in a
sense reflected onto the Earth from the Moon. It is a powerful and
strongly organising cosmic force which Is poured down from the Moon
into the plant and enables it to produce seed, thus enhancing it to
reproduce. But all this can only come about at any particular spot
when the Moon is full. When the Moon is new, the area will not enjoy
the benefits of lunar Influence. During the new Moon, plants can do
no more than retain what they took In at the time when the Moon was
full. We should reach important enough results if we pursued the
custom, known in ancient India and still maintained up to the
nineteenth century, of observing the phases of the moon at seed-time
and of making use of its effects upon the very earliest stages of
germination. But Nature is not so cruel as to punish man for his
inattention and discourtesy to the Moon at times of sowing and
harvesting. We have a full Moon twelve times a year. This ensures
that the influences of the full Moon, I.e., those which promote the
formation of fruit, are there in sufficient strength. If something to
be grown is placed in the soil at new Moon instead of at full Moon,
It will wait until the Moon is again at the full phase and,
regardless of human error, work in accord with Nature. Thus people
make use of the moon without having the slightest idea that they are
doing so.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

this alone does not help us any further. For, as things are, weeds
claim the same rights as useful plants, and we get them all mixed up
together because we do not understand the forces that regulate
growth. We must try and enter into these forces. We shall then see
that the fully developed strength of the Moon promotes the
reproductive forces of all living plants, that it creates the force
which pushes upwards through the plant from the root right on into
the seed as it is being formed in the fruit. We shall get the best
possible weeds if we allow the Moon to shed its full beneficence upon
them and do nothing to stop its influence. Furthermore, in wet years,
when the lunar forces are more active than in dry weather, the weeds
will increase and multiply. If, however, we take these cosmic forces
into our calculations we shall reason as follows.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

not be able to reproduce. Since, however, we cannot screen off the
Moon, we shall have to treat the soil in such a way that It will be
disinclined to absorb lunar influences. Moreover the weeds will then
develop a certain reluctance to grow in soil that has been treated in
this way. This will give us what we want.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

must boldly take the matter in hand. We must not be afraid, and this

particular weed in question, i.e., those parts which contain within
themselves the final workings of the force of which I have been
speaking. We light a flame &mdash; that of a simple wood fire is best
&mdash; and burn the seeds, carefully collecting the ash, of which we
accumulate a relatively small quantity in this way. But in the ashes
of these seeds we have in concentrated form the force that is the
opposite of the force which was developed under the influence of the
Moon. We then sprinkle the pepper-like preparations on our fiends.
The effect spreads over a large area, so it should not be too much
work.  And we shall see in the second year that there are far fewer
weeds. After four years of this treatment, the weeds will have
completely disappeared from our field. In this way the &ldquo;Effects
of smallest Entities,&rdquo; which has been proved scientifically by
the Biological Institute at Stuttgart, is put to fruitful use. </SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT>

great many results are to be obtained In this way, as you will find
out if you really take account of these influences, which are totally
disregarded nowadays. For Instance, in order to use the dandelion in
the manner I outlined to you yesterday, you can plant a number of
them anywhere. But you can at the same time make use of the dandelion
seed for the production of this burnt pepper to be scattered on your
fields. In this way, you will be able to plant dandelions wherever
you like, but you will also ensure that the field that has been
treated in this way with dandelion ash will be free of dandelions.
All these things were contained In the old Instinctive husbandry. In
those days, one could put what plants one chose to grow together,
because one went about it with a sort of instinctive wisdom. From
what I have said, you can see that these things are the starting
point of a really practical method. And since to-day the view &mdash;
I will not call it the prejudice &mdash; obtains that everything must
be verified, I urge you to put these things to the test. If you carry
through the experiments properly, they will verify what I have said.
If, however, I myself were working on a farm, I should not wait for
proofs but go straight ahead, for I am sure that these things are
practicable. I look at It in this way: the truths of Spiritual
Science are true in themselves and require no verification from
outside or by external methods. The mistake of all our
anthroposophical scientists has been that they adopted external
methods of verification. They have done so even within the
Anthroposophical Society, where they certainly ought to have known
that things can be true in and by themselves. But If one wants to
establish any results in public nowadays, one needs external
verification: there the compromise is necessary. In actual fact it is
not necessary. For we know things Inwardly, i.e., that they are true
through their inner nature. For example: Suppose I put fifty persons
to work in manufacturing a certain material. Now, if I want three
times as much of the material made I know quite well that I should
need a hundred and fifty persons to get the job done. But a subtle
person may come along and say: &ldquo;I do not agree. You will have
to put it to the test. You will have to try it out on a given piece
of work, putting first one, then two, then three persons on it and
establish how much they do.&rdquo; Now if all three spend all their
time chattering, they will do less work than one person. The
assumption can turn out to be false, for scientific experiment has
shown results that are opposed to the assumption. But the idea is not
refuted, although the experiment has &ldquo;proved&rdquo; the
contrary. To be really exact, the falsifying factors would have to be
examined. Then what is inwardly true will also become outwardly
established.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

are able to proceed In a fairly general way as regards the noxious
plants in our fields. But we cannot speak so generally when it comes
to methods of controlling the noxious animals. I shall take an
example which will be particularly characteristic and will enable you
to make experiments and see how these things work out. Let us take an
old friend of the farmer &mdash; the field-mouse. What efforts have
not been made to combat this little creature? You can read in
agricultural works of the use of preparations made of phosphorus or
strychnine and saccharine. Even the drastic remedy of infecting the
field-mouse with typhus has been suggested, to be applied by mixing
with mashed potatoes certain bacilli harmful only to rodents, the
mixture being distributed as required. These things have been done,
or at any rate they have been recommended. In any case, all sorts of
rather inhuman methods have been tried in order to get rid of these
quite pretty-looking little animals. Even the government has taken a
hand in the struggle, because it is not of much use to fight the
field-mouse on your own land If your neighbour is not going to follow
suit. Otherwise the mice simply come across from the adjacent fields.
The government had therefore to be called in, in order to compel
everyone to get rid of their field mice by the same method.
Governments do not like exceptions. When a government selects a
method which it thinks the right one (regardless of whether It is or
not) it Issues instructions, and these have to be followed by every
farmer. All this is simply proceeding by trial and error and laying
down the law from outside. And one always experiences that those who
proceed in such a manner are never quite happy about the results, for
the mice invariably reappear. It is quite true that no method can be
entirely effective on one estate only; it can however be shown to be
partially effective on a single estate and then one must rely on
human intelligence in inducing one's neighbours to follow the same
method. For in the future people will need to rely to a far greater
extent upon reason and common sense than on police or government
regulations. That will be a first real step forward in our social
life.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

let us imagine the following. We catch a fairly young field-mouse and
skin it. The main thing is to get this skin when Venus is in the sign
of Scorpio. Those old fellows of the Middle Ages with their
instinctive wisdom were not fools after all. They pretended that in
passing from the plant to the animal kingdom, we come upon what they
called the zodiac, which means &ldquo;animal circle.&rdquo; Indeed if
one wants to exercise an influence in the plant kingdom, one can
content oneself with the use of planetary forces. But with animals
this is not enough. Here the fixed stars have to be taken into
account, especially those fixed stars which belong to the signs of
the Zodiac. In the plant kingdom the influence of the Moon is
sufficient to call forth the powers of reproduction. In the animal
kingdom the Moon's Influence must be strengthened by that of Venus.
Indeed in this case the influence of the Moon need not be especially
taken into account because the animal kingdom has retained within
itself Moon forces and has thus emancipated itself from the actual
Moon. In the animal kingdom lunar forces are at work even when the
Moon is not full. The animal bears the full Moon within Itself and is
therefore emancipated from time conditions. There is, however, a
dependence as regards the other planetary influences. We have to
undertake something quite definite with the skins of the mice in
connection with these. The skin must be secured at the time when
Venus stands in the sign of Scorpio, then burned and the ash and any
residue carefully collected. Several skins must be burnt to procure a
sufficient quantity of ash. Now because the skins have been burnt
when Venus was in Scorpio, that which is contained in these ashes is
the negative force to the power of reproduction in the field-mouse.
If, in certain districts, difficulties present themselves, a more
homoeopathic method can be adopted to procure this pepper-like
substance. If, however, it has been obtained during the conjunction
of Venus and Scorpio it will, when sprinkled on your fields, prove to
be a means of keeping field-mice away. No doubt they are cheeky
little creatures and are apt to come back again if &ldquo;pepperless&rdquo;
areas still remain in the neighbourhood. In such areas the mice will
again settle down. But if the method is applied throughout the
neighbourhood it certainly brings about a radical result.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

the morning. Now we must clearly realise the following facts: the
leaves, the middle part of the plant which undergo these changes,
absorb cosmic Influences that come from the surrounding air, whereas
the roots absorb the forces which have entered into the earth and are
reflected upwards Into the plant. What, then, takes place when the
nematode occurs? It is this: The process of absorption which should
actually reside In the region of the leaves has been pressed
downwards and embraces the roots.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

If this (Image 2) represents the earth level, and this the plant,
then in the plant infested with the nematode the forces which should
be active above the horizontal line are actually at work below it.
What happens Is that certain cosmic forces slide down to a deeper
level; hence the change in the external appearance of the plant. But
this also makes It possible for the parasite to obtain under the soil
(which Is its proper habitat) those cosmic forces which it must have
to sustain itself. The nematode Is a wire-like worm. Otherwise it
would be forced to seek for these forces in the region of the leaves;
this, however, it cannot do as the soil is Its proper environment.
Some, Indeed all living beings can only live within certain limits of
existence. Just try to live in an atmosphere 70 degrees above or 70
degrees below zero and you will see what will happen. You are
constituted to live in a certain temperature, neither above nor below
it. The nematode is in the same position. It cannot live without
earth and without the presence of certain cosmic forces brought down
into it. Without these two conditions it would die out.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

living being is subject to quite definite conditions. And for the
particular beings with which we are dealing it is important that
cosmic forces should enter the earth, forces which would ordinarily
display themselves only in the atmosphere around the earth. Actually
the workings of these forces have a four-year rhythm. Now in the case
of the nematode, we have something very abnormal. If one enquires
into these forces, one finds that they are the same as those at work
on the cockchafer grubs; and also those which bestow on the earth the
faculty of bringing the seed potato to development. Cockchafer grubs
as well as seed potatoes are bred by the same forces, and these
forces recur every four years. This four-yearly cycle is what must be
taken into account, not with regard to the nematode, but with regard
to the steps we take to combat it.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

this case, the procedure Is not to take any particular part of the
animal as we did with the field-mouse, but the whole animal must be
taken. This insect, which attacks the roots of the plant, is as a
whole a product of cosmic Influences, needing the soil only as a
medium. Thus the whole insect must be burnt. That is the best and quickest method. A
more thorough way might be to allow it to decay, but then it would be
difficult to collect the remains, and practically the same result can
be obtained by burning the whole insect. The insect can be collected
and kept alive and then burnt at the proper time. The incineration
must take place when the Sun is in the constellation of Taurus i.e.,
the constellation exactly opposite to that which was mentioned in
connection with Venus and the burning of the mice skins. For this
insect world is closely related to the forces that are developed as
the Sun, on its path through the Zodiac, passes from the sign of
Aquarius through Pisces to Aries and Gemini and on to Cancer. In the
sign of Cancer the influence becomes quite weak; it is weak, too, in
the sign of Aquarius. As the Sun goes through these signs,  the first
and last being the weakest, it radiates those forces which are
connected with the insect world. </SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT>

&ldquo;Wisdom of the Stars.&rdquo; Modern astronomy only serves as a
means of mathematical orientation, and cannot really be put to any
other use. But astronomy was not always like this; the stars once
served as a guide for the labours and activities of life on earth.
This science has now been completely lost. But to the extent to which
we can develop a new science we have the possibility of controlling
those animals and insects which become a nuisance. It all depends on
our capacity to be on such intimate terms with the earth that we come
to know her capacity for bringing forth plants, especially through
the power of lunar and water influences. But the forces in
every plant and in every other being carry in themselves the germ of
their own destruction. Thus, just as on the one hand water is a
promoter of fruitfulness, so on the other hand fire is the destroyer
of fruitfulness. It consumes it. And If instead of treating plants
with water, which is the usual way of making them fruitful, you treat
them with fire applied in an appropriate manner, then you are
performing within the economy of Nature an act of annihilation. This
is the point to be borne in mind: a seed develops fruitfulness and
spreads it abroad through the Moon-saturated water. It also
develops destructive forces through the Moon saturated fire, or,
strictly speaking, as we saw in our last example, through cosmically
saturated fire. There Is nothing very strange about this: we are
reckoning here with enormous forces of expansion and have given exact
indications of how time cooperates; for the seminal power is notably
active in expanding, and so if it is destroyed, it also works very
far afield. The force of expansion is peculiar to the seed. And the
burnt substance which because of its appearance we called pepper,
also possesses the tendency to spread its power abroad.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

we come later on to discuss the animal kingdom, we shall see this
difference more clearly. Above all, they are not processes such as
take place in a sick human being. For actual disease is not possible
without the presence of an astral body. In man and animals the astral
body is connected with the physical body through the etheric body and
a certain connection is the normal state. Sometimes, however, the
connection between the astral body and the physical body (or one of
the physical organs) is closer than would normally be the case; so if
the etheric body does not form a proper cushion between them, the
astral intrudes itself too strongly into the physical body. It is
from this that most diseases arise.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

the plant does not actually possess an astral body of its own. It
does not therefore suffer from the specific forms of disease that
occur in men and animals. This is the first point. The next point is
to ascertain what actually causes the plant to be diseased. From
everything I have said on this subject, you will have gathered that
the soil immediately surrounding a plant has a definite life of its
own. These life forces are there and with them all kinds of forces of
growth and tender forces of propagation not strong enough to produce
the plant form Itself, but still waiting with a certain intensity;
and in addition all the forces working in the soil under the
influence of the moon and mediated through water. Thus certain
important connections emerge.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

the first place you have the earth, the earth saturated with water.
Then you have the moon. The moonbeams, as they stream into the earth,
awaken it to a certain degree of life, they arouse waves and weaving
in the earth's etheric element. The moon can do this more easily when
the earth is permeated with water, less easily when the earth is dry.
Thus the water acts only as a mediator. What has to be quickened is
the earth itself, the solid mineral element. Water, too, is something
mineral. There is no sharp boundary, of course. In any case, we must
have lunar influences at work in the earth. Now these lunar
influences can become too strong. Indeed this may happen in a very
simple manner. Consider what happens when a very wet spring follows
upon a very wet winter. The lunar force enters too strongly into the
earth, which thus becomes too much alive. </SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT>

strongly vitalised by the moon, the plants growing upon it would
follow the normal development from seed to fruit; there would be just
the right amount of lunar force distributed in the earth to work
upwards and produce the requisite fruit-seed. But let us suppose that
the lunar influence is too strong &mdash; that the earth is too
powerfully vitalised &mdash; then the forces working upwards become
too strong, and what should happen in the seed formation occurs
earlier. Through their very intensity the forces do not proceed far
enough to reach the higher parts of the plant, but become active
earlier and at a lower level. The lunar influence has the result that
there is not sufficient strength for seed formation. The seed
receives a certain portion of the decaying life, and this decaying
life forms another level above the soil level. This new level is not
soil, but the same influences are at work there. The result is that
the seed of the plant, the upper part of the plant becomes a kind of
soil for other organisms; parasites and fungoid formations appear in
it. It is in this way that blights and similar ills make their
appearance in the plant. It is through a too strong working of the
moon that forces working upward from the earth are prevented from
reaching their proper height. The powers of fertilisation and
fructification depend entirely upon a normal amount of lunar
influence. It is a curious fact that abnormal developments should be
caused not by a weakening but by an increase of lunar forces.
Speculation might well lead to the opposite conclusion. Looking at it
in the right way shows that the matter is as I have presented it.

This is done by making a fairly concentrated brew (or tea) of
equisetum arvense (horse-tail), diluting it and using it as a liquid
manure on the fields for the purpose of fighting blight and similar
plant diseases. Here again only small quantities are required; a
homeopathic dose is generally sufficient. As you will have realised,
this is precisely where one sees how one department of life affects
another. If, without indulging in undue speculation, we realise the
noteworthy effects produced by equisetum arvense upon the human
organism by affecting the function of the kidneys, we shall have, a

if one gains an inside knowledge of the workings of Nature in her
different fields, we can actually gain control over the processes of
growth; and we shall see later that this also applies to the forces
of growth in animals both in normal and abnormal conditions. Thus we
arrive at an actual science. For to experiment and to proceed by
trial and error as people do nowadays is not true science; it is
merely collecting data and isolated facts. True science does not
begin until one has gained control of the forces at work. Now plants
and animals and even the parasites In plants cannot be understood by
themselves. Remember what I said in the first lecture about the
magnetic needle and the folly of regarding the fact of its always
pointing to the North as being caused by something in the needle
itself. No one believes this. We take the earth as a whole and assign
to it a magnetic North pole and a magnetic South pole. In the same
way, when we want to explain the plant we must bring into question
not only plant, animal and human life, but the whole universe. For
life comes from the whole of the universe, not only from the earth.
Nature is a unity and her forces are at work from all sides. He who
can keep his mind open to the manifest working of these forces will
understand her. But what does the scientist do today? He takes a
little plate, lays a preparation upon it, isolates it very carefully
and then watches. Everything that could work upon the substance is
shut off. This is called Microscopic Research. It is really the
opposite procedure to that which should be adopted in order to gain
understanding of the expanses of the world. 
<p><center><img src="agri-course6-img-4.jpg"><br>Image 4</center></p>
Not content with shutting
himself up in a room, the scientist actually shuts himself up inside
these brass tubes and leaves Nature outside. Nothing, he maintains,
must be kept under observation except the one object in question. In
this way we have yielded more and more ground to the microscope.
When, however, we find a way back to the macrocosm, then we shall
begin to understand Nature and many other things as well.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
