<p>Dear Mary Dugan:</p>
<p>Thank you for your recent letter to the Southern Cross Review about my article about Donald Trump, which was forwarded to me by the editor.</p>
<p>I am happy to hear about your work in the 1980s on behalf of Nicaragua. I, too, was thrilled when the Sandinistas ousted Somoza and I was very supportive of the Sandinista social programs in the 1980s.</p>
<p>And that is precisely why I feel it is so important to call out Daniel Ortega right now and voice my support for all the Sandinistas that he has thrown in jail or forced into exile. These include his former Vice President Sergio Ramirez who fled to Spain after the government tried to arrest him. Those who were not so lucky and are now in prison include former Sandinistas Hugo Torres, who freed Ortega from prison back in 1974, and Dora Tellez, who as health minister set up the health programs that you and I so admired in the 1980s.</p>
<p>Ortega broke with his former colleagues to make alliances with right-wing politicians, powerful business interests, and the Catholic Church. At this point, he governs from the far right, not the left. I would recommend that you read <a href="https://nacla.org/ortega-elections-sandinistas-fsln">this article</a>in NACLA, which has long been a reliable left-wing publication covering developments in Latin America.</p>
<p>If you care about Nicaragua and preserving the real legacy of the Sandinistas, I would urge you to take a fresh look at what Daniel Ortega is doing in Nicaragua.</p>
<p>"Vulgar and vicious" is actually an understatement when looking at how he has unraveled the Sandinista programs in order to serve his own thirst for power.</p>
<p>all the best,</p>
<p>John</p>
