<p class="intro"><span style="font-size:0.5em">S</span>he sat at the back and they said she was shy,<br />
She led from the front and they hated her pride,<br />
They asked her advice and then questioned her guidance,<br />
They branded her loud, then were shocked by her silence,</p>
<p>When she shared no ambition they said it was sad,<br />
So she told them her dreams and they said she was mad,<br />
They told her they'd listen, then covered their ears,<br />
And gave her a hug while they laughed at her fears,</p>
<p>And she listened to all of it thinking she should,<br />
Be the girl they told her to be best as she could,<br />
But one day she asked what was best for herself,<br />
Instead of trying to please everyone else,</p>
<p>So she walked to the forest and stood with the trees,<br />
She heard the wind whisper and dance with the leaves,<br />
She spoke to the willow, the elm and the pine,<br />
And she told them what she'd been told time after time,</p>
<p>She told them she felt she was never enough,<br />
She was either too little or far far too much,<br />
Too loud or too quiet, too fierce or too weak,<br />
Too wise or too foolish, too bold or too meek,</p>
<p>Then she found a small clearing surrounded by firs,<br />
And she stopped...and she heard what the trees said to her,<br />
And she sat there for hours not wanting to leave,<br />
For the forest said nothing, it just let her breathe.</p>
