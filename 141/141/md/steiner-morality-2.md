### Lecture Two of three

Norrköping, May 28, 1912 -- GA155\
Translated by M. Cotterell

**I** remarked yesterday that what we have to say on the subject of
anthroposophical moral principles and impulses will be based upon
facts, and for this reason we brought forward a few facts in which
moral impulses are pre-eminently exhibited.

It is, indeed, most striking and illuminating that in the case of a
personality such as Francis of Assisi mighty moral impulses must
have been active in order that he could perform his deeds. What sort
of deeds were they? They were such that what they reveal is moral in
the very highest sense of the word. Francis of Assisi was surrounded
by people afflicted with very serious diseases for which the rest of
the world at that time knew no cure. Moral impulses were so powerful
in him that many lepers through him were given spiritual aid and
great comfort. It is true that many could gain no more --- but there
were many others who by their faith and trust attained a stage when
the moral impulses and forces which poured forth from Francis of
Assisi had even a healing, health-giving effect.

In order to penetrate still more deeply into the question whence do
moral impulses come, we must inquire in the case of such an
exceptional personality as Francis of Assisi as to how he could
develop them, and what had really happened in his case. We shall
have to look more deeply if we want to understand what was active in
the soul of this outstanding human being.

Let us go back to the ancient civilization of India. In that
civilization there were certain divisions of the people; they were
divided into four castes, the highest of them being the Brahmins,
who cultivated wisdom. The separation of the castes in ancient India
was so strict that, for example, the sacred books might only be read
by the Brahmins and not by members of the other castes. The members
of the second caste, the Warrior caste, were only allowed to hear
the teachings contained in the Vedas or in the epitome of the Vedas
--- the Vedanta. The Brahmins alone were allowed to explain any
passage from the Vedas or have an opinion as to their meaning and it
was strictly forbidden for all other people to have any opinion on
the treasure of wisdom which was contained in the sacred books. The
second caste consisted of those who had to cultivate the profession
of war and the administration of the country. Then there was a third
caste which had to foster trades, and a fourth, a labouring caste.
And last of all, an utterly despised part of the population, the
Pariahs, who were looked down upon so much that a Brahmin felt he
was contaminated if he so much as stepped upon the shadow thrown by
such a one. He even had to perform certain rites of purification if
he had touched the shadow of such an outcast as a Pariah was
considered to be. Thus we see how the whole nation was divided into
four recognized castes and one that was absolutely unrecognized
Though these regulations may now be considered severe they were most
strictly observed in ancient India. Even at the time of the
Graeco-Latin civilization in Europe, no one belonging to the Warrior
caste in India would have ventured to have his own independent
opinion about what was in the sacred books, the Vedas. Now, how
could such divisions as these have arisen amongst mankind? It is
certainly remarkable that we should find these castes exactly in the
most outstanding people of human antiquity and in the very people
who had wandered over to Asia from Atlantis at a comparatively early
date and also precisely those amongst whom were preserved the
greatest wisdom and treasures of knowledge from the old Atlantean
epoch. This seems very remarkable, and how can we understand it? It
almost seems as if it contradicted all the wisdom and goodness in
the order of the universe, in the guidance of the world, that one
caste, one group of people should be separated off, who alone were
to preserve what was looked upon as the highest possessions and that
the others should be destined from the very beginning, by the mere
fact of their birth, to occupy subordinate positions.

This can only be understood by an examination into the secrets of
existence. Development is only possible through differentiation,
through organization; and if all men had wished to arrive at the
degree of wisdom reached in the Brahmin caste not a single one would
have been able to achieve it. If all human beings do not attain to
the highest wisdom, one may not say that it is a contradiction of
the Divine regulation of the world, for this would have no more
sense than if someone were to demand of the infinitely wise and
infinitely mighty Deity that He should make a triangle with four
angles. No god could make a triangle other than with three angles.
That which is ordered and determined inwardly in spirit must also be
observed by the divine regulation of the world, and just as the laws
concerning the limits of space are strict, for example, that a
triangle can only have three angles, so also if is a strict law that
development must come about through differentiation, that certain
groups of people must be separated in order that a particular
quality of human nature can be developed. To this end the others
must be excluded for a time. This is not only a law for development
of mankind, it is a law for the whole of evolution.

Consider the human form. You will at once admit that the most
valuable parts in the human form are the bones of the head. But by
what means could these particular bones become bones of the head and
envelop the higher organ, the brain? As far as the rudiments are
concerned, each bone that man possesses could become skull-bone, but
in order that a few of the bones of the whole skeleton could reach
this height of development and become bones of the forehead or of
the back part of the head, the hip bones or the joints had to stop
at a lower stage of development --- for the hip bones or the joints
have within them the possibility of becoming skull bones, just as
much as those which actually have done so. It is the same everywhere
throughout the world. Progress is only possible in evolution through
one remaining behind and another pushing forward, even beyond a
certain point of development. In India the Brahmins passed beyond a
certain average of development, but on the other hand the lower
castes remained behind it.

When the Atlantean catastrophe took place, great bodies of people
gradually wandered from Atlantis, that ancient continent which lay
where the Atlantic Ocean is today, towards the East, and peopled the
continents now known as Europe, Asia and Africa. We shall not at
present consider the few who went westward, whose descendants were
found in America by its discoverers. When the Atlantean catastrophe
took place, the body of people which then migrated towards the East
did not consist merely of the four castes which settled down in
India and there gradually differentiated themselves, but there were
seven castes, and the four which appeared in India were the four
higher castes. Besides the fifth, which was completely despised and
which in India formed, as it were, an intermediate body of the
population, besides these Pariahs there were other castes which did
not accompany them as far as India, but remained behind in various
parts of Europe, Asia Minor and especially Africa. Only the more
highly developed castes reached India, and those who remained in
Europe had entirely different qualities.

Indeed, one can only understand what took place later in Europe when
one knows that the more advanced sections of humanity in those days
reached Asia, and that in Europe, forming the main body of the
population left behind, were those who furnished the possibility for
very special incarnations. If we wish to understand the special
incarnations of souls in the most ancient European times in the
general mass of the population we must take into account a
remarkable event which took place in the Atlantean epoch. At a
certain stage in Atlantean development great secrets of existence
were betrayed; these were great truths, concerning life, which are
of infinitely greater importance than all those to which
post-Atlantean humanity has since attained. It was essential that
this knowledge should have been limited to small circles, but owing
to the violation of the mysteries, great bodies of the Atlantean
population became possessed of occult knowledge for which they were
not yet ripe. In consequence of this, their souls were at that time
driven, as one might say, into a condition which was a moral
descent, so that there remained on the path of goodness and virtue
only those who later went over to Asia.

You must not, however, imagine that the whole population of Europe
consisted only of people in whose souls were individuals who through
being misled in the Atlantean epoch had suffered a moral downfall.
Here and there in this European population were others who during
the great emigration to Asia had remained behind to act as leaders.
Thus, all over Europe, Asia Minor and Africa there were people who
simply belonged to castes or races providing the requisite
conditions for misguided souls to live in their bodies, and there
were also other better and more highly developed souls who remained
behind to guide those who did not go on to Asia.

The best places for these souls who had to assume the leadership at
that time --- in the age in which the Indian and Persian
civilizations developed --- were the more northerly parts of Europe,
the regions where the oldest mysteries of Europe have flourished.
They had a kind of protective arrangement as regards what had
previously taken place in old Atlantis. In Atlantis temptation came
to the souls described, through wisdom, mysteries and occult truths
being given them for which they were not ready. Therefore in the
European Mysteries the treasures of wisdom had to be guarded and
protected all the more. For this reason the true leaders in Europe
in post-Atlantean times withdrew themselves entirely and they
preserved what they had received as a strict secret.

We may say that in Europe also there were persons who might be
compared with the Brahmins of Asia, but these European Brahmins were
not outwardly known as such by anyone. In the strictest sense of the
word they kept the sacred secrets absolutely secluded in the
Mysteries, that there might be no repetition of what had once taken
place in the Atlantean epoch among the souls whom they were now
leading onward. Only through Wisdom being protected and most
carefully guarded did it come about that these souls were able to
uplift themselves; for differentiation does not take place in such a
way that a certain portion of humanity is destined from the
beginning to take a lower rank than another, but that which is made
lower at a certain time is to develop higher again at another
period. But the conditions must be formed for this end to be
attainable. Hence it came about that in Europe there were souls who
had fallen into temptation and had become immoral, but they were now
guided according to wisdom which proceeded from deeply hidden
sources.

Now, the other castes who had gone to India had also left members
behind in Europe. The members of the second Indian caste --- the
Warrior caste --- were those who then chiefly attained to power in
Europe. Whereas the wise teachers --- that is, those who
corresponded to the Indian Brahmins --- entirely withdrew, and gave
their counsels from hidden sanctuaries, the Warriors came out among
the people in order to improve and uplift them according to the
counsels of those ancient European priests. It was this second caste
that wielded the greatest power in Europe in primeval times, but in
their way of life they were guided by the wise teachers who remained
hidden. Thus it came about that the leading personalities in Europe
were those who shone by virtue of the qualities of which we spoke
yesterday --- valour and bravery. Whereas in India, wisdom was held
in the highest esteem and the Brahmins were revered because they
explained the sacred writing; in Europe bravery and valour were the
most valued and the people only knew of the divine mysteries through
those who were filled with valour and bravery. The civilization of
Europe continued under these influences for thousands of years and
gradually souls were improved and uplifted. In Europe, where souls
existed who were the successors of the people who had undergone
temptation, no real appreciation of the caste system of India could
develop. The souls were mingled and interwoven. A division, a
differentiation into castes such as existed in India did not arise.
The division was rather between those who guided in an upper class,
who acted as leaders in various directions, and the class that was
led. The latter consisted principally of souls who had to struggle
upward.

When we look for the souls which gradually struggled upwards out of
this lower class, and which by being tempted developed higher, we
find them chiefly in a part of the European population of which
modern history tells but little. Century after century this people
developed in order to rise to a higher stage, to recover again, as
it were, from the heavy setback the souls had received in the
Atlantean epoch. In Asia there was a continuation in the progress of
civilization; in Europe, on the other hand, there was a change from
the former moral collapse into a gradual moral improvement.

The people in Europe remained in this condition for a long time, and
improvement only came about through the existence of a strong
impulse in these souls to imitate what they saw before them. Those
who lived and worked among the people as the braver among them were
looked up to as ideals and patterns, as leaders or chiefs, they were
those who were called Fürsten (princes) and were imitated by the
people at large. Thus the morality of the whole of Europe was raised
through those souls mingling as leaders amongst the people.

Thereby something else became necessary in European development. If
we wish to understand this, we must distinguish between the
development of a single soul and that of a whole race. The two must
not be confused. A human soul can develop in such a way that in one
incarnation it embodies itself in a particular race. If in this race
it gains certain qualities, it may re-embody itself in a later
incarnation in an entirely different one; so that we may find
incarnated in Europe at the present day souls which in a previous
incarnation were embodied in India, Japan or China. The souls do not
by any means remain in the same race, for soul development is quite
different from race development, which goes its peaceful way
forward.

In ancient times, souls who were unable to go over into the Asiatic
races, were transposed into European ones, and were obliged to
incarnate again and again in them. But as they became better and
better, this led to their gradually passing on into the higher
races; and souls which were previously embodied in quite subordinate
races developed to a higher stage, and were able later to
reincarnate in the bodily successors of the leading population of
Europe. These bodily successors of the leading population
multiplied, and as these souls increased in number in this
direction, they became more numerous than they originally were.
After having progressed and improved, they incarnated in the leading
population of Europe, and the development then took place in such a
way that, on the whole, as a physical race, the bodily forms in
which the most ancient European population had originally incarnated
died out; the souls forsook the bodies which were formed in a
certain way, and which then died out. The offspring of the lower
races decreased in number while the higher increased until gradually
the lowest classes of the European population completely die out.
This is a definite process, which we must grasp. The souls develop
further, the bodies die out. For this reason we must be careful to
distinguish between soul development and race development. The souls
reappear in the bodies belonging to higher races. the lower race
bodies die out. A process such as this does not take place without
effect. When over large areas something disappears, it does not
disappear into nothing, but it dissolves and then exists in a
different form. When in ancient times the worst part of the
population of which I have just now spoken, died out, the whole
region became gradually inhabited by demons, representing the
products of dissolution, the products of the putrefaction of that
which had died out.

Thus the whole of Europe and Asia Minor were filled with the
spiritualised products of putrefaction from the worst part of the
population which had died out. These demons of putrefaction endured
for a long time, and later they acted upon mankind. It came about
that these demons of putrefaction which were incorporated in the
spiritual atmosphere, as it were, gained influence upon human beings
and affected them in such a way that their feelings were permeated
by them. The effect may be seen from the following example: ---When
at a later date, at the time of the Migration of the Peoples, great
bodies of people came over from Asia to Europe, amongst them came
Attila with his hordes. His invasion was the cause of great terror
to many of those who lived in Europe and through this state of
terror people laid themselves open to the demoniacal influences
still persisting. Gradually through these demoniacal beings there
developed --- as a consequence of the terror produced by the hordes
coming over from Asia --- that which appeared as leprosy, the
epidemic disease of the Middle Ages. This disease was nothing else
than the consequence of the state of terror and fear experienced by
the people at that time. But the terror and fear could only lead to
this result in the souls which had been exposed to the demoniacal
forces of former times.

I have now described to you why it was possible for people to be
laid hold of by a disease --- which was later practically
exterminated in Europe --- and why it was so widespread at the time
we mentioned in our last lecture. In Europe the peoples which had to
die out because they had not developed upwards became extinct, but
the after-effect was seen in the form of diseases which attacked
mankind. The disease we have mentioned, leprosy, is thus seen to be
the result of spiritual and psychic causes.

This whole condition was now to be counteracted. Further development
could only come about if that which has just been described was
entirely removed from Europe. An example of how it was taken away
was described in the last lecture, where we showed that while, on
the one hand, the after-effects of what was immoral existed as
demons of disease, on the other hand strong moral impulses appeared,
as in Francis of Assisi. Through his possession of strong moral
impulses he gathered others around him who acted also in the same
way as he, although in a lesser degree. Really there were very many
who at that time worked as he did, but this activity did not last
very long.

Now how had such a soul-power come into Francis of Assisi? As we are
not gathered together to study external science, but to understand
human morality from its spiritual and occult foundations, we must
examine a few occult or spiritual truths. Let us inquire: Whence
really came such a soul as that of Francis of Assisi? We can only
understand such a soul as this if we investigate it a little; if we
take the trouble to find what was hidden in its depths.

I must remind you that the old division into castes in India really
received its first blow, its first shock, through Buddhism, for
among many other things which Buddhism introduced into Asiatic life
was the idea that it did not recognize the division into castes as
something justifiable; that as far as it was possible in Asia it
recognized the power of each human being to attain to the highest
possible to man. We know too that this was only possible through the
eminently great and mighty individuality of Buddha. We also know
that Buddha became a Buddha in the incarnation of which we are
usually told and that in the earlier part of his life he was a
Bodhisattva, which represents the stage next below Buddhahood.
Through the fact that this son of King Suddodana, in the
twenty-ninth year of his life, experienced and felt deeply in
himself the great truth of life and sorrow, he had attained the
greatness to announce in Asia the teaching known as Buddhism.

Connected with this development of the Bodhisattva up to Buddha,
there was something else of which we must not lose sight, namely,
the fact that the individuality which had passed through many
incarnations as Bodhisattva and then risen to the rank of Buddha,
when it became Buddha had to dwell for the last time in a physical
body on earth. Thus he who is raised from Bodhisattva to Buddha
enters into an incarnation which for him is the last. From this time
onward, such an individuality only acts down from spiritual heights,
he still actss, but only spiritually. Thus we now have the fact that
the individuality of Buddha has only worked down from spiritual
heights since the fifth century before Christ.

But, Buddhism continued. It was able to influence in a certain way
not only Asiatic life, but the spiritual life of the whole of the
then known world. You know how Buddhism spread in Asia. You know how
great is the number of its followers there. But in a more hidden and
veiled form it also spread into the mental life of Europe; and we
have particularly to point out that the portion of the great
teaching of Buddha relating to the equality of man was especially
acceptable to the population of Europe, because this population was
not arranged on the plan of caste divisions, but rather upon the
idea of the equality of all human beings. On the shores of the Black
Sea there existed an occult school which lasted far into the
Christian era. This school was guided by certain human beings who
set themselves as their highest ideal that part of the teaching of
Buddha which we have just described, and through their having taken
into themselves the Christian impulse along with it, were able in
the early centuries of Christianity to throw new light upon what
Buddha had given to humanity. If I were to describe to you this
occult school on the Black Seas as the occultist or spiritual
investigator sees it --- and you will understand me best if I do
this --- I must do it in the following manner: ---

People who had external teachers in the physical world, came
together there. They were instructed in the doctrines and principles
which had proceeded from Buddhism, but they were permeated by the
impulses which came into the world through Christianity. Then, after
the pupils had been sufficiently prepared, they were brought to
where the deeper forces lying within them, the deeper forces of
wisdom, could be brought forth, so that they were led to clairvoyant
vision of the spiritual world and were able to see into the
spiritual worlds. The first thing attained by the pupils of this
occult school, was, for example, the recognition of those who no
longer descended to the physical plane. But this they could only do
after they had been accustomed to it by the teachers incarnated in
the physical body. In this way they came to know Buddha. Thus, these
occult pupils learned to know Buddha face to face, if one may so
speak of his spiritual being. In this way he continued to work
spiritually in the occult pupils and thus his power worked down to
the physical plane, although he himself no longer descended to
physical embodiment in the physical world.

Now the pupils in this occult school were grouped according to their
maturity into two unequal divisions, and only the more advanced were
chosen for the smaller division. Most of these pupils were able to
become so clairvoyant that they came in touch with a being who
strove with all his might to bring his impulses through to the
physical world, and although he himself did not descend into this
world they learned all the secrets of Buddha and all that he wished
to have accomplished. Most of these pupils remained as such,
clairvoyants, but there were some who, in addition to the qualities
of knowledge and of psychic clairvoyance, had developed the
spiritual element to a remarkable degree, which cannot be separated
from a certain humility, a certain highly evolved capacity for
devotion. These, then, attained to where they could receive the
Christ-impulse in an advanced degree precisely in this occult
school. They could also become clairvoyant in such a way that they
became the specially chosen followers of Saint Paul and received the
Christ-impulse directly in life.

Thus from this school proceeded two groups, as it were, one group
which possessed the impulse to carry the teaching of Buddha
everywhere, although his name was not mentioned in connection with
it, and a second group which, in addition, received the
Christ-impulse. Now the difference between these two kinds did not
appear very strongly in that particular incarnation, it only
appeared in the next. The pupils who had not received the
Christ-impulse but who had only gained the Buddha-impulse, became
the teachers of the equality and brotherhood of man; on the other
hand the pupils who had also received the Christ-impulse, in the
next incarnation were such that this Christ-impulse worked up
further so that not only could they teach (and they did not consider
this their chief task) but they worked more especially through their
moral power.

One such pupil of the occult school on the Black Sea, was born in
his next incarnation as Francis of Assisi. No wonder, then, that in
him there was the wisdom which he had received, the knowledge of the
brotherhood of mankind, of the equality of all men, of the necessity
to love all men equally, no wonder that this teaching pulsated
through his soul and also that his soul was permeated and
strengthened by the Christ-impulse.

Now how did this Christ-impulse work further in his next
incarnation? It acted in such a way that, when in his next
incarnation Francis of Assisi was transposed into a community in
which the old demons of diseases were especially active --- this
Christ-impulse approached the evil substance of the disease-demons
through him, and absorbed it into itself, thus removing it from
mankind. Before this, however, the Christ-impulse incorporated
itself in this substance in such a way that it first became visible
to Francis of Assisi in the vision in which he saw the palace when
he was called upon to take upon himself the burden of poverty. The
Christ-impulse had here revived in him and streamed forth from him,
and laid hold of these disease-demons. His moral forces thereby
became so strong that they could remove the harmful spiritual
substances which had produced the disease. It was through this alone
that the power was produced to bring to a higher development what I
have described to you as the after-effect of the old Atlantean
element, to purify Europe from these substances and sweep them away
from the earth.

Consider the life of Francis of Assisi; notice what a remarkable
course it took. He was born in the year 1182. We know that the first
years of the life of a human being are devoted principally to the
development of the physical body. In the physical body is developed
chiefly that which comes to light through external heredity. Hence
there appeared in him first of all that which originated through
external heredity from the European population. These qualities
gradually came out, as his etheric body developed from the seventh
to the fourteenth year, like any other human being. In this etheric
body appeared primarily that quality which as the Christ-impulse had
worked directly in him in the mysteries on the Black Sea. From his
fourteenth year, at the dawn of his astral life the Christ power
became particularly active within him, in such a way that there
entered into his astral body that which had been in connection with
the atmosphere of the earth since the Mystery of Golgotha. For
Francis of Assisi was a personality who was permeated by the
external power of Christ, owing to his having sought for the Christ
power in his previous incarnation, in that particular place of
initiation where it was to be found.

Thus we see how differentiations act in humanity, for
differentiation must come about. For that which by earlier events
has been thrust down to a lower condition is raised up once more
through special events in the course of human development. On
another occasion a particularly important uplifting took place in
the evolution of humanity, one which exoterically will always be
incomprehensible; for this reason people have really ceased to
reflect upon it, but esoterically it can be fully explained. There
were some who had developed very quickly from the strata of the
Western population, who had gradually wrestled their way up from the
lowest rungs of the ladder, but who had not risen very high in
intellectual development, but had remained comparatively humble and
simple men, chosen ones as it were, who could only be uplifted at a
certain time by a mighty impulse which reflected itself in them;
these were those who are described as the twelve Apostles of Jesus.
They were the cast-off extract of the lower castes which did not
reach India. From them had to be taken the substance for the
disciples of Christ Jesus.\*

\[We are not here referring to previous or succeeding incarnations
of the individualities of the Apostles, but solely to the physical
ancestry of the bodies in which the personalities of the Apostles
were incarnated. The succession of incarnations and the physical
line of heredity must always be distinguished.\]

Thus we have discovered the source of the moral power in that chosen
personality, Francis of Assisi. Do not say that taking ordinary
human rules into consideration, it would be too-much to expect a
person to realise the ideals manifested in Francis of Assisi.
Certainly what I have said was not with the intention of
recommending anyone to become a Francis of Assisi. I only wished to
point out by means of a striking example how moral power enters man,
whence it can spring and how it must be understood as something
quite special, something that was originally present in man. But
from the whole spirit of what I have said up to now you may gather
one thing with regard to other forces in human evolution, namely,
that humanity has first gone through a descent and has now
undertaken an ascent again.

If we go back in human evolution we pass through the post-Atlantean
epoch to the Atlantean catastrophe, then into the Atlantean epoch
and then further back to the Lemurian epoch. When we then arrive at
the starting-point of earthly humanity we come to a time when man,
not only as regards his spiritual qualities, was much closer to the
Deity when he first developed not only out of the spiritual life,
but also out of morality. So that at the beginning of earthly
evolution we do not find immorality but morality. Morality is a
divine gift which was given to man in the beginning, it was part of
the original content in human nature, just as spiritual power was in
human nature before man\'s deepest descent. Fundamentally, a great
part of what is immoral came into humanity in the manner we have
described, namely, by the betrayal of the higher Mysteries in the
ancient Atlantean epoch.

Thus morality is something about which we cannot say that it has
only developed gradually in humanity, it is something which lies at
the bottom of the human soul, something which has only been
submerged by the later civilisations. When we look at the matter in
the right light we cannot even say that immorality came into the
world through folly; it came into the world through the secrets of
wisdom being disclosed to persons who were not sufficiently mature
to receive them. It was through this that people were tempted, they
succumbed and then degenerated. Therefore in order that they might
rise it was above all necessary that something should occur which
would sweep away from the human soul all that is contrary to moral
impulses. Let us put this in a somewhat different form.

Let us suppose we have before us a criminal, a man whom we call
especially immoral; on no account must we think that this immoral
man is devoid of moral impulses. They are in him and we shall find
them if we delve down to the bottom of his soul. There is no human
soul --- with the exception of black magicians, with whom we are not
now concerned --- in which there is not the foundation of what is
morally good. If a person is wicked, it is because that which has
originated in the course of time as spiritual error overlies moral
goodness. Human nature is not bad; originally it was really good.
The concrete observation of human nature shows us that in its
deepest being it is good and that it was through spiritual errors
that man deviated from the moral path. Therefore moral errors must
in course of time once more be made good in humanity. Not only must
the mistakes be made good but their results as well, for where evil
has such mighty after-effects that demons of disease have been
produced, super-moral forces such as were in Francis of Assisi must
be also active.

The foundation for the improvement of a human being always consists
of removing his spiritual error. And what is necessary to this end?
Gather together what I have told you into a fundamental feeling; let
the facts speak to you, let them speak to your feelings and
perceptions, and try to gather them together into one fundamental
feeling, and then you will say: What is the attitude which a man
needs to hold regarding his fellow-man? It is that he needs the
belief in the original goodness of humanity as a whole, and of each
single human being in particular. That is the first thing we must
say if we wish to speak at all in words concerning morality; that
something immeasurably good lies at the bottom of human nature. That
is what Francis of Assisi realised; and when he was approached by
some of those stricken with the horrible disease we have described,
as a good Christian of that day he said somewhat as follows:\-- "A
disease such as this is in a certain way the consequence of sin; but
as sin is in the first instance spiritual error and disease the
result, it must therefore be removed by a mighty opposing power."
Hence Francis of Assisi saw by the sinner how, in a certain way, the
punishment of sin manifests itself externally; but he also saw the
good in human nature, he saw what lies at the bottom of each human
being as divine spiritual forces. That which distinguished Francis
of Assisi most was his sublime faith in the goodness lying in each
human being, even in one who was being punished.

This made it possible for the contrary power to appear in his soul,
and this is the power of love which gives and helps morally, and
indeed even heals. And no one, if he really develops the belief in
the original goodness of human nature into an active impulse can
arrive at anything else than to love human nature as such.

It is primarily these two fundamental impulses which are able to
found a truly moral life. First, the belief in the divine at the
bottom of every human soul, and secondly, the boundless love of man
which springs from this belief. For if was only this measureless
love which could bring Francis of Assisi to the sick, the crippled
and those stricken with leprosy. A third thing which may be added
and is necessarily built upon these two foundations, is that a
person who has a firm belief in the goodness of the human soul, and
who loves human nature, cannot do otherwise than admit that what we
see proceeding from the co-operation of the originally good
foundation of the human soul with practical love, justifies a
perspective for the future which may be expressed in the fact that
every single soul, even though it may have descended far from the
height of spiritual life, can be led back again to this spiritual
life. This third impulse implies the hope for each human soul that
it can find the way back again to the Divine-Spiritual.

We may say that Francis of Assisi heard these three things expressed
very often; they were continually in his mind during his initiation
in the Mysteries of Colchis, on the Black Sea. And we may also say
that in the life he had to lead as Francis of Assisi he preached
very little about faith or love, but was himself their embodiment.
Faith did not work, hope did not work; one must indeed have them,
but only love is effective. It stands in the centre, and it is that
which, in that single incarnation of Francis of Assisi, really
carried the actual development of humanity forward in the moral
sense towards the divine.

How did this love --- which we know was the result of his initiation
in the Colchis Mysteries --- develop in St. Francis? We have seen
that in him appeared the knightly virtues of the ancient European
spirit. He was a valiant boy. Valour, bravery, was transformed in
his individuality, which was permeated by the Christ-impulse, into
active practical love. We see the old valour, the old bravery
resurrected once more in the love manifested in Francis of Assisi.
The ancient valour transposed into the spiritual; bravery transposed
into the spiritual is love.

It is interesting to see how very much of what has just been said
corresponds also to the external historical course of human
evolution. Let us go back a few centuries into the pre-Christian
era. Among the people who have given the principal name to the
fourth post-Atlantean age, the Greeks, we find the philosopher
Plato. Among other things, Plato wrote about morals, about the
virtues of man. By the way in which he wrote, we can recognise that
he was reticent concerning the highest things, the actual secrets,
but what he felt able to say he put into the mouth of Socrates. Now,
in a period of European culture in which the Christ-impulse had not
yet acted, Plato described the highest virtues he recognised, namely
the virtues which the Greeks looked upon as those which a moral man
ought to have above all things. He described first of all three
virtues, and a fourth with which we shall later become acquainted.
The first was "Wisdom." Wisdom as such, Plato looked upon as virtue.
This is justified, for in the most varied directions we have found
that wisdom lies at the foundation of moral life. In India the
wisdom of the Brahmins lay at the foundation of human life. In
Europe this was indeed withdrawn into the background, but it existed
in the Norse Mysteries where the European Brahmins had to make good
again that which had been spoiled through the betrayal in the old
Atlantean epoch. Wisdom stands behind all morality, as we shall see
in our next lecture. Plato also described, in the manner
corresponding to the Mysteries, as the second virtue --- "Valour"
--- that which we meet with in the population of Europe. As the
third virtue he described Temperance or "Moderation" that is, the
opposite of the passionate cultivation of the lower human impulses.
These are the three chief Platonic virtues: Wisdom, Valour or
Bravery; and Moderation or Temperance, the curbing of the sensual
impulses active in man. Finally, the harmonious balancing of these
three virtues Plato describes as a fourth virtue, which he calls
"Justice."

Here is described, by one of the most eminent European minds of
pre-Christian times, what were looked upon at that time as the most
important qualities in human nature. Valour, bravery, is in the
European population permeated by the Christ-impulse and by what we
call "I". Bravery, which in Plato appears as virtue, is here
spiritualised and thereby becomes "love." The most important thing
is that we should see how moral impulses come into the human race,
how that which formerly existed in the form we have described
becomes something entirely different. Now without disparagement to
Christian morality we cannot describe as the only virtues, wisdom,
temperance, valour and justice, for we might receive the reply: "If
you had all these and yet you had not love, you would never enter
into the Kingdom of Heaven."

Let us bear in mind the time when, as we have seen, there was poured
out into humanity an impulse, a current of such a nature that wisdom
and bravery were spiritualised and re-appeared as love. But we shall
go still further into the question as to how wisdom, moderation or
temperance and justice have been developed, and thereby will appear
what is the particular moral mission of the Anthroposophical
Movement in the present day.
