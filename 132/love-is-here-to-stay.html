	<p class="intro">The more I read the papers<br>
	The less I comprehend:<br>
	The world and all its capers<br>
	And how it soon will end.<br>
	Nothing seems to be lasting,<br>
	But that isn't our affair.<br>
	We've got something permanent.<br>
	I mean in the way we care:<br>
	It's very clear our love is here to stay,<br>
	Not for a year, but ever and a day,<br>
	The radio and the telephone<br>
	And the movies that we know<br>
	May just be passing fancies and in time may go.<br>
	But, oh my dear, our love is here to stay,<br>
	Together we're going a long, long way.<br>
	In time the Rockies may crumble,<br>
	Gibraltar may tumble<br>
	They're only made of clay,<br>
	But our love is here to stay.<br>
	It's very clear our love is here to stay,<br>

<p style="font-style:normal;font-size:20px">"Love Is Here to Stay" was the last musical composition George Gershwin completed before his death on July 11, 1937. Ira Gershwin wrote the lyrics after George's death as a tribute to his brother. Although George had not written a verse for the song, he did have an idea for it that both Ira and pianist Oscar Levant had heard before his death. When a verse was needed, Ira and Levant recalled what George had in mind. Composer Vernonm Duke reconstructed the music for the verse at the beginning of the song. Originally titled "It's Here to Stay" and then "Our Love Is Here to Stay," the song was finally published as "Love Is Here to Stay." Ira Gershwin said that for years he wanted to change the song's name back to "Our Love Is Here to Stay," but he felt it wouldn't be right since the song had already become a standard.</p>
