	<p class="intro">It was a dark day in Dallas, November '63<br>
	A day that will live on in infamy<br>
	President Kennedy was a-ridin' high<br>
	Good day to be livin' and a good day to die<br>
	Being led to the slaughter like a sacrificial lamb<br>
	He said, "Wait a minute, boys, you know who I am?"<br>
	Of course we do, we know who you are! <br>
	Then they blew off his head while he was still in the car<br>
	Shot down like a dog in broad daylight<br>
	Was a matter of timing and the timing was right<br>
	You got unpaid debts, we've come to collect</p>

	<p>We're gonna kill you with hatred, without any respect<br>
	We'll mock you and shock you and we'll put it in your face<br>
	We've already got someone here to take your place<br>
	The day they blew out the brains of the king<br>
	Thousands were watching, no one saw a thing<br>
	It happened so quickly, so quick, by surprise<br>
	Right there in front of everyone's eyes<br>
	Greatest magic trick ever under the sun<br>
	Perfectly executed, skillfully done<br>
	Wolfman, oh wolfman, oh wolfman howl<br>
	Rub-a-dub-dub, it's a murder most foul<br>
	Hush, little children. You'll understand<br>
	The Beatles are comin'; they're gonna hold your hand<br>
	Slide down the banister, go get your coat<br>
	Ferry 'cross the Mersey and go for the throat<br>
	There's three bums comin' all dressed in rags<br>
	Pick up the pieces and lower the flags</p>

	<p>I'm goin' to Woodstock, it's the Aquarian Age<br>
	Then I'll go to Altamont and sit near the stage<br>
	Put your head out the window, let the good times roll<br>
	There's a party going on behind the Grassy Knoll<br>
	Stack up the bricks, pour the cement<br>
	Don't say Dallas don't love you, Mr. President<br>
	Put your foot in the tank and then step on the gas<br>
	Try to make it to the triple underpass<br>
	Blackface singer, whiteface clown<br>
	Better not show your faces after the sun goes down<br>
	Up in the red light district, they've got cop on the beat<br>
	Living in a nightmare on Elm Street</p>

	<p>When you're down on Deep Ellum, put your money in your shoe<br>
	Don't ask what your country can do for you<br>
	Cash on the ballot, money to burn<br>
	Dealey Plaza, make a left-hand turn<br>
	I'm going down to the crossroads, gonna flag a ride<br>
	The place where faith, hope, and charity lie<br>
	Shoot him while he runs, boy, shoot him while you can<br>
	See if you can shoot the invisible man<br>
	Goodbye, Charlie! Goodbye, Uncle Sam!<br>
	Frankly, Miss Scarlett, I don't give a damn</p>

	<p>What is the truth, and where did it go?<br>
	Ask Oswald and Ruby, they oughta know<br>
	Shut your mouth, said a wise old owl<br>
	Business is business, and it's a murder most foul</p>

	<p>Tommy, can you hear me? I'm the Acid Queen<br>
	I'm riding in a long, black Lincoln limousine<br>
	Ridin' in the backseat next to my wife<br>
	Headed straight on in to the afterlife<br>
	I'm leaning to the left, I got my head in her lap<br>
	Hold on, I've been led into some kind of a trap<br>
	Where we ask no quarter, and no quarter do we give<br>
	We're right down the street, from the street where you live<br>
	They mutilated his body and they took out his brain<br>
	What more could they do? They piled on the pain<br>
	But his soul was not there where it was supposed to be at<br>
	For the last fifty years they've been searchin' for that</p>

	<p>Freedom, oh freedom, freedom over me<br>
	I hate to tell you, mister, but only dead men are free<br>
	Send me some lovin', then tell me no lie<br>
	Throw the gun in the gutter and walk on by<br>
	Wake up, little Susie, let's go for a drive<br>
	Cross the Trinity River, let's keep hope alive<br>
	Turn the radio on, don't touch the dials<br>
	Parkland hospital, only six more miles<br>
	You got me dizzy, Miss Lizzy, you filled me with lead<br>
	That magic bullet of yours has gone to my head<br>
	I'm just a patsy like Patsy Cline<br>
	Never shot anyone from in front or behind<br>
	I've blood in my eye, got blood in my ear<br>
	I'm never gonna make it to the new frontier<br>
	Zapruder's film I seen night before<br>
	Seen it thirty-three times, maybe more<br>
	It's vile and deceitful, it's cruel and it's mean<br>
	Ugliest thing that you ever have seen<br>
	They killed him once and they killed him twice<br>
	Killed him like a human sacrifice</p>

	<p>The day that they killed him, someone said to me, "Son<br>
	The age of the Antichrist has just only begun"</p>

	<p>Air Force One comin' in through the gate<br>
	Johnson sworn in at 2:38<br>
	Let me know when you decide to throw in the towel<br>
	It is what it is, and it's murder most foul</p>

	<p>What's new, pussycat? What'd I say?<br>
	I said the soul of a nation been torn away<br>
	And it's beginning to go into a slow decay<br>
	And that it's thirty-six hours past Judgment Day<br>
