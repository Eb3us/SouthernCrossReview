	<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">My dear Sisters and Brothers,</P>
	<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="widows: 8">Since
	the Christmas Conference an esoteric breath flows through the whole
	Anthroposophical Society. And those members of the Anthroposophical
	Society who have taken part in the general members' lectures will
	have noted how this esoteric breath flows through all the work
	within the anthroposophical movement now, and should do so in the
	future.</P>
	<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="widows: 8">This
	was a necessity which, above all, flows from the spiritual world,
	from where the revelations come which should live in the
	anthroposophical movement.</P>
	<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="widows: 8">Therefore
	the necessity arose to create a certain nucleus for anthroposophical
	esoteric life, to create real esoteric life, and therewith the
	necessity arose to build a bridge to the spiritual world itself.</P>
	<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="widows: 8">In a
	certain sense the spiritual world had to manifest the will for the
	creation of such a School. For an esoteric school cannot be created
	by human arbitrariness, nor from that human arbitrariness called
	&ldquo;human ideals&rdquo;; rather must this esoteric school be the
	body for something which flows out of spiritual life, so that
	everything that occurs in such a school presents the outer
	expression of an activity which in reality occurs in the spiritual
	world itself. Therefore this esoteric school could not have been
	created without first asking the will of Michael, which since the
	last third of the nineteenth century has been guiding human affairs
	&ndash; something which I have often mentioned here in members'
	lectures.</P>
	<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="widows: 8">In
	the course of time this will of Michael again and again cyclically
	intervenes in human affairs from the spiritual world. And when we
	look back in the evolution of time, we find that this same
	Michael-Will &ndash; which we can also call the Michael Reign &ndash;
	was active in the spiritual affairs of humanity, in the great
	questions of civilization before the Mystery of Golgotha, in the
	time of Alexander in Greece through the Chthonian and Celestial
	mysteries, and which was to spread to Asia and Africa. Where the
	Michael-Will reigns there is always cosmopolitanism. What
	differentiates people on earth is overcome during the Michael age.</P>
	<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="widows: 8">The
	most important influence, related to Aristotle and to Alexander,
	which was under the impulse of Michael, was followed by that of
	Oripheal, and after Oripheal came the Anael impulse, the Zachariel
	impulse, then the Raphael impulse, then the Samael impulse, then the
	Gabriel impulse, which extended into the 19<SUP>th</SUP> century.
	And since the seventies of the nineteenth century we are again under
	the sign of Michael's reign. It is in its beginnings. But Michael's
	impulses must flow into all legitimate esoteric activities in a
	conscious manner &ndash; what can be clear to you, my sisters and
	brothers, through the general lectures for members.</P>
	<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="widows: 8">  
	And everything connected with the Christmas Conference leads to what
	is constituted as the basis of the anthroposophical movement's
	formation of this Esoteric School inspired and guided by Michael. It
	therefore rightfully exists in our times as a spiritual institution.
	All those who want to be rightful members of this School must accept
	this in their lives with the deepest sincerity. They must feel that
	they don't merely belong to an earthly community, but to a
	supersensible community, whose guide and leader is Michael himself.
	Therefore, everything communicated here is not to be understood as
	my words, insofar as they are the content of the lessons, but rather
	as what Michael communicates in an esoteric manner to those who feel
	they belong with him in this age. Therefore, what these lessons
	contain will be Michael's message for our age.</P>
	<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="widows: 8">And
	it is because of this that the anthroposophical movement will
	receive its true spiritual strength. For this it is necessary that
	what membership in this School means be taken with the utmost
	earnestness. It is really necessary, my dear sisters and brothers,
	truly and deeply necessary, that it be indicated in the utmost
	earnest manner the sacred earnestness with which the School must be
	taken.</P>
	<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="widows: 8">And
	here within the School it must be repeatedly said: in
	anthroposophical circles there is much too little earnestness for
	what really flows through the anthroposophical movement, and at
	least the esoteric members of the Esoteric School must be in the
	forefront of what humanity can gradually develop as the necessary
	earnestness. Therefore it is necessary that the leadership of the
	School retain for itself the right to allow only those to enter as
	rightful, worthy members of the School who, in every aspect of their
	lives, want to be worthy representatives of anthroposophy; and the
	decision about whether this is the case or not must lie with the
	School's leadership.</P>
	<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="widows: 8">Do
	not consider this, my sisters and brothers, as a limitation of
	freedom. The School's leadership must also have its freedom and be
	able to recognize who belongs to the School and who does not, just
	as each one is free to decide whether to belong to the School or
	not. So a free, ideal-spiritual contract, so to speak, between each
	member of the School and the leadership must be agreed upon. In no
	other way could esoteric development be called healthy, especially
	not one which is worthy of the fact that this Esoteric School exists
	under the direct force of the Michael impulse itself.</P>
	<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="widows: 8">Conscientious
	care of the mantric verses so that they do not fall into
	unauthorized hands is the first requisite; but also to really be a
	worthy representative of the anthroposophical cause.</P>
	<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="widows: 8">I
	only need to mention a few things to show how little the
	anthroposophical movement is still grasped with complete
	earnestness. It has happened that members of the School have
	reserved their seats by placing on them the blue membership
	certificates, which gives them the right to participate in the
	School.<FONT SIZE=3>[1]</FONT> It has happened in the
	Anthroposophical Society that whole piles of the News Sheets, only
	intended for members, have been found on the trolley cars that run
	from Dornach to Basel. And I could add many other examples to this
	list. And amazing things happen as a result of this lack of
	earnestness. Even with things that in everyday life are taken
	seriously, at the moment when those within the anthroposophical
	movement are expected to do so, they do not take them seriously.</P>
	<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="widows: 8">These
	are things which must be considered in connection with the firm
	structure that this School must have. Therefore these things must be
	said, because if they are not observed, one cannot worthily receive
	what is given here in the School as revelations from the spiritual
	world. At the end of each lesson, your attention is expressly drawn
	to the fact that the being of Michael is present while the
	revelations from the spiritual world are given, and are confirmed by
	Michael's sign and seal.</P>
	<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="widows: 8">All
	these things must live in the members' hearts. And worthiness,
	profound worthiness must reign in all that is bound even in thought
	to the School. For only in this way what today is to be carried
	through the world as an esoteric stream can live. And that includes
	the duties incumbent on each individual.</P>
	<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="widows: 8">The
	mantric verses written here on the blackboard can only be possessed,
	in the strictest sense of the word, by those who have the right to
	be present. And if a member of the School is unable to attend a
	lesson during which mantric verses are given, another member, who
	has the verses, may give them to him; but it must be for each
	individual case, that is, for each person to whom the verses are to
	be given, that permission must be requested, either from Dr. Wegman
	or from me. Once permission is granted in respect to a person, it
	remains valid.  But permission must again be requested for each
	other individual. This is not an administrative rule, it is an
	occult rule that must be strictly adhered to. For every act of the
	School must be connected to the School's leadership: and that begins
	with having to request permission from the School's leadership for
	acts having to do with the School. Not the one who is to receive the
	mantras may ask, but only the one who is to give them, using the
	modality that I have just described. If someone takes notes on what
	is said here, except for the mantras, he is obliged to keep them for
	only one week, and then to burn them.</P>
	<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="widows: 8">All
	these things are not arbitrary rules, but they relate to the occult
	fact that esoteric matters are only effective if they are embraced
	by the School members' attitude. The mantras lose their
	effectiveness if they fall into the wrong hands. And it is a rule so
	firmly inscribed in the cosmic order, that the following once
	happened and a whole group of mantras, which had been in effect
	within the anthroposophical movement, have been rendered
	ineffective.</P>
	<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="widows: 8">I
	was able to give mantric verses to a number of people; I also gave
	them to a certain person, who had a friend. The friend was somewhat
	clairvoyant. And it happened that while the two friends were
	sleeping in the same room, the clairvoyant friend, when the other
	one merely repeated the mantra in thought, surreptitiously copied it
	and then did mischief with it by giving it to others as coming from
	himself. It was necessary to look into the matter, which revealed
	why the mantra became ineffective for all those who possessed it.</P>
	<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="widows: 8">Therefore,
	my dear sisters and brothers, you must not take these things
	lightly, for esoteric rules are strict; and when someone has made
	such an error, he should not excuse himself by claiming that he was
	unable to avoid it. Of course if someone runs through a mantra in
	his mind, and someone else copies it clairvoyantly, he certainly can
	do nothing about it. Nevertheless, the rules are applied with an
	iron necessity. <FONT SIZE=3>[2]</FONT></P>
	<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="widows: 8">I
	mention this so that you can see how little arbitrariness is
	involved, and how these things are being read from the spiritual
	world and that the practices of the spiritual world apply. Nothing
	is arbitrary in what occurs in a rightly existing esoteric school.
	And the earnestness from this esoteric school should stream out to
	the whole anthroposophical movement. For only then will this School
	be what it should be for the anthroposophical movement. But when
	something is done which only springs from personal motives and then
	it is pretended that it is because of devotion to the
	anthroposophical movement  &ndash; well, I don't mean to say that it
	should not happen, because obviously people today must be personal &ndash;
	but then it is also necessary that truth lives in what is personal,
	that for instance if someone comes here to Dornach for personal
	pleasure he should admit it and not pretend otherwise. There's
	nothing wrong with coming to Dornach for personal pleasure, in fact
	it is good. But one should admit it and not sidestep it by declaring
	pure dedication to spiritual life.</P>
	<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="widows: 8">I
	mention this; I could just as well mention another example, which is
	more real, for it is really the case that when most of our friends
	come to Dornach, a will to sacrifice is involved, and that only in
	the least of cases is untruthfulness involved. But I've chosen this
	example because it is the least applicable and thus the least
	harmful. If I had mentioned other examples, what I would like to
	have as a calm prevailing mood in the hearts and souls of all who
	are sitting here now could not exist in the necessary degree.</P>
	<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="widows: 8"><BR>
	</P>
	<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="widows: 8">After
	that introduction, I would like to start with the verse that is the
	beginning and end of Michael's proclamation to all unbiased human
	beings, and which contains what all entities in the world are
	saying, if one listens to them with the soul. For from all that
	lives in the mineral, vegetable and animal kingdoms, what sparkles
	down from the stars, what acts into our souls from the domains of
	the hierarchies, from all that crawls under and on the earth as
	worm-life, from what speaks in rocks and springs and fields and
	thunder and clouds and lightning; all these spoke to unbiased human
	beings in the past, speak at the present and will speak in the
	future:

	<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="widows: 8">The
	previous lesson ended, my dear sisters and brothers, with the
	Guardian of the Threshold giving the last admonitions before one
	passes over the yawning abyss of being; the Guardian of the
	Threshold spoke the weighty, moving words:</P>
	<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">
	</P>
	<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Come in,<br>
	The gate has opened;<br>
	You will become<br>
	A true human being.
	<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">
	</P>
	<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="widows: 8">Our
	souls and hearts have been exposed to the important, weighty,
	meaningful words spoken by the Guardian of the Threshold on behalf
	of Michael. And everything he said was to prepare us for the
	attitude we must have when we come over after the gate has been
	opened &ndash; over the yawning abyss of being, where one does not
	come walking with earthly feet, where one flies with the spiritual
	wings that grow when the soul is imbued with a spiritual attitude,
	with spiritual love, with spiritual feeling.</P>
	<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="widows: 8">And
	now, now, my dear sisters and brothers, will be described what the
	human being experiences when he stands on the other side of the
	yawning abyss of being. The Guardian of the Threshold indicates to
	him: turn around and look back! Until now you have been looking at
	what appeared to you as black, night-cloaked gloom, about which you
	had to say that it will become inner light and will illumine your
	own Self. With the last admonitions &ndash; the Guardian of the
	Threshold says &ndash; I let it become lighter, at first most
	gently. You feel now the first light around you. But turn around,
	look back!</P>
	<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="widows: 8">And
	now, when he who has crossed over the yawning abyss of being and
	turns around and looks back, he sees himself as an earthly human
	being, what he is during his physical incarnation, over there in the
	part of his being that he has left behind and which now lies in the
	earthly sphere. He observes his own human self there. He has
	embodied himself in spiritual being with his spirit-soul. The
	earthly environment is over there now. He stands there in the
	region, in which we first were with all our humanity, where we saw
	what crawls beneath and flies above, where we saw the sparkling
	stars, the warmth-giving sun, where we saw what lives in the wind
	and weather, and where, knowing that despite all its majesty, how
	the sun blazes and illumines, despite all the beauty and greatness
	accessible to the senses, we said to ourselves: our own humanity is
	not here; we must seek it on the other side of the yawning abyss of
	being, in what seems at first, to the senses, to be black,
	night-cloaked gloom.</P>
	<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="widows: 8">The
	Guardian of the Threshold has shown, by the three beasts, what we
	actually are. Now will be described how in the gloom that is
	beginning to be light, we should begin to look back on what we as
	humans are in the sensory world, together with what was our only
	world in sensory earthly existence.</P>
	<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="widows: 8">And
	now the Guardian of the Threshold points directly back there to the
	earthly man, which we ourselves also are during earthly existence,
	and to which we must continually return, into which we must always
	penetrate when we leave the spiritual world and return to our
	earthly duty. For we may not become dreamers and go into raptures,
	we must return completely to earth life. Therefore the Guardian of
	the Threshold directs us to look at the person who stands over
	there, who we ourselves are, in a way that at first draws our
	attention to what this person is. [An outline of a human being is
	drawn on the blackboard.]</P>

	<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">He knows that he perceives the outer
	world through the senses, which are mostly situated in the head, and
	that he perceives his thinking through the impulse of the head.  
	</P>
	<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="widows: 8">But
	the Guardian of the Threshold now says: Look into this head. It is
	like looking into a dark cell, for you do not see the creative light
	within it. The truth is that what you had as thinking over there in
	the sensory world is mere seeming, mere images, not much more than
	mirror-images.</P>
	<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="widows: 8">The
	Guardian of the Threshold admonishes us to be very aware of this,
	but also to be aware that what is only appearance in earthly
	thinking is the corpse &ndash; as we have heard in previous lessons
	&ndash; of a living thinking in which we were immersed in the
	soul-spiritual world before we descended to this earthly life. There
	thinking lived!  Now thinking rests as dead thinking, as seeming
	thinking in the coffin of our bodies. And all the thinking we use in
	the sensory world is dead thinking. It was alive before we
	descended.</P>
	<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="widows: 8">And
	what has this thinking accomplished? It has created everything that
	is within the head, within this dark cell &ndash; as it appears to
	the senses &ndash; that is light-creating essence. The brain, which
	rests within as thinking's support, has been created by living
	thinking. [The interior of the head, yellow, is drawn on the
	blackboard.] It is living thinking that creates the support for our
	earthly semblance of thinking.</P>
	<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="widows: 8">Observe
	the brain's convolutions, observe what you carry within the dark
	cell that enables you to think, my sisters and brothers, observe the
	semblance of thinking in the dark cell, then you will find in what
	is felt above as thinking [drawing: red arrows] from out of which
	streams the force of will into thinking, so that each thought is
	streamed through with will. How the will streams into thinking can
	be sensed.</P>
	<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="widows: 8">And
	now we look back from the other side of the threshold at how that
	other person, who we ourselves are, has waves of will streaming out
	of his body into the head, which create the will, and finally, when
	we follow them back to the turning points of time which lead to our
	previous incarnations, how they create the waves of thought from
	worlds past into our present incarnation and form our heads, all of 
	which makes the semblance of thinking in this incarnation possible.</P>
	<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="widows: 8">Therefore
	we must be strong, the Guardian of the Threshold tells us, and
	imagine dead thinking being cast out into the cosmic nothingness,
	for it is only seeming. And the willing that then arises we should
	consider as what comes over from previous incarnations and
	interweaves and works, making us thinkers. Within [drawing: yellow]
	are the creating cosmic thoughts. These creating cosmic thoughts
	enable us to have human thoughts.</P>
	<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="widows: 8">Therefore,
	the first words the Guardian of the Threshold speaks after he has
	let us cross the threshold, and after he has announced that the gate
	has opened, that we can become true human beings, the first words he
	speaks are:</P>
	<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="widows: 8"><BR><BR>
	</P>
	<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">See behind thinking's sensory light,</P>

	depths;</P>

	then the Guardian of the Threshold adds &ndash; and one must strain
	to hear him: Now imagine that you are observing that figure on the
	other side who you yourself are; you turn around again and look into
	the darkness and try with all your inner imaginative force of
	remembrance &ndash; as one does when retaining a physical
	after-image in the eye. Try with all your strength to draw before
	you something like a gray outline of what you saw over there, but
	avoid drawing anything except the outline of the figure. [It is
	drawn.]</P>
	<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="widows: 8">Then,
	if one succeeds in seeing this gray outline of a figure, behind it
	appears an image of the moon [a sickle moon, yellow, is drawn], the
	gray figure before it.</P>
	<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="widows: 8">If
	one is able to keep inner calm, one sees the moon in the distance.
	The gray figure outline is also there, but it is active in us. And
	if we practice this over and over, we feel we have arrived at the
	spiritual figure of the head that we had over there, not the
	physical human figure, but at the spiritual figure of the head that
	we had over there, if we can feel what karma brings to us from
	previous earthly incarnations. [yellow arrow at the right of the
	sickle moon.]</P>
	<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="widows: 8">Therefore
	you should meditate on this picture that I have drawn here, the
	sickle moon with this arrow; let the mantra unfold, with this
	picture as the marker for the gradual familiarization with what
	forcefully comes over from previous earthly existences.</P>
	<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="widows: 8">And
	secondly, the Guardian of the Threshold points with a stronger
	gesture to what feeling is to the person over there, who we
	ourselves are, and he admonishes that we are to see this feeling as
	a dim dream. In fact, we see feeling &ndash; which makes the person
	over there more real than thinking, for thinking is illusion,
	whereas feeling is half reality &ndash; we see the person's feeling
	enfold in numerous dream-pictures during the day. We learn by
	observing it that feeling, for the spirit and in the spirit, is
	dreaming.</P>
	<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="widows: 8">But
	what kind of dreaming is feeling? In this feeling, not only the
	individual dreams, but within it the whole surrounding world dreams.
	Our thinking is our own. That's why it's illusion. The world lives
	in our feeling. The world's existence is within it.  
	</P>
	<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="widows: 8">Now
	we must achieve, to the extent possible, tranquility of heart, the
	Guardian warns, so that we can extinguish what lives and interweaves
	as feeling in the dream-pictures, just as dreams are extinguished in
	deep sleep. Then we can reach the truth of feeling, and we can see
	human feeling interwoven with the cosmic life that is present in
	spirit in all our surroundings. And then the real spiritual human
	being appears to us, who in his body lives at first in his
	half-existence. The human being appears to us from out of sleeping
	feeling. We feel ourselves to be on the other side of the threshold,
	on the other side of the yawning abyss of being, for feeling has
	fallen asleep and the cosmic creative powers, which live in feeling,
	have appeared around us.</P>

	Guardian of the Threshold indicates to us that we should look back
	once again at the gray figure that stands over there, which we are
	ourselves in earthly life, but this time after having turned away,
	in our minds we turn it around in a circle. We will find, when we
	rotate the figure, that the sun appears behind it and rotates with
	it. [It is drawn &ndash; left, red]. And we will realize that at the
	moment we are brought into physical existence from the spiritual
	world, our etheric body has been compressed from the cosmic ether.
	Therefore, just as the first verse belongs to this [the drawing of
	the gray figure and the first verse are numbered &ldquo;I&rdquo;],
	this second verse belongs to this. [The drawing of the red rotating
	form and the second verse are numbered &ldquo;II&rdquo;.]</P>
	<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="widows: 8">Then
	the Guardian of the Threshold refers us to our will, which is active
	in our limbs. And he strongly draws our attention to the fact that
	whatever relates to the will is in a sleeping state, even when we
	are awake. He explains how as the thought works downward &ndash; I
	explained it last time, so may say it now &ndash;, how as the
	thought carries warmth downward into our limbs' movement so that it
	becomes will: this becomes clear in spiritual cognition and
	spiritual seeing. Normal consciousness hides this when we are
	sleeping, as it hides life in general during sleep. Now we should
	observe the will in the limbs as though sunken in deep sleep. The
	will is asleep. The limbs are asleep. We should see this as a firm
	mental image. Then, when it is firm, we realize how thinking, the
	source of willing in earthly man, sinks down into the limbs. Then it
	becomes light in him. The will becomes bright. It wakes up. When we
	first see it in its sleeping state, we find that it wakes up when
	thinking sinks downward and light from below streams upward, which
	is the force of gravity. Feel the force of gravity in your legs and
	arms when you let them relax: that is what streams upward, and which
	meets with the downward streaming thinking. We observe human will
	transformed into its reality and thinking appearing as what ignites
	the will in man in an enchanting, magical way. That is the truly
	magical effect of thinking on the will. It is magic. Now we become
	aware of it. The Guardian of the Threshold says:</P>
