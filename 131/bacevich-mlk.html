	<h3>Racism, Yes, But What About Militarism and Materialism?</h3>
	<h2>By Andrew Bacevich</h2>
</header>
<main>



	<p class="intro">In the wake of the police killing of George Floyd, Americans are finally -- or is it once again? -- confronting the racism that afflicts this country and extends into just about every corner of our national life. Something fundamental just might be happening.</p>
	<p>Yet to state the obvious, we’ve <a href="https://www.blackpast.org/special-features/racial-violence-united-states-1660/">been here</a> before. Mass protests in response to racial inequality and discrimination, including police brutality, have been anything but unknown in the United States. Much the same can be said of riots targeting black Americans, fomented and exploited by white racists, often actively or passively abetted by local law enforcement officials. If Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin, formerly known as H. Rap Brown, was correct in <a href="https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/h_rap_brown_166743">calling</a> violence “as American as cherry pie,” then race-related urban unrest is the apple-filled equivalent. </p>
	<p>The optimists among us <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/06/why-george-floyd-protests-are-different.html">believe</a> that “this time is different.” I hope events will prove them right. Yet recalling expectations that Barack Obama’s election in 2008 signaled the dawn of a “<a href="https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=18489466">post-racial America</a>,” I see no reason to expect it to be so. A yawning gap, I fear, separates hope from reality.</p>
	<p>Let me suggest, however, that the nation’s current preoccupation with race, as honorable and necessary as it may be, falls well short of adequately responding to the situation confronting Americans as they enter the third decade of the twenty-first century. Racism is a massive problem, but hardly our only one. Indeed, as Martin Luther King sought to remind us many years ago, there are at least two others of comparable magnitude.</p>
	<h4>MLK Defines the Problem</h4>
	<p>In April 1967, at New York City’s Riverside Church, Dr. King delivered a <a href="https://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/mlkatimetobreaksilence.htm">sermon</a> that offered a profound diagnosis of the illnesses afflicting the nation. His analysis remains as timely today as it was then, perhaps more so.</p>
	<p>Americans remember King primarily as a great civil rights leader and indeed he was that. In his Riverside Church address, however, he turned to matters that went far beyond race. In an immediate sense, his focus was the ongoing Vietnam War, which he denounced as “madness” that “must cease.” Yet King also used the occasion to summon the nation to “undergo a radical revolution of values” that would transform the United States “from a thing-oriented society to a person-oriented society.” Only through such a revolution, he declared, would we be able to overcome “the giant triplets of racism, extreme materialism, and militarism.”</p>
	<p>The challenge confronting Americans was to dismantle what King referred to as the “edifice” that produced and sustained each of those giant triplets. Today’s protesters, crusading journalists, and engaged intellectuals make no bones about their determination to eliminate the first of those giant triplets. Yet they generally treat the other two as, at best, mere afterthoughts, while the edifice itself, resting on a perverse understanding of freedom, goes almost entirely ignored.</p>
	<p>I’m not suggesting that members of the grand coalition of Americans today fervently campaigning against racism favor extreme materialism. Many of them merely accept its reality and move on. Nor am I suggesting that they consciously endorse militarism, although in confusing “support” for the troops with genuine patriotism some of them do so implicitly. What I am suggesting is that those calling for fundamental change will go badly astray if they ignore Dr. King’s insistence that each of the giant triplets is intimately tied to the other two.</p>
	<h4>Defund the Pentagon?</h4>
	<p>The protests triggered by the recent murders of George Floyd and other black Americans have produced widespread demands to “defund the police.” Those demands don’t come out of nowhere. While “reform” programs undertaken in innumerable American cities over the course of many years have demonstrably <a href="https://www.charleskochinstitute.org/issue-areas/criminal-justice-policing-reform/militarization-of-police/">enhanced police firepower</a>, they have done little, if anything, to repair relations between police departments and communities of color.</p>
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1250175089/ref=nosim/?tag=tomdispatch-20"><div class="polaroid"><img class="b" src="age-of-illusions.jpg" alt="Every Body has a Story book cover" style="width:100%"><div class="container"><p>Buy the Book!</p></div></div></a>
	<p>As an aging middle-class white male, I don’t fear cops. I respect the fact that theirs is a tough job, which I would not want. Yet I realize that my attitude is one more expression of white privilege, which black men, regardless of their age and economic status, can ill afford to indulge. So I fully accept the need for radical changes in policing -- that’s what “defund” appears to imply -- if American cities are ever to have law enforcement agencies that are effective, humane, and themselves law-abiding.</p>
	<p>What I can’t fathom is why a similar logic doesn’t apply to the armed forces that we employ to police huge chunks of the world beyond our borders. If Americans have reason to question the nation’s <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/pentagon-hand-me-downs-militarize-police-1033-program/">increasingly militarized</a> approach to law enforcement, then shouldn’t they have equal reason to question this country’s thoroughly militarized approach to statecraft?  </p>
	<p>Consider this: on an annual basis, police officers in the United States kill approximately <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/protests-spread-over-police-shootings-police-promised-reforms-every-year-they-still-shoot-nearly-1000-people/2020/06/08/5c204f0c-a67c-11ea-b473-04905b1af82b_story.html">1,000 Americans</a>, with blacks <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/interactive/2020/05/mapping-police-killings-black-americans-200531105741757.html">two-and-a-half times</a> more likely than whites to be victimized. Those are appalling figures, indicative of basic policy gone fundamentally awry. So the outpouring of protest over the police and demands for change are understandable and justified.</p>
	<p>Still, the question must be asked: Why have the nation’s post-9/11 wars not prompted similar expressions of outrage?  The unjustified killing of black Americans rightly finds thousands upon thousands of protesters flooding the streets of major cities. Yet the <a href="https://www.defense.gov/casualty.pdf">loss</a> of thousands of American soldiers and the physical and psychological wounds sustained by tens of thousands more in foolhardy wars elicits, at best, shrugs. Throw in the <a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/11/19/civilian-casualties-us-war-on-terror/">hundreds of thousands</a> of non-American lives taken in those military campaigns and the <a href="https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/files/cow/imce/papers/2019/US%20Budgetary%20Costs%20of%20Wars%20November%202019.pdf">trillions</a> of taxpayer dollars they have consumed and you have a catastrophe that easily exceeds in scale the myriad race-related protests and riots that have roiled American cities in the recent past.</p>
	<p>With their eyes fixed on elections that are now just months away, politicians of all stripes spare no effort to show that they “get it” on the issue of race and policing. Race may well play a large role in determining who wins the White House this November and which party controls Congress. It should. Yet while the election’s final outcome may be uncertain, this much is not: neither the American <a href="https://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/176623/tomgram%3A_andrew_bacevich%2C_why_those_%22endless_wars%22_must_never_end">propensity</a> for war, nor the <a href="https://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/176669/tomgram%3A_mandy_smithberger%2C_letting_the_pentagon_loose_with_your_tax_dollars">bloated size</a> of the Pentagon budget, nor the dubious habit of maintaining a <a href="https://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/176043/tomgram%3A_david_vine%2C_our_base_nation">sprawling network</a> of military bases across much of the planet will receive serious scrutiny during the political season now underway. Militarism will escape unscathed.</p>
	<p>At Riverside Church, King described the U.S. government as “the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today.” So it unquestionably remains, perpetrating immeasurably more violence than any other great power and with remarkably little to show in return. Why, then, except on the easily ignored fringes of American politics, are there no demands to “defund” the Pentagon?</p>
	<p>King considered the Vietnam War an abomination. At that time, more than a few Americans agreed with him and vigorously demonstrated against the conflict's continuation. That today’s demonstrators have seemingly chosen to file away our post-9/11 military misadventures under the heading of regrettable but forgettable is itself an abomination. While their sensitivity to racism is admirable, their indifference to war is nothing short of disheartening.</p>
	<p>In 1967, Dr. King warned that “a nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death.” During the intervening decades, his charge has lost none of its sting or aptness.</p>
	<h4>America’s National Signature</h4>
	<p>Given their size and duration, the protests occurring in the wake of the murder of George Floyd have been remarkably peaceful. That said, some of them did, early on, include rioters who resorted to looting. Smashing windows and ransacking stores, they walked off not with milk and bread for the hungry, but with shopping bags filled with <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8404789/Looters-stole-goods-George-Floyd-protests-offering-swag-sale-Facebook-Live.html">high-end swag</a> -- designer shoes and sneakers, purses, clothing, and jewelry lifted from <a href="https://www.thefashionlaw.com/how-will-resale-sites-respond-to-an-expected-flood-of-looted-luxury-goods/">stores</a> like Prada and Alexander McQueen. Also stolen were smart phones, <a href="https://www.wjcl.com/article/atf-dollar10000-reward-offered-after-40-plus-guns-stolen-from-georgia-shop-during-riots-looting/32798056">handguns</a>, even <a href="https://www.sacbee.com/news/california/article243251706.html">automobiles</a>. In-store surveillance systems recorded <a href="https://www.mystateline.com/news/national/florida-deputies-seek-to-id-200-walmart-looters-who-stole-100k-worth-of-items/">scenes</a> reminiscent of Black Friday doorbuster sales, though without anyone bothering to pass through a checkout counter. Some looters quickly attempted to monetize their hauls by <a href="https://www.thefashionlaw.com/how-will-resale-sites-respond-to-an-expected-flood-of-looted-luxury-goods/">offering</a> to sell purloined items online.</p>
	<p>Certain right-wing commentators wasted no time in using the looting to tar the protest movement as little more than an expression of nihilism. Tucker Carlson of Fox News was <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-leaders-agents-of-chaos-crimes-mob">particularly emphatic</a> on this point. Americans taking to the streets in response to George Floyd’s murder, he said, “reject society itself.” </p>
	<p>“Reason and process and precedent mean nothing to them. They use violence to get what they want immediately. People like this don’t bother to work. They don’t volunteer or pay taxes to help other people. They live for themselves. They do exactly what they feel like doing... On television, hour by hour, we watch these people -- criminal mobs -- destroy what the rest of us have built..."</p>
	<p>To explain such selfish and destructive misconduct, Carlson had an answer readily at hand:</p>
	<p>“The ideologues will tell you that the problem is race relations, or capitalism, or police brutality, or global warming. But only on the surface. The real cause is deeper than that and it’s far darker. What you’re watching is the ancient battle between those who have a stake in society, and would like to preserve it, and those who don’t, and seek to destroy it."</p>
	<p>This is vile, hateful stuff, and entirely wrong -- except perhaps on one point. In attributing the looting to a deeper cause, Carlson was onto something, even if his effort to pinpoint that cause was wildly off the mark.</p>
	<p>I won’t try to unravel the specific motives of those who saw an opportunity in the protests against racism to help themselves to goods that were not theirs. How much was righteous anger turned to rage and how much cynical opportunism is beyond my ability to know.</p>
	<p>This much, however, can be said for certain: the grab-all-you-can-get impulse so vividly on display was as all-American as fireworks on the Fourth of July. Those looters, after all, merely wanted more stuff. What could be more American than that? In this country, after all, stuff carries with it the possibility of personal fulfillment, of achieving some version of happiness or status.</p>
	<p>The looters that Tucker Carlson targeted with his ire were doing anything but “rejecting society itself.” They were merely helping themselves to what this society today has on offer for those with sufficient cash and credit cards in their wallets. In a sense, they were treating themselves to a tiny sip of what passes these days for the American Dream.</p>
	<p>With the exception of cloistered nuns, hippies, and other vanishing breeds, virtually all Americans have been conditioned to buy into the proposition that stuff correlates with the good life. Unconvinced? Check out the videos from last year’s Black Friday and then consider the intense, if unsurprising, interest of economists and journalists in tracking the <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/components-of-gdp-explanation-formula-and-chart-3306015">latest consumer spending trends</a>. At least until Covid-19 came along, consumer spending served as the authoritative measure of the nation’s overall health.</p>
	<p>The primary civic obligation of U.S. citizens today is not to vote or pay taxes. And it’s certainly not to defend the country, a task offloaded onto those who can be enticed to enlist (with minorities <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/09/10/the-changing-profile-of-the-u-s-military/">vastly overrepresented</a>) in the so-called All-Volunteer Military. No, the primary obligation of citizenship is to spend.</p>
	<p>Ours is not a nation of mystics, philosophers, poets, artisans, or Thomas Jefferson’s yeomen farmers. We are now a nation of citizen-consumers, held in thrall to the extreme materialism that Dr. King decried. This, not a commitment to liberty or democracy, has become our true national signature and our chief contribution to late modernity.</p>
	<h4>Tearing Down the Edifice</h4>
	<p>At Riverside Church, King reminded his listeners that the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, which he had helped to found a decade earlier, had chosen this as its motto: "To save the soul of America." The soul of a nation corrupted by racism, militarism, and extreme materialism represented King’s ultimate concern. Vietnam, he said, was “but a symptom of a far deeper malady within the American spirit.”</p>
	<p>In a <a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1967/04/07/90316200.html?pageNumber=36">tone-deaf editorial</a> criticizing his Riverside Church sermon, the New York Times chastised King for “fusing two public problems” -- racism and the Vietnam War -- “that are distinct and separate.” Yet part of King’s genius lay in his ability to recognize the interconnectedness of matters that Times editors, as oblivious to deeper maladies then as they are today, wish to keep separate. King sought to tear down the edifice that sustained all three of those giant triplets. Indeed, it is all but certain that, were he alive now, he would call similar attention to a fourth related factor: climate change denial. The refusal to treat seriously the threat posed by climate change underwrites the persistence of racism, militarism, and extreme materialism.</p>
	<p>During the course of his sermon, King quoted this sentence from the statement of a group that called itself the Clergy and Laymen Concerned About Vietnam: “A time comes when silence is betrayal.” Regarding race, it appears that the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/06/10/whats-different-about-this-moment-primarily-number-americans-supporting-protests-over-racial-injustice/">great majority</a> of Americans have now rejected such silence. This is good. It remains an open question, however, when their silent acceptance of militarism, materialism, and the abuse of Planet Earth will end.</p>
