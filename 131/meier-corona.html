	<p class="intro">Just around my 76th birthday W.H.O. declared the “CORONA C0VID-19” a pandemic. Another 9/11 world-changing event, a George Orwell “1984 0.2”  in a much more insidious and sophisticated “Global Big Brother” form with frightening consequences coming toward us.</p>

	<p>I have been fortunate to find Rudolf Steiner's Anthroposophy at an early age. This has given me a solid life foundation and the ability to live my ideals in Biodynamic farming.</p>
	<p>One of the fundamentals is the concept of Karma and Reincarnation. Therefore the moment of my dying is pretty much set. As I have had many close encounters with death in farming, motorcycling and paragliding, a nasty virus is not going to scare me personally. I have reached the ripe age of 76 Years, am still quite healthy, but obviously with declining life forces. I consider that 70 Years is a full human life, anything beyond is a blessing (or a curse).  Death is the natural end of our physical presence on earth when we return to our real home, the spiritual world. </p>

	<p>The inability of objective clear thinking is caused by today's deficient education system and the brain-washing by the media from early childhood on. Bacteria and viruses are part of our biosphere and of our body, only imbalances and the weakening of our immune system create illness and, eventually, death. Fear of death weakens our immune system and is a gateway for disease and mental illness.</p>

	<p>French scientist Louis Pasteur (1822-1895) is widely celebrated as “the father of germ theory”— the idea that we become sick when our bodies are invaded by foreign organisms such as bacteria, molds, fungi, and of course viruses. What’s not widely known is that other French scientists working in the same field in that era held somewhat different beliefs, known as the “terrain theory”. They believed that the most important factor that determines whether or not a person becomes ill is not the presence of a germ, but rather the preparedness of the body’s internal environment (the “soil” or terrain) to repel or destroy the germ. </p>
	<p>We pollute our environment, destroy our natural resources, poison our soils, forests, water and wildlife, and grow and process deficient nutrition. </p>
	<p>In most flu seasons tens of thousands of people die in the U.S. each year of the flu. The 2017-2018 flu season was especially severe and killed some 80,000 people. Hospital emergency rooms had “standing-room only” and many flu patients had to be treated in the hallways, according to <span style="font-style:italic">Time magazine</span>.</p>
	<p>But during all these flu seasons we haven’t had to do “social distancing”, wear face masks or close down businesses and shut down the economy and impose a flu-related Soviet police state like we are getting with COVID-19 hysteria.</p>
	<p>The effect that COVID propaganda and fear-mongering has on the masses is tremendous. The news media do not mention that most of the people who die from COVID-19 are elderly and not just elderly but those with preexisting conditions and weakened immune systems. </p>
	<p>A recent Stanford University study confirms what we have already been told about the seriousness of the 2020 coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The study concluded that the virus is much more widespread and that a very high proportion of the population is infected with the virus. Nevertheless, most of the people who have it either develop “mild, flu-like symptoms” and recover, or they have no symptoms at all.  So in other words, COVID-19 is very much like the regular seasonal influenza, which is also contagious.</p>
	<p>This pandemic hysteria and global Lockdown has been initiated by the W.H.O, the pharmaceutical industry and the mainstream media. Statistics of infections and deaths are misleading, and rigged to  justify authoritarian measures and commercial profit seeking. A total global lockdown is absolutely insane and has catastrophic results in health, democracy and the economy. Critical experts are immediately marginalized by the "authorities" and the "mainstream" media. Any critique of the lockdown is met by hysterical enmity, by friends and family with accusations of right wing “conspiracy theorist” and a cruel disregard of the “death of millions”. The hypocrisy pretending to save lives is glaring while we permit the empire to lead untold wars worldwide, destroying the livelihood of millions and creating massive refugee streams disrupting national societies.</p>

	<p>In my view, the repercussions and ramifications of the unprecedented world-wide lockdown and how the fear-mongering will be used to control the populace is much scarier than a virus. While the the public is riddled with panic and fear over the spread of the coronavirus, a mass surveillance system far worse than that introduced after 9/11 is being built under the guise of protecting public health — all with public consent.</p>
	<p>One may drown in to deep despair from this situation, but can also hope that this could lead to a wake up and lead gradually to fundamental positive changes reversing the rapid decline of humanity.</p>
