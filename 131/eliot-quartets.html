	            <p style="font-weight:bold">I</p>

	            <p class="intro">Time present and time past<br>
	            Are both perhaps present in time future,<br>
	            And time future contained in time past.<br>
	            If all time is eternally present<br>
	            All time is unredeemable.<br>
	            What might have been is an abstraction<br>
	            Remaining a perpetual possibility<br>
	            Only in a world of speculation.<br>
	            What might have been and what has been<br>
	            Point to one end, which is always present.<br>
	            Footfalls echo in the memory<br>
	            Down the passage which we did not take<br>
	            Towards the door we never opened<br>
	            Into the rose-garden. My words echo<br>
	            Thus, in your mind.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
							But to what purpose<br>
	            Disturbing the dust on a bowl of rose-leaves<br>
	            I do not know.<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
							                        Other echoes<br>
	            Inhabit the garden. Shall we follow?<br>
	            Quick, said the bird, find them, find them,<br>
	            Round the corner. Through the first gate,<br>
	            Into our first world, shall we follow<br>
	            The deception of the thrush? Into our first world.<br>
	            There they were, dignified, invisible,<br>
	            Moving without pressure, over the dead leaves,<br>
	            In the autumn heat, through the vibrant air,<br>
	            And the bird called, in response to<br>
	            The unheard music hidden in the shrubbery,<br>
	            And the unseen eyebeam crossed, for the roses<br>
	            Had the look of flowers that are looked at.<br>
	            There they were as our guests, accepted and accepting.<br>
	            So we moved, and they, in a formal pattern,<br>
	            Along the empty alley, into the box circle,<br>
	            To look down into the drained pool.<br>
	            Dry the pool, dry concrete, brown edged,<br>
	            And the pool was filled with water out of sunlight,<br>
	            And the lotos rose, quietly, quietly,<br>
	            The surface glittered out of heart of light,<br>
	            And they were behind us, reflected in the pool.<br>
	            Then a cloud passed, and the pool was empty.<br>
	            Go, said the bird, for the leaves were full of children,<br>
	            Hidden excitedly, containing laughter.<br>
	            Go, go, go, said the bird: human kind<br>
	            Cannot bear very much reality.<br>
	            Time past and time future<br>
	            What might have been and what has been<br>
	            Point to one end, which is always present.</p>



	            <p style="font-weight:bold">II</p>

	            <p>Garlic and sapphires in the mud<br>
	            Clot the bedded axle-tree.<br>
	            The trilling wire in the blood<br>
	            Sings below inveterate scars<br>
	            Appeasing long forgotten wars.<br>
	            The dance along the artery<br>
	            The circulation of the lymph<br>
	            Are figured in the drift of stars<br>
	            Ascend to summer in the tree<br>
	            We move above the moving tree<br>
	            In light upon the figured leaf<br>
	            And hear upon the sodden floor<br>
	            Below, the boarhound and the boar<br>
	            Pursue their pattern as before<br>
	            But reconciled among the stars.</p>

	            <p>At the still point of the turning world. Neither flesh nor fleshless;<br>
	            Neither from nor towards; at the still point, there the dance is,<br>
	            But neither arrest nor movement. And do not call it fixity,<br>
	            Where past and future are gathered. Neither movement from nor towards,<br>
	            Neither ascent nor decline. Except for the point, the still point,<br>
	            There would be no dance, and there is only the dance.<br>
	            I can only say, there we have been: but I cannot say where.<br>
	            And I cannot say, how long, for that is to place it in time.<br>
	            The inner freedom from the practical desire,<br>
	            The release from action and suffering, release from the inner<br>
	            And the outer compulsion, yet surrounded<br>
	            By a grace of sense, a white light still and moving,<br>
	            Erhebung without motion, concentration<br>
	            Without elimination, both a new world<br>
	            And the old made explicit, understood<br>
	            In the completion of its partial ecstasy,<br>
	            The resolution of its partial horror.<br>
	            Yet the enchainment of past and future<br>
	            Woven in the weakness of the changing body,<br>
	            Protects mankind from heaven and damnation<br>
	            Which flesh cannot endure.<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	                                                      Time past and time future<br>
	            Allow but a little consciousness.<br>
	            To be conscious is not to be in time<br>
	            But only in time can the moment in the rose-garden,<br>
	            The moment in the arbour where the rain beat,<br>
	            The moment in the draughty church at smokefall<br>
	            Be remembered; involved with past and future.<br>
	            Only through time time is conquered.</p>



	            <p style="font-weight:bold">III</p>

	            <p>Here is a place of disaffection<br>
	            Time before and time after<br>
	            In a dim light: neither daylight<br>
	            Investing form with lucid stillness<br>
	            Turning shadow into transient beauty<br>
	            With slow rotation suggesting permanence<br>
	            Nor darkness to purify the soul<br>
	            Emptying the sensual with deprivation<br>
	            Cleansing affection from the temporal.<br>
	            Neither plenitude nor vacancy. Only a flicker<br>
	            Over the strained time-ridden faces<br>
	            Distracted from distraction by distraction<br>
	            Filled with fancies and empty of meaning<br>
	            Tumid apathy with no concentration<br>
	            Men and bits of paper, whirled by the cold wind<br>
	            That blows before and after time,<br>
	            Wind in and out of unwholesome lungs<br>
	            Time before and time after.<br>
	            Eructation of unhealthy souls<br>
	            Into the faded air, the torpid<br>
	            Driven on the wind that sweeps the gloomy hills of London,<br>
	            Hampstead and Clerkenwell, Campden and Putney,<br>
	            Highgate, Primrose and Ludgate. Not here<br>
	            Not here the darkness, in this twittering world.</p>

	            <p>	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Descend lower, descend only<br>
	            Into the world of perpetual solitude,<br>
	            World not world, but that which is not world,<br>
	            Internal darkness, deprivation<br>
	            And destitution of all property,<br>
	            Desiccation of the world of sense,<br>
	            Evacuation of the world of fancy,<br>
	            Inoperancy of the world of spirit;<br>
	            This is the one way, and the other<br>
	            Is the same, not in movement<br>
	            But abstention from movement; while the world moves<br>
	            In appetency, on its metalled ways<br>
	            Of time past and time future.</p>



	            <p style="font-weight:bold">IV</p>

	            <p>Time and the bell have buried the day,<br>
	            The black cloud carries the sun away.<br>
	            Will the sunflower turn to us, will the clematis<br>
	            Stray down, bend to us; tendril and spray<br>
	            Clutch and cling?</p>

	            <p>	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Chill<br>
	            Fingers of yew be curled<br>
	            Down on us? After the kingfisher's wing<br>
	            Has answered light to light, and is silent, the light is still<br>
	            At the still point of the turning world.</p>



	            <p style="font-weight:bold">V</p>

	            <p>Words move, music moves<br>
	            Only in time; but that which is only living<br>
	            Can only die. Words, after speech, reach<br>
	            Into the silence. Only by the form, the pattern,<br>
	            Can words or music reach<br>
	            The stillness, as a Chinese jar still<br>
	            Moves perpetually in its stillness.<br>
	            Not the stillness of the violin, while the note lasts,<br>
	            Not that only, but the co-existence,<br>
	            Or say that the end precedes the beginning,<br>
	            And the end and the beginning were always there<br>
	            Before the beginning and after the end.<br>
	            And all is always now. Words strain,<br>
	            Crack and sometimes break, under the burden,<br>
	            Under the tension, slip, slide, perish,<br>
	            Decay with imprecision, will not stay in place,<br>
	            Will not stay still. Shrieking voices<br>
	            Scolding, mocking, or merely chattering,<br>
	            Always assail them. The Word in the desert<br>
	            Is most attacked by voices of temptation,<br>
	            The crying shadow in the funeral dance,<br>
	            The loud lament of the disconsolate chimera.</p>

	            <p> 	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   The detail of the pattern is movement,<br>
	            As in the figure of the ten stairs.<br>
	            Desire itself is movement<br>
	            Not in itself desirable;<br>
	            Love is itself unmoving,<br>
	            Only the cause and end of movement,<br>
	            Timeless, and undesiring<br>
	            Except in the aspect of time<br>
	            Caught in the form of limitation<br>
	            Between un-being and being.<br>
	            Sudden in a shaft of sunlight<br>
	            Even while the dust moves<br>
	            There rises the hidden laughter<br>
	            Of children in the foliage<br>
	            Quick now, here, now, always�<br>
	            Ridiculous the waste sad time<br>
	            Stretching before and after.</p>
