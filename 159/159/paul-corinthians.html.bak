<h1>First Letter of Paul to the Corinthians</h1>
<p><img src="greek-letter.jpg" class="a" /></p>
<p class="intro">If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not
love,<br />
I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.<br />
And if I have prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and
all<br />
knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains,<br />
but have not love, I am nothing.<br />
If I give away all I have, and if I deliver up my body to be
burned,<br />
but have not love, I gain nothing.<br />
Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast;<br />
it is not arrogant or rude.<br />
It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or
resentful;<br />
it does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth.<br />
Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things,<br />
endures all things. Love never ends.<br />
As for prophecies, they will pass way.<br />
For we know partially and we prophesy partially,<br />
but when the perfect comes, the partial will pass away.<br />
When I was a child, I used to talk as a child, think as a child,<br />
reason as a child; when I became a man, I put aside childish
things.<br />
At present we see indistinctly, as in a mirror, but then face to
face.<br />
At present I know partially; then I shall know fully, as I am
fully<br />
known.<br />
So now faith, hope, and love remain, these three;<br />
but the greatest of these is love.</p>
<h3>Love's Letter</h3>

<h2>by Frank Thomas Smith</h2>
<p class="intropoem">My sister Faith was first to go,<br />
Her blood was staunched and ceased to flow.<br />
Never was she the worldly type,<br />
And won't return till time is ripe.<br />
My other sister's name is Hope;<br />
Never was she one to mope.<br />
Her eyes, once fawn's, now sadly droop,<br />
She walks with an ancient's wary stoop.<br />
Hard it'll be to linger on<br />
When blissful sister Hope is gone.<br />
Retreat I'll then, I'll take cover,<br />
With my ever-constant lover.<br />
A generation will rise and when<br />
My sisters will be born again,<br />
They'll care too much not to persist,<br />
Hope's trembling lips insist.<br />
We three will roam the world's wide web<br />
Repeating what the Savior said,<br />
We'll cast away our mourning clothes,<br />
Leave them where the wild rose grows:<br />
Being heard above the din,<br />
Calling out and drawing in,<br />
Welcoming the circling dove,<br />
Honoring the name of Love.<br />
The Evil One will be here too,<br />
Our waking giving him the cue<br />
His wicked efforts to redouble.<br />
The world will groan: toil and trouble!<br />
Perhaps too few will we three be.<br />
Faith, Hope and Love agree<br />
That human help is needed sorely,<br />
That gods alone must render poorly.</p>
