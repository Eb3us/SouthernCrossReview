<p>Translated from the Russian by Mrs. Sutherland Edwards</p>
<h4>CHAPTER I</h4>
<p class="intro">There was a card party at the rooms of Narumoff, a lieutenant in the
Horse Guards. A long winter night had passed unnoticed, and it was five
o'clock in the morning when supper was served. The winners sat down to
table with an excellent appetite; the losers let their plates remain
empty before them. Little by little, however, with the assistance of the
champagne, the conversation became animated, and was shared by all.</p>
<p>"How did you get on this evening, Surin?" said the host to one of his
friends.</p>
<p>"Oh, I lost, as usual. I really have no luck. I play
<em>mirandole</em>. You know that I keep cool. Nothing moves me; I never
change my play, and yet I always lose."</p>
<p>"Do you mean to say that all the evening you did not once back the
red? Your firmness of character surprises me."</p>
<p>"What do you think of Hermann?" said one of the party, pointing to a
young Engineer officer.</p>
<p>"That fellow never made a bet or touched a card in his life, and yet
he watches us playing until five in the morning."</p>
<p>"It interests me," said Hermann; "but I am not disposed to risk the
necessary in view of the superfluous."</p>
<p>"Hermann is a German, and economical; that is the whole of the
secret," cried Tomski. "But what is really astonishing is the Countess
Anna Fedotovna!"</p>
<p>"How so?" asked several voices.</p>
<p>"Have you not remarked," said Tomski, "that she never plays?"</p>
<p>"Yes," said Narumoff, "a woman of eighty, who never touches a card;
that is indeed something extraordinary!"</p>
<p>"You do not know why?"</p>
<p>"No; is there a reason for it?"</p>
<p>"Just listen. My grandmother, you know, some sixty years ago, went to
Paris, and became the rage there. People ran after her in the streets,
and called her the 'Muscovite Venus.' Richelieu made love to her, and my
grandmother makes out that, by her rigorous demeanour, she almost drove
him to suicide. In those days women used to play at faro. One evening at
the court she lost, on <em>parole,</em> to the Duke of Orleans, a very
considerable sum. When she got home, my grandmother removed her beauty
spots, took off her hoops, and in this tragic costume went to my
grandfather, told him of her misfortune, and asked him for the money she
had to pay. My grandfather, now no more, was, so to say, his wife's
steward. He feared her like fire; but the sum she named made him leap
into the air. He flew into a rage, made a brief calculation, and proved
to my grandmother that in six months she had got through half a million
rubles. He told her plainly that he had no villages to sell in Paris,
his domains being situated in the neighbourhood of Moscow and of
Saratoff; and finally refused point blank. You may imagine the fury of
my grandmother. She boxed his ears, and passed the night in another
room.</p>
<p>The next day she returned to the charge. For the first time in her
life, she condescended to arguments and explanations. In vain did she
try to prove to her husband that there were debts and debts, and that
she could not treat a prince of the blood like her coachmaker.</p>
<p>"All this eloquence was lost. My grandfather was inflexible. My
grandmother did not know where to turn. Happily she was acquainted with
a man who was very celebrated at this time. You have heard of the Count
of St. Germain, about whom so many marvellous stories were told. You
know that he passed for a sort of Wandering Jew, and that he was said to
possess an elixir of life and the philosopher's stone.</p>
<p>"Some people laughed at him as a charlatan. Casanova, in his memoirs,
says that he was a spy. However that may be, in spite of the mystery of
his life, St. Germain was much sought after in good society, and was
really an agreeable man. Even to this day my grandmother has preserved a
genuine affection for him, and she becomes quite angry when anyone
speaks of him with disrespect.</p>
<p>"It occurred to her that he might be able to advance the sum of which
she was in need, and she wrote a note begging him to call. The old
magician came at once, and found her plunged in the deepest despair. In
two or three words she told him everything; related to him her
misfortune and the cruelty of her husband, adding that she had no hope
except in his friendship and his obliging disposition.</p>
<p>"'Madam,' said St. Germain, after a few moments' reflection, 'I could
easily advance you the money you want, but I am sure that you would have
no rest until you had repaid me, and I do not want to get you out of one
trouble in order to place you in another. There is another way of
settling the matter. You must regain the money you have lost.'</p>
<p>"'But, my dear friend,' answered my grandmother, 'I have already told
you that I have nothing left.'</p>
<p>"'That does not matter,' answered St. Germain. 'Listen to me, and I
will explain.'</p>
<p>"He then communicated to her a secret which any of you would, I am
sure, give a good deal to possess."</p>
<p>All the young officers gave their full attention. Tomski stopped to
light his Turkish pipe, swallowed a mouthful of smoke, and then went
on.</p>
<p>"That very evening my grandmother went to Versailles to play at the
Queen's table. The Duke of Orleans held the bank. My grandmother
invented a little story by way of excuse for not having paid her debt,
and then sat down at the table, and began to stake. She took three
cards. She won with the first; doubled her stake on the second, and won
again; doubled on the third, and still won."</p>
<p>"Mere luck!" said one of the young officers.</p>
<p>"What a tale!" cried Hermann.</p>
<p>"Were the cards marked?" said a third.</p>
<p>"I don't think so," replied Tomski, gravely.</p>
<p>"And you mean to say," exclaimed Narumoff, "that you have a
grandmother who knows the names of three winning cards, and you have
never made her tell them to you?"</p>
<p>"That is the very deuce of it," answered Tomski. "She had three sons,
of whom my father was one; all three were determined gamblers, and not
one of them was able to extract her secret from her, though it would
have been of immense advantage to them, and to me also. Listen to what
my uncle told me about it, Count Ivan Ilitch, and he told me on his word
of honour.</p>
<p>"Tchaplitzki—the one you remember who died in poverty after devouring
millions—lost one day, when he was a young man, to Zoritch about three
hundred thousand roubles. He was in despair. My grandmother, who had no
mercy for the extravagance of young men, made an exception—I do not know
why—in favour of Tchaplitzki. She gave him three cards, telling him to
play them one after the other, and exacting from him at the same time
his word of honour that he would never afterwards touch a card as long
as he lived. Accordingly Tchaplitzki went to Zoritch and asked for his
revenge. On the first card he staked fifty thousands rubles. He won,
doubled the stake, and won again. Continuing his system he ended by
gaining more than he had lost.</p>
<p>"But it is six o'clock! It is really time to go to bed."</p>
<p>Everyone emptied his glass and the party broke up.</p>
<h4>CHAPTER II.</h4>
<p class="intropoem">The old Countess Anna Fedotovna was in her dressing-room, seated
before her looking-glass. Three maids were in attendance. One held her
pot of rouge, another a box of black pins, a third an enormous lace cap,
with flaming ribbons. The Countess had no longer the slightest pretense
to beauty, but she preserved all the habits of her youth. She dressed in
the style of fifty years before, and gave as much time and attention to
her toilet as a fashionable beauty of the last century. Her companion
was working at a frame in a corner of the window.</p>
<p>“Good morning, grandmother," said the young officer, as he entered
the dressing-room. "Good morning, Mademoiselle Lise. Grandmother, I have
come to ask you a favour."</p>
<p>"What is it, Paul?"</p>
<p>"I want to introduce to you one of my friends, and to ask you to give
him an invitation to your ball."</p>
<p>"Bring him to the ball and introduce him to me there. Did you go
yesterday to the Princess's?"</p>
<p>"Certainly. It was delightful! We danced until five o'clock in the
morning. Mademoiselle Eletzki was charming."</p>
<p>"My dear nephew, you are really not difficult to please. As to
beauty, you should have seen her grandmother, the Princess Daria
Petrovna. But she must be very old the Princess Daria Petrovna!"</p>
<p>"How do you mean old?" cried Tomski thoughtlessly; "she died seven
years ago."</p>
<p>The young lady who acted as companion raised her head and made a sign
to the officer, who then remembered that it was an understood thing to
conceal from the Princess the death of any of her contemporaries. He bit
his lips. The Countess, however, was not in any way disturbed on hearing
that her old friend was no longer in this world.</p>
<p>"Dead!" she said, "and I never knew it! We were maids of honour in
the same year, and when we were presented, the Empress'"—and the old
Countess related for the hundredth time an anecdote of her young days.
"Paul," she said, as she finished her story, "help me to get up.
Lisaveta, where is my snuff-box?"</p>
<p>And, followed by the three maids, she went behind a great screen to
finish her toilet. Tomski was now alone with the companion.</p>
<p>"Who is the gentleman you wish to introduce to madame?" asked
Lisaveta.</p>
<p>"Narumoff. Do you know him?"</p>
<p>"No. Is he in the army?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"In the Engineers?"</p>
<p>"No, in the Horse Guards. Why did you think he was in the
Engineers?"</p>
<p>The young lady smiled, but made no answer.</p>
<p>"Paul," cried the Countess from behind the screen, "send me a new
novel; no matter what. Only see that it is not in the style of the
present day."</p>
<p>"What style would you like, grandmother?"</p>
<p>"A novel in which the hero strangles neither his father nor his
mother, and in which no one gets drowned. Nothing frightens me so much
as the idea of getting drowned."</p>
<p>“But how is it possible to find you such a book? Do you want it in
Russian?"</p>
<p>"Are there any novels in Russian? However, send me something or
other. You won't forget?"</p>
<p>"I will not forget, grandmother. I am in a great hurry. Good-bye,
Lisaveta. What made you fancy Narumoff was in the Engineers?" and Tomski
took his departure.</p>
<p>Lisaveta, left alone, took out her embroidery, and sat down close to
the window. Immediately afterwards, in the street, at the corner of a
neighbouring house, appeared a young officer. The sight of him made the
companion blush to her ears. She lowered her head, and almost concealed
it in the canvas. At this moment the Counters returned, fully
dressed.</p>
<p>"Lisaveta," she said "have the horses put in; we will go out for a
drive."</p>
<p>Lisaveta rose from her chair, and began to arrange her
embroidery.</p>
<p>"Well, my dear child, are you deaf? Go and tell them to put the
horses in at once."</p>
<p>"I am going," replied the young lady, as she went out into the
ante-chamber.</p>
<p>A servant now came in, bringing some books from Prince Paul
Alexandrovitch.</p>
<p>"Say I am much obliged to him. Lisaveta! Lisaveta! Where has she run
off to?"</p>
<p>"I was going to dress."</p>
<p>"We have plenty of time, my dear. Sit down, take the first volume,
and read to me."</p>
<p>The companion took the book and read a few lines.</p>
<p>"Louder," said the Countess. "What is the matter with you? Have you a
cold? Wait a moment; bring me that stool. A little closer; that will
do."</p>
<p>Lisaveta read two pages of the book.</p>
<p>"Throw that stupid book away," said the Countess. "What nonsense!
Send it back to Prince Paul, and tell him I am much obliged to him; and
the carriage, is it never coming?</p>
<p>"Here it is," replied Lisaveta, going to the window.</p>
<p>"And now you are not dressed. Why do you always keep 'me waiting? It
is intolerable."</p>
<p>Lisaveta ran to her room. She had scarcely been there two minutes
when the Countess rang with all her might. Her maids rushed in at one
door and her valet at the other.</p>
<p>"You do not seem to hear me when I ring," she cried. "Go and tell
Lisaveta that I am waiting for her."</p>
<p>At this moment Lisaveta entered, wearing a new walking dress and a
fashionable bonnet.</p>
<p>"At last, miss," cried the Countess. "But what is that you have got
on? and why? For whom are you dressing? What sort of weather is it?
Quite stormy, I believe."</p>
<p>"No, your Excellency," said the valet; "it is exceedingly fine."</p>
<p>"What do you know about it? Open the ventilator. Just what I told
you! A frightful wind, and as icy as can be. Unharness the horses.
Lisaveta, my child, we will not go out to-day. It was scarcely worth
while to dress so much."</p>
<p>"What an existence!" said the companion to herself.</p>
<p>Lisaveta Ivanovna was, in fact, a most unhappy creature. "The bread
of the stranger is bitter," says Dante, "and his staircase hard to
climb." But who can tell the torments of a poor little companion
attached to an old lady of quality? The Countess had all the caprices of
a woman spoilt by the world. She was avaricious and egotistical, and
thought all the more of herself now that she had ceased to play an
active part in society. She never missed a ball, and she dressed and
painted in the style of a bygone age. She remained in a corner of the
room, where she seemed to have been placed expressly to serve as a
scarecrow. Every one on coming in went to her and made her a low bow,
but this ceremony once at an end no one spoke a word to her. She
received the whole city at her house, observing the strictest etiquette,
and never failing to give to everyone his or her proper name. Her
innumerable servants, growing pale and fat in the ante-chamber, did
absolutely as they liked, so that the house was pillaged as if its owner
were really dead. Lisaveta passed her life in continual torture. If she
made tea she was reproached with wasting the sugar. If she read a novel
to the Countess she was held responsible for all the absurdities of the
author. If she went out with the noble lady for a walk or drive, it was
she who was to blame if the weather was bad or the pavement muddy. Her
salary, more than modest, was never punctually paid, and she was
expected to dress "like everyone else," that is to say, like very few
people indeed. When she went into society her position was sad. Everyone
knew her; no one paid her any attention. At a ball she sometimes danced,
but only when a <em>vis-à-vis</em> was wanted. Women would come up to
her, take her by the arm, and lead her out of the room if their dress
required attending to. She had her portion of self-respect, and felt
deeply the misery of her position. She looked with impatience for a
liberator to break her chain. But the young men, prudent in the midst of
their affected giddiness, took care not to honour her with their
attentions, though Lisaveta Ivanovna was a hundred times prettier than
the shameless or stupid girls whom they surrounded with their homage.
More than once she slunk away from the splendour of the drawing-room to
shut herself up alone in her little bed-room, furnished with an old
screen and a pieced carpet, a chest of drawers, a small looking-glass,
and a wooden bedstead. There she shed tears at her ease by the light of
a tallow candle in a tin candlestick.</p>
<p>One morning—it was two days after the party at Narumoff's, and a week
before the scene we have just sketched—Lisaveta was sitting at her
embroidery before the window, when, looking carelessly into the street,
she saw an officer, in the uniform of the Engineers, standing motionless
with his eyes fixed upon her. She lowered her head, and applied herself
to her work more attentively than ever. Five minutes afterwards she
locked mechanically into the street, and the officer was still in the
same place. Not being in the habit of exchanging glances with young men
who passed by her window, she remained with her eyes fixed on her work
for nearly two hours, until she was told that lunch was ready. She got
up to put her embroidery away, and while doing so, looked into the
street, and saw the officer still in the same place. This seemed to her
very strange. After lunch she went to the window with a certain emotion,
but the officer of Engineers was no longer in the street.</p>
<p>She thought no more of him. But two days afterwards, just as she was
getting into the carriage with the Countess, she saw him once more,
standing straight before the door. His face was half concealed by a fur
collar, but his black eyes sparkled beneath his helmet. Lisaveta was
afraid, without knowing why, and she trembled as she took her seat in
the carriage.</p>
<p>On returning home, she rushed with a beating heart towards the
window. The officer was in his habitual place, with his eyes fixed
ardently upon her. She at once withdrew, burning at the same time with
curiosity, and moved by a strange feeling which she now experienced for
the first time.</p>
<p>No day now passed but the young officer showed himself beneath the
window. Before long a dumb acquaintance was established between them.
Sitting at her work she felt his presence, and when she raised her head
she looked at him for a long time every day. The young man seemed full
of gratitude for these innocent favours.</p>
<p>She observed, with the deep and rapid perceptions of youth, that a
sudden redness covered the officer's pale cheeks as soon as their eyes
met. After about a week she would smile at seeing him for the first
time.</p>
<p>When Tomski asked his grandmother's permission to present one of his
friends, the heart of the poor young girl beat strongly, and when she
heard that it was Narumoff, she bitterly repented having compromised her
secret by letting it out to a giddy young man like Paul.</p>
<p>Hermann was the son of a German settled in Russia, from whom he had
inherited a small sum of money. Firmly resolved to preserve his
independence, he had made it a principle not to touch his private
income. He lived on his pay, and did not allow himself the slightest
luxury. He was not very communicative; and his reserve rendered it
difficult for his comrades to amuse themselves at his expense.</p>
<p>Under an assumed calm he concealed strong passions and a highly
imaginative disposition. But he was always master of himself, and kept
himself free from the ordinary faults of young men. Thus, a gambler by
temperament, he never touched a card, feeling, as he himself said, that
his position did not allow him to "risk the necessary in view of the
superfluous." Yet he would pass entire nights before a card-table,
watching with feverish anxiety the rapid changes of the game. The
anecdote of Count St. Germaine's three cards had struck his imagination,
and he did nothing but think of it all that night.</p>
<p>"If," he said to himself next day as he was walking along the streets
of St. Petersburg, "if she would only tell me her secret—if she would
only name the three winning cards! I must get presented to her, that I
may pay my court and gain her confidence. Yes! And she is eighty-seven!
She may die this week—to-morrow perhaps. But after all, is there a word
of truth in the story? No! Economy, Temperance, Work; these are my three
winning cards. With them I can double my capital; increase it tenfold.
They alone can ensure my independence and prosperity."</p>
<p>Dreaming in this way as he walked along, his attention was attracted
by a house built in an antiquated style of architecture. The street was
full of carriages, which passed one by one before the old house, now
brilliantly illuminated. As the people stepped out of the carriages
Hermann saw now the little feet of a young woman, now the military boot
of a general. Then came a clocked stocking; then, again, a diplomatic
pump. Fur-lined cloaks and coats passed in procession before a gigantic
porter.</p>
<p>Hermann stopped. "Who lives here?" he said to a watchman in his
box.</p>
<p>"The Countess Anna Fedotovna." It was Tomski's grandmother.</p>
<p>Hermann started. The story of the three cards came once more upon his
imagination. He walked to and fro before the house, thinking of the
woman to whom it belonged, of her wealth and her mysterious power. At
last he returned to his den. But for some time he could not get to
sleep; and when at last sleep came upon him, he saw, dancing before his
eyes, cards, a green table, and heaps of rubles and bank-notes. He saw
himself doubling stake after stake, always winning, and then filling his
pockets with piles of coin, and stuffing his pocket-book with countless
bank-notes. When he awoke, he sighed to find that his treasures were but
creations of a disordered fancy; and, to drive such thoughts from him,
he went out for a walk. But he had not gone far when he found himself
once more before the house of the Countess. He seemed to have been
attracted there by some irresistible force. He stopped, and looked up at
the windows. There he saw a girl's head with beautiful black hair,
leaning gracefully over a book or an embroidery-frame. The head was
lifted, and he saw a fresh complexion and black eyes.</p>
<p>This moment decided his fate.</p>
