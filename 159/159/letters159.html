<p>RE: <a href="https://southerncrossreview.org/159/engelhardt-trump-from-hell.html">The Candidate from Hell</a> by Tom Engelhardt</p>
<p>Quite disappointed to have you take an overtly political
fear-mongering stance. If it was more truthful, you'd also have included
Kamala as the other candidate from hell. I'm no republican and certainly
no democrat, but there is truth about the scam labeled as "green". taxes
taxes taxes. marketing. green washing. Humans are out of their depths
thinking "green" will help the planet. What will help the planet is
love, reverence for one another, and knowing the American political show
is a great illusion. Breaking down of giant corporations, holding
corporate entities accountable to the major harm that <em>they</em>
cause the planet. it is a lack of corporate responsibility, these
businesses tricking the individual that it is <em>their</em> fault, that
only if each individual would recycle and compost, we could reverse
"climate change". All the while corporations get away with oil spills,
get bailed out by taxpayer's dollars, continuing to wrap their products
in oil. Trump is a symptom, not a cause of the illness of the world.
Kamala is a fool who will be paid to do the biddings of the NWO.</p>
<p>both represent the dissillusions of the american people, both
represent the lack of intelligence, lack of heart, and humanity's fall
in relationship with God.</p>
<p>i will be unsubscribing and wish you had taken a more nuanced
position.</p>
<p>May god save us all,</p>

<p>RE: <a href="https://southerncrossreview.org/76/steiner-judaism.html">Characteristics of Judaism and Zionism</a> by Rudolf Steiner</p>
<p>O ye gods!</p>
<p>Thank you for distributing this lecture. Can you tell us the
audience, date and location of this lecture?</p>
<p>As a Jewish person (and something of a Jewish Mystic at 8 years old),
a 50 year student of Anthroposophy with 16 years of Waldorf Class
Teaching, married and participating in the Christian Community, I can
concur with much of what Steiner puts forth. Yes, the 10 commandments
were very clear that the people of the covenant were prohibited to make
images of God (or people). But Steiner misses a cardinal piece of the
story. As you know well, not only did the Rabbi’s work to preserve the
covenant of the Jewish relationship to Yahweh through the Torah, Talmud
and Mishnah and even the Kabbalah, but the Christian world persecuted
and separated the Jewish people from the rest of the Christian World and
prevented us from assimilating into the fullness of humanity. (See the
book: The Sword of Constantine by the former priest, James Carroll). And
the Holocaust is a primary example of the prevention of those of Jewish
extraction to assimilate and even adopt Christianity. And of course
Steiner was wrong about the principal of universal humanity (as evidence
by German (especially) racism. The Jewish people never lost their
connection to Israel - “Next year in Jerusalem.” And after the barbarous
murder of 6 million Jewish people, no country wanted the survivors.
Zionism grew as a force that grew out of the soil of Christian hatred
and murderousness and the conviction that the Jewish people killed
Christ, did it not? Seems to me that Steiner was blind to the realities
that the Jewish people faced. And for those Jews who followed Steiner’s
conviction that the Jewish people remain in Germany, it was the ovens
that awaited them.</p>
<p>And who were the first Christians but those Jewish people who
recognized Christ.</p>
<p>I know this is a complicated story, but Steiner, it seems to me, saw
one piece of that story and was blind to the overwhelming history that
kept the Jewish people as victims of Christian hatred.</p>
<p>I would also note that although the Jewish people were artists in the
field of music and less inclined and talented in the visual arts there
were notable exceptions, amongst whom were:</p>
<p>Marc Chagall, Daniel Moritz Oppenheim, Camille Pissaro, Max
Weber, Boris Schatz established the Bezalel School, an institute to
train painters and sculptors in fine art techniques, Nahum Gutman, Judy
Chicago, Malcah Zeldis, Ahron ben Shmuel, Jacques Lipchitz, Camille
Pissarro.</p>
<p>And a number of notable women artists as well.</p>
<p>It should be said that many of these were impressionistic or
expressionistic abstract artists, no doubt influenced by the prohibition
against creating images of human or divine beings. And what about
Islam’s prohibition against representing human or divine images.</p>
<p>I know this is a little rambling, but as a Jewish person I admit I am
sensitive to portrayal of the Jewish people as backward remnants of a
people once relevant but no longer.</p>
<p>Thank you again for this lecture, and I look forward to your own
thoughts.</p>

<p>Hermoso cuento. No entiendo cómo no te han dado el Nobel de
literatura. Quizás se lo dieron a tu otro yo en un universo
paralelo.</p>
