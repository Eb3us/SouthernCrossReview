<h3>Chapter 16</h3>

<h3>The White Stone</h3>

</header>

<main>
<p class="intro">Food was no problem in Maxalabora. One of the boys had only to stand
on Platero's back and reach up to pluck tropical fruit from the trees.
The was also a grape-like berry that grew on silver-colored bushes. They
liked these best because of their exquisite sweetness. Even Platero ate
them from Divines hand. Sergio said he had never heard of a donkey
eating grapes before and Divino replied that no one had ever heard of a
donkey that flew over chasms either. They agreed that Platero was an
extraordinary donkey.</p>
<p>There was still no proper path to follow, so they continued heading
south hoping for some clue to indicate where they should go. They were
especially attentive to their surroundings at sunset, for they
remembered how the raven's verse continued:</p>
      <blockquote>
<p><em>When the setting sun you spy<br />
Mark where the arc is high,<br />
Go to where the star is nigh…</em></p>
      </blockquote>
<p>The first evening at sunset they saw nothing like an arc. The second
night was no different. Divino mentioned Tamoshot several times, hoping
he would appear unexpectedly as he had before. But Tamoshot did not come
to show them the way. On the third day it rained. No water could get
through their tararobes, but the ground became soggy and the going was
more difficult. A thick fog descended over the forest and it got dark
early because of the fog and rain. They were lucky to find a relatively
comfortable place to spend the night between the exposed roots of a huge
tree. Just as they were settling down to a miserable night the rain
stopped and a wind rose that blew away the fog. They saw the sun set in
the west. Then:</p>
<p>"Look, Sergio!" In the southwest a rainbow sparkled like a necklace
on the sky's throat. They jumped up and stared, stunned by its
beauty.</p>
<p>"The arc, Divino, it's the arc," Sergio exclaimed. <em>When the
setting sun you spy</em> - there, we spied it." He pointed to the place
where the sun was sinking below the forest. "<em>Mark where the</em>
<em>arc</em> - the rainbow - <em>is high</em>. The rainbow's highest
point is its center, so if we look down from there. Look, the star!"</p>
<p>Divino followed his brother's finger and, sure enough, he saw a star
twinkling in the half-circle formed by the rainbow.</p>
<p><em>Go to where the star is nigh</em> he murmured. "What does
<em>nigh</em> mean, Sergio?"</p>
<p>"Near."</p>
<p>"But how can we get near to a star?"</p>
<p>Sergio crept along the heavy roots of the tree they were under until
he came to its trunk. He jumped up to the lowest branch and swung
himself up. From there it was not difficult to climb from limb to limb
until he was high enough to see over the forest, for that tree was the
tallest of them all. He peered at the fading rainbow and the star.</p>
<p>"What do you see?" Divino called.</p>
<p>"I know now where we have to go," Sergio answered. "It's so beautiful
up here that I could stay all night."</p>
<p>Divino would have liked to climb up too, but he knew that he couldn't
reach the tree's lowest branch, so he waited with Platero until Sergio
came down. It was dark when he did. He smiled and dropped down onto a
thick root next to Divino.</p>
<p>"Under the star is a hill and on the hill is something that looks
like a white stone."</p>
<p>"A white stone?"</p>
<p>"Don't you see? The star is nigh to that white stone, at least it
appears to be. In reality it's millions of light-years away."</p>
<p>Divino believed his brother more than he understood him. He
nodded.</p>
<p>"That's where we must go," Sergio said.</p>
<p>"Where?"</p>
<p>"To the white stone."</p>
<p>The next day was clear and shining and raindrops still dripped from
the leaves above them. After walking about an hour Sergio decided to
climb a tree in order to get a bearing on the white stone. This time he
chose a tree without thick exposed roots so Divino could stand on
Platero's back and climb up behind him. The tree was not as tall as the
first one, but it was tall enough for them to see the hill. They went as
high as they could, but did not see the white stone. Divino said it
might only be visible at night. Sergio was doubtful. There was no moon
and the star was too far away to shed much light on the stone.</p>
<p>They climbed down and continued in what Sergio thought was the
general direction of the hill. When night fell and the star appeared
again, this time without the rainbow, they climbed a tall tree. From its
top they saw the white stone glowing in the dark. It was still far away
but closer than the night before. They took its bearing mentally and
retired for the night.</p>
<p>In this way they went through the forest for two more days,
correcting their course by taking bearings on the white stone at night.
On the third day, while it was still light, they reached the hill, the
only one for miles around. There were many gray stones on the hill and
they all looked alike except for size. Divino suggested that they wait
for nightfall and see which stone receives the star's light and turns
white. Sergio explained that the star would shine on all the stones
equally, but he saw no alternative, so they made themselves comfortable
on the hill and waited.</p>
<p>At twilight the star appeared in the east. The sat watching it for
hours as it rose in the sky. "Look, Sergio," Divino whispered, pointing
to their right. Sergio looked and saw a large stone take on an eerie
glow. They ran over to it while Platero stood where he was grazing.
Markings in the stones became clearer as the star approached mid-sky
directly over them. Then they saw that they were letters. Sergio wanted
to copy them because he feared they might disappear once the star
passed. But he had nothing to write with.</p>
<p>"Tamoshot wrote on the ground," Divino said.</p>
<p>Sergio picked up a stick lying nearby and carefully scratched the
letters in the earth. What he wrote looked like this:</p>
      <blockquote>
<p>TEL HET FOREBE U YPAL<br />
LITUN HET TIGHN IS ENOD<br />
OT TURNER LESTEC HET ESTSHORT YAW<br />
DRAWTOS HET SIRING NUS</p>
      </blockquote>
<p>While Sergio was copying the letters, Divino sat in front of the
white stone gazing at the glowing letters. When Sergio finished he saw
that Divino's head was on his chest and he had fallen asleep. Sergio
smiled affectionately and eased his brother into a more comfortable
sleeping position on the ground. It had been a long day and Sergio was
also feeling sleepy. He suspected it had something to do with the
glowing stone. Finally he decided to lie down before he fell down and
was immediately asleep. Platero was the only one of the three still
awake. He continued eating until he was satisfied and finally slept
without the help of the white stone, which he had barely noticed.</p>
<p>In the morning the song birds woke the boys and the donkey at the
same time. "I dreamed about the white stone," Divino said, rubbing the
sleep from his eyes. Sergio waited expectantly, knowing that his brother
often had meaningful dreams. "The stone was all lit up and the letters
were blinking on and off in red and yellow," Divino said, trying hard to
remember his dream. "Tamoshot was here writing on the ground." He went
to the place where Sergio had scratched the stone's markings. "You were
right, Sergio. Look, the letters have disappeared from the stone.</p>
<p>Sergio nodded, he had already noticed that. He was waiting for Divino
to continue describing his dream. "While the letters were blinking on
and off this word" - he pointed to HET in the first line, then to the
same word in the third line - "wasn't HET, but 231."</p>
<p>"That's all?" Sergio asked.</p>
<p>"I think so, that's all I can remember anyway."</p>
<p>Sergio knelt down in front of the letters he had scratched on the
ground the night before.</p>
<p>"What does it mean, Sergio?" Although Divino had the dreams, it was
Sergio who could interpret them. He wrote 321 over the letters HET in
each of the three lines where they appeared. He knit his brow: "It H is
2 and E is 3 and T is 1, we should write the word like this. He rubbed
out 321 and put THE in its place.</p>
<p>"That's a real word, Sergio."</p>
<p>"Yes, the letters seem to be all mixed up. Was that the only word
that flashed numbers in the dream? Divino confirmed that it was so
Sergio began to play with the letters in each grouping, trying to make
sense out of them.</p>
<p>"TEL could be LET, which could mean LET THE...RATS...BEFORE...YOU
PLAY." It didn't take him long to solve the cryptogram:</p>
      <blockquote>
<p>LET THE RATS BEFORE YOU PLAY<br />
UNTIL THE NIGHT IS DONE<br />
TO RETURN SELECT THE SHORTEST WAY<br />
TOWARDS THE RISING SUN</p>
      </blockquote>
<p>The word TOWARDS gave him the most trouble, but when he finished he
sat back quite pleased with himself. He read it to Divino.</p>
<p>"What rats?" Divino wanted to know.</p>
<p>"I don't know. We'll just have to keep our eyes open for them."</p>
<p>"I don't like rats."</p>
<p>"Neither do I, but that's what it says."</p>
<p>Divino wasn't very good at deciphering cryptograms. Nevertheless, he
studied the words scratched in the ground until his head hurt. Finally
he smiled, wet his finger as he had often seen Dona Ute do when she was
turning pages and wrote, not scratched but wrote in a thin layer of
dust: S T A R, which is RATS in reverse.</p>
<p>Sergio stared. "Of course, STAR, you're right, Divino. LET THE
<em>STAR</em> BEFORE YOU PLAY." He patted Divino on the back, which
pleased him very much as he didn't often receive praise from Sergio.
"What does it mean?" he asked.</p>
<p>"That we should keep following the star at night."</p>
<p>"Can't we walk during the day and check at night?"</p>
<p>"I don't think so. The instructions are clear and we should follow
them."</p>
<p>Divino didn't see why, but he knew his brother was usually right, so
he nodded and said, "How about breakfast?"</p>
