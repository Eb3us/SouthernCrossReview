	<p><strong>Brooklyn Prep</strong></p>
      <br />
<p class="intro">Sometimes you make a choice that fails. The result may be positive or
negative or simply meaningless. The failure of this choice was positive,
although I didn't realize it until much later.</p>
<p>Upon graduating from elementary school, P.S. 152, I applied for
admission to Brooklyn Preparatory High School. I don't remember why,
although it was probably because some friend convinced me that it was
cool and small and had a good but humble football team. It was located
in downtown Brooklyn, so would require a trolley-bus trip to and from
every day. This didn't bother me, on the contrary I rather looked
forward to it. I had to take an admission test, which didn't bother me
either, because until then I had found school examinations easy. Much
later I came to suspect that the teachers who prepared them feared their
teaching ability would appear incompetent if many students failed, in
the public schools at least.</p>
<p>I remember only one question on the Brooklyn Prep test — in
mathematics or, rather, arithmetic — that I had a problem with. It asked
to solve a half dozen square roots — numbers with a symbol that looks
like a fishhook (√). I had no idea how to do that, most likely because I
was playing hooky on the day we learned about square roots in P.S. 152.
Just to put something, I divided all the numbers by two, knowing it was
incorrect. A week or two later, I received a letter from the school
informing me that I had passed the test with around 75% (I think), but
because their system is competitive, I would not be admitted to the
school. Just for spite I never did learn how to calculate square roots,
beyond guessing, which worked for small numbers, but not for high ones.
Today it's a piece of cake for computers. It was a choice that failed —
apparently, but in a positive way for my future. I later (much later)
discovered that Brooklyn Prep was a Catholic school run by Jesuits.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<em>Brooklyn Preparatory School, commonly referred to as Brooklyn
Prep, was a highly selective <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesuit">Jesuit</a> preparatory
school founded by the Society of Jesus in 1908. The school educated
generations of young men from throughout New York City and Long Island
until its closure in 1972. As a Jesuit institution, Brooklyn Prep was
noted for its religious values, classical roots (e.g. <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin">Latin</a> and Greek), and
dress code (ties and jackets) — all part of its goal of turning out
well-rounded, educated men ... But whether a student could solve
algebraic equations with unusual facility or consistently throw cross
body blocks that led to touchdowns, he submitted as a prepster to an
iron, relentless discipline ...</em>” (New York Times — 1972).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Obviously, it was not my cup of tea. Furthermore, if I had studied
there, I might well have become a fanatical Roman Catholic, perhaps even
a priest, a bishop, even a pope instead of the Argentine Jorge
Bergoglio, who calls himself Francisco. I wouldn't even have had to
change my name. Now, in case you think that I, as pope, would redeem a
dying medieval institution by allowing women to become priests, kicking
out sexually abusive priests, throwing the myth of celibacy overboard,
etc., you might be disappointed, given that I could have been
successfully brainwashed by the Jesuits of Brooklyn Prep and kept things
as they still are, or worse. Oh, the gods of Jesuitism don't give up so
easily. They tried again at university level.</p>
<p><strong>The University of Vermont</strong></p>
<p>Why I went to the University of Vermont, of all places, is hard to
explain, even to myself. My friend Jerry (his real name), a year or two
older than me, who went there and told me how great it was and that he
would get me into the best national fraternity, was certainly an
influence, for I would never even have heard of it otherwise. Also, it
was a time when Brooklyn College, where I should have gone, was
determining admission by an examination. Perhaps I was still traumatized
by having failed the entrance examination for Brooklyn Prep. To make the
choice even more absurd, I applied for the college of agriculture. Why?
Because I had just seen a movie with Alan Ladd about farming and
combines and crooks who Alan, a courageous farmer, defeats and wins the
farmer's daughter. Or maybe I just wanted to get away from home, which
seems illogical though, because my parents were not at all domineering,
rather the opposite. They were non-academic types, having skipped high
school in favor of or need to work. If I wanted to go to the U. of
Vermont, of all places, why not?</p>
<p>I was thoroughly miserable in the so-called city of Burlington, the
frozen apple of Vermont, down the hill from the university. Compared to
the big apple core of the civilized world, New York, it was Deadsville,
dry as a bone. I turned eighteen in October and couldn't even get a
legal beer without buying a meal to go with it. I also realized how
deficient my high school education had been. As an agriculture major, I
naturally had a course in chemistry, something I had not the slightest
idea about, not having studied it in high school. (I am still abysmally
ignorant of chemistry, by the way.) My knowledge of mathematics was
sketchy, to say the least. About the only subject I liked and did well
in was English literature. What made the University of Vermont bearable
was football. I made the freshman team and would surely have gone on to
the varsity team in a year or two, except for a blow to the side of my
head. (We wore leather helmets those days.) It caused an infection in my
right earlobe, eventually a cyst. Prompt medical attention might have
taken care of it, but my guardian angel must have whispered into that
ear, “Let it Be.” It ended my football career and, indirectly and
eventually, my incipient academic career. I still have the cyst to
remind me.</p>
<p>Then there was the restaurant in Burlington where students liked to
hang out. I forget its name, so I'll call it Jane's. Jane was the
Saturday night waitress. Whenever I had enough pocket money I'd walk
downtown to Jane's, order a bottle of beer and a hamburger, the latter
enabling me to repeat the beer order ad infinitum. One Saturday night I
walked the waitress home, intending to seduce her. As it turned out she,
experienced, seduced me, the novice. A few days later I was visiting a
fellow football player in his dorm room. He was a bruising tackle. Above
his bed, as though it were a painting, a real waitress apron was pinned.
Under it the beast had written, in black crayon, “manhole cover.” I was
shocked, embarrassed, angry. I left the room as soon as possible, and
never returned. If I remember correctly, I didn't return to Jane's
either.</p>
<p>In another place, a diner, I met Bill Este one night. He was a few
years older than me, getting educated on his veteran's benefits. We got
talking over hamburgers and beer about Dostoevsky, especially <em>The
Brothers Karamazov</em>. Bill was surprised not only that I had heard of
it, but that I had actually <em>read</em> it. I read a lot, thanks to
the New York Public Library having a branch in Brooklyn where we lived.
That branch wasn't very big, and it didn't have many books, but if you
wanted something, they'd get it for you in a week from the central
library on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan.</p>
<p>Bill and I thought ourselves to be intellectually superior, because
we were probably the only students in UVM who had read Dostoevsky — or
had even heard of him. Finally, after meeting a few times more with
conversation and beer, we agreed that the U. of Vermont was inferior to
our talents (despite my imminent failing in chemistry and mathematics).
Bill had a plan, a solution. He said he had only decided to enroll in
UVM because the skiing was said to be so good. Well, it was already
November, and it hadn't even snowed yet. And it was bitter cold. Bill
suggested that we abandon Vermont and transfer to Georgetown University
in Washington DC. He knew important people there, he claimed, and he
could get us both accepted. We could leave the next morning. He had a
Volkswagen Beetle, which I admired almost as much as I did him. He said
we could share driving and be there in a couple of days. In order to
understand why I agreed to this crazy plan, you must know that I had
consumed an inordinate quantity of beer and was, to be honest, drunk.
Bill said he'd call for me in the lobby of my dorm at eight o'clock the
next morning. “Be ready!” he ordered. The next morning, a Saturday, my
roommate, a Vermont hick, shook me awake. There's a guy outside looking
for you, he said.</p>
<p>“Let's go, Frankie,” Bill Este said. I remembered last night through
the haze of a hangover and looked at him numbly.</p>
<p>“You coming, or not?” he said, clearly angry. I thought about what
I'd tell my parents, that I just decided to take a trip to Washington DC
in a VW beetle with an older guy I barely knew. I made a choice. “Er ...
no, Bill, I changed my mind,” I mumbled weakly. He seemed to want to say
something, but just turned on his heel and left. I never saw him again.
It was a good choice. I found out later that Georgetown was and still is
a Jesuit university that supplies the government with many of its most
powerful politicians, as well as the Supreme Court.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The Jesuit order relied on the plantations and slave labor to
sustain the clergy and to help finance the construction and the
day-to-day operations of churches and schools, including Georgetown, the
nation’s first Catholic institution of higher learning.
</em>[Wikipedia]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I had escaped again by the skin of my teeth. Maybe it was the
proverbial last straw, in that it cut off an avenue of escape from the
cold, the hillbillies, chemistry, math and, worst blow of all, the end
of my football career. I went home by train on the Christmas break and
proved to my eighteen-year-old-self that there's no place like home. I
told my parents that I didn't want to go back to Vermont (good choice)
and they just shrugged. My dad asked about all my stuff that was still
up there and I said I'd just have to go back and get it. “Let's drive up
there and get it,” he said. “You can drive.” I had turned eighteen in
October, so the first thing I had done on arriving in Brooklyn was
applying for and obtaining my driver's license — thanks to my dad, who
had taught me how to drive.So, we drove up to Burlington in his Hudson
Hornet. (That was before General Motors and Ford bought or forced out
all the smaller competition.) I went right to my room in the dorm and
told my roommate — a hick farmer, but a nice guy — that I was leaving
for good and to please tell whomever it may concern that I'm gone. He
stared at me with bulging eyes and open mouth while watching me pack.
Finally, he asked if I wanted help, which I did, so he carried one of my
two suitcases down to the car. We shook hands (boys didn't embrace those
days) and that was it.</p>
