<h3>A New Pax Romana</h3>

<main>
<p class="intro">The Roman poet Juvenal coined the phrase “<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bread_and_circuses">bread and
circuses</a>” nearly 2,000 years ago for the extravagant entertainment
the Roman Empire used to distract attention from imperial policies that
caused widespread discontent. Imagine the lavish banquets, gladiatorial
bouts, use and abuse of young men and women for the pleasure of the
rich, and so much more that characterized the later years of that
empire. And none of it seems that far off from the situation we, in
these increasingly dis-United States, find ourselves in today.</p>
<p>Although the Roman Empire described itself as being in favor of life
and peace, the various Caesars and their enablers regularly dealt death
and destruction in their wake. They spread the <a
href="https://www.pbs.org/empires/romans/empire/frontiers.html"><em>Pax
Romana</em></a> (the Roman Peace), including a taxation system that left
the poor in debt servitude, a military that caused terror and violence
across the then-known world, and a ruling authority that pitted whole
communities against each other, while legislating who could associate
with whom (passing <a
href="https://www.pbs.org/empires/romans/empire/weddings.html">marriage
laws</a>, for instance, that banned gay, inter-racial, or even
cross-class marriages). The emperor in power in Jesus’s time, Caesar
Augustus, was known for ushering in a Golden Age of Moral Values that
went hand in hand with that <em>Pax Romana</em>, and it meant war and
death, especially for the poor.</p>
<p>Fast forward millennia and that world bears a strange resemblance to
the media distractions, violence, and regressive policies that MAGA and
other extremists are pushing forward in our times. Whether it’s Donald
Trump’s assertion that “I alone <a
href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/07/trump-rnc-speech-alone-fix-it/492557/">can

nationalism</a>. In doing so, its leaders are perfecting a <a
href="https://newlinesmag.com/argument/j-d-vance-and-the-myth-of-white-exceptionalism/">disdain</a>
for the excluded, exploited, and rejected that hurts the poor first and
worst, but impacts all of society.</p>

<p>And now, after decades of neoliberal plunder and the coronation of an
avowed Christian nationalist — Speaker of the House <a
href="https://religionnews.com/2023/11/02/mike-johnsons-reading-of-scripture-misses-what-it-really-means-to-be-a-christian-nation/">Mike
Johnson</a> — to the third most powerful position in the government, the
Christian Right and its wealthy patrons have their eyes set on an even
more ambitious power-grab: Project 2025. Articulated through the <a
href="https://www.heritage.org/conservatism/commentary/project-2025">Heritage
Foundation’s</a> 2025 Presidential Transition Project, it’s a sprawling
plan to maximize presidential power with hundreds of newly trained and
deployed political operatives during Donald Trump’s next presidency. It
was seen in full display recently at the Republican National Convention
and made all the more likely by the recent assassination attempt against
him with (yes!) an AR-15! The nearly 900-page document outlines a plan
to ramp up U.S. military might, slash social welfare programs, and
prioritize “traditional marriage.” A reflection of the Republican Party
today, including several Christian nationalist organizations and
billionaire funders listed among its 100 institutional sponsors, Project
2025 is a roadmap for what could be thought of as a new <em>Pax
Romana</em>.</p>
<p><strong>The Formal Project 2025 Takeover</strong></p>
<p>As Project 2025’s <a href="https://www.project2025.org/">official
website</a> explains (and doesn’t this sound like it could come directly
from the mouth of vice-presidential nominee J.D. Vance?): “It is not
enough for conservatives to win elections. If we are going to rescue the
country from the grip of the radical Left, we need a governing agenda
and the right people in place, ready to carry this agenda out on Day One
of the next conservative Administration.” Although its authors
unabashedly deploy the language of conservative populism — decrying
wokeness and “cultural Marxists” — the plan is chiefly concerned with
how to put ever greater control of both people and resources in the
hands of a small minority of mostly white, mostly male, wealthy
Christians.</p>
<p>The wholesale capture of the state is the ultimate goal of its
Christian nationalist architects. Project 2025 simply clarifies just how
they plan to implement their drive for power. Each of its sections —
from “taking the reins of government” by centralizing executive
authority in the office of the President to securing “the common
defense” by expanding every branch of the military — is worth
reviewing.</p>
<p>The longest section focuses on “general welfare” and it should be no
surprise that the Departments of Agriculture, Health and Human Services,
and Housing and Urban Development are subject to significant cutbacks,
including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Imposing yet stricter eligibility standards, work requirements, and
asset tests to constrain access to Medicaid, even though <a
href="https://www.kff.org/report-section/medicaid-enrollment-and-unwinding-tracker-overview/#:~:text=At%20least%2023%2C785%2C000%20Medicaid%20enrollees,and%20the%20District%20of%20Columbia.">more
than 23 million Americans</a> have been unenrolled from that program
since 2023;</li>
<li>Revisiting how the “Thrifty Food Plan” is formulated to minimize
food-stamp allocations, while imposing onerous work requirements on the
Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP), even though <a
href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/food-assistance/most-working-age-snap-participants-work-but-often-in-unstable-jobs">most
of its recipients work</a> and/or are in households with children,
elderly people, or people with disabilities;</li>
<li>Ending universal free school meals by removing the “community
eligibility provision,” which allows school districts with high poverty
rates to provide free breakfast and lunch programs to all children in
need;</li>
<li>Eliminating <a
href="https://eclkc.ohs.acf.hhs.gov/data-ongoing-monitoring/article/head-start-program-facts-fiscal-year-2022">Head
Start</a>, which has served 39 million children and families since 1965
and currently serves more than 800,000 poor families with young
children, while shuttering the Department of Education;</li>
<li>Ending “<a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/20/us/politics/federal-policy-on-homelessness-becomes-new-target-of-the-right.html">Housing
First</a>” programs and prohibiting non-citizens, including mixed-status
families, from living in low-income public housing; and</li>
<li>Imposing a “life agenda” and a “family agenda” that will restrict
access to abortion and reproductive rights, and otherwise curtail LGBTQ+
rights.</li>
</ul>
<p>Such proposals would undoubtedly be deeply unpopular. In fact, as
people <a
href="https://navigatorresearch.org/a-guide-for-progressives-on-how-to-brand-project-2025/">learn
more</a> about Project 2025, opposition is growing, even across party
lines. <a
href="https://navigatorresearch.org/vast-majorities-of-americans-intensely-support-increasing-funding-for-programs/">Most
Americans</a> want a government that would provide for the down-and-out,
who are a growing segment of the population and the electorate, as well
as one that supports <a
href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/506759/broader-support-abortion-rights-continues-post-dobbs.aspx">abortion
rights</a>, <a
href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/403052/eight-americans-favor-early-voting-photo-laws.aspx">voting
rights</a>, and the <a
href="https://www.thefire.org/news/poll-69-americans-believe-country-wrong-track-free-speech">freedom
of expression</a>. At least <a
href="https://otherwords.org/a-wake-up-call-on-poverty/">40%</a> of us —
135-140 million people — are either poor or one emergency away from
economic ruin, including 80 million eligible voters. Project 2025’s
social welfare cuts would, in fact, push significant numbers of people
across the poverty line into financial ruin.</p>
<p>Even Donald Trump has tried to distance himself from Project 2025 as
attention has moved toward its distinctly (di)visionary agenda. However,
<a
href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/11/politics/trump-allies-project-2025/index.html">more
than half</a> of the project’s listed authors, editors, or contributors
were once part of his administration — and no one doubts that his
vice-presidential nominee is 100% pro-Project 2025!</p>
<p><strong>The Informal Takeover Already Underway</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps scarier than either Trump’s or Vance’s connection to this
regressive plan, however, is the fact that, despite popular distaste for
such policies, it may not take a second Trump presidency to implement
significant parts of Project 2025. In this sense, it reflects the
ancient world of the <em>Pax Romana</em>. Rather than being dependent on
particular emperors, its “peace” was a political and ideological program
that punished the poor and marginalized so many, while keeping all its
subjects in line.</p>
<p>From its recent rulings, it’s clear that the Supreme Court is
hastening Project 2025’s agenda judicially, both in terms of specific
future policies and the executive power grab at the heart of that
mandate (and now of that <a
href="https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/supreme-court-grants-trump-broad-immunity-for-official-acts-placing-presidents-above-the-law">court’s
rulings</a>). In June, for instance, it ruled in favor of the city of <a
href="https://www.propublica.org/article/us-supreme-court-grants-pass-homelessness#:~:text=In%20its%206%2D3%20decision,against%20cruel%20and%20unusual%20punishment.">Grants
Pass, Oregon</a>, which enacted a law to fine, jail, and ultimately
expel its unhoused residents. That precedent will only exacerbate the
already <a
href="https://homelesslaw.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/US-Joint-SR-Report.pdf">hostile
terrain</a> confronting unhoused people, seeding firm ground to 2025’s
plan to eliminate even more housing projects.</p>
<p>Worse yet, as the <em>Nation</em>’s Elie Mystal recently <a
href="https://www.thenation.com/article/society/supreme-court-term-consequences/">made
clear</a>, in just a few weeks of rulings, the court “legalized bribery
of public officials, declared the president of the United States
absolutely immune from criminal prosecution for ‘official acts,’ and
made the power to issue regulations subject to the court’s unelected
approval.” As he warns, “There’s no legislative fix for the problems the
court has created… [and] they will continue to do all the things
Republicans want that nobody elected them to do.”</p>
<p>In addition, in the legislative arena, Congressional debates around
<a
href="https://thehill.com/business/4689837-a-fight-over-snap-funding-could-derail-the-farm-bill/">the
Farm Bill</a> echo Project 2025’s plan to cut food assistance by
limiting updates to the Thrifty Food Plan, the current formula that
determines SNAP allocations. For example, at the state level, a <a
href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/house-republicans-food-stamps-debt-ceiling-rcna81971">Republican
supermajority</a> in Kansas voted last year to override the governor’s
veto and enact work requirements for older recipients of SNAP
benefits.</p>
<p>Overall, various Project 2025 priorities are already being
implemented at the state and local level, with reproductive rights, <a
href="https://www.aclu.org/legislative-attacks-on-lgbtq-rights-2024">LGBTQ+
rights</a>, public education, social welfare programs, and unhoused
people under serious threat in Republican-run states across the country.
Since the Supreme Court decision in 2022 to <a
href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/19-1392_6j37.pdf">overturn
<em>Roe v. Wade</em></a>, 21 states have enacted <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/abortion-laws-roe-v-wade.html">full
or partial bans</a> on abortion. Meanwhile, far-right groups like <a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/06/moms-for-liberty-long-history-rightwing-activism">Moms
of Liberty</a> are seeking to capture local school boards as part of a
“war on wokeness.”</p>
<p>There is also a multi-state strategy underway to preempt
community-led efforts to implement guaranteed income programs. At least
<a
href="https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/banning-guaranteed-income-programs-undermines-american-values">10
states</a> have challenged <a
href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/60ae8e339f75051fd95f792e/t/65d3f264d2a6c70038ca259d/1708388968295/LRP+MGI+national+Survey+Memo+1.5.2024+(2).pdf">basic
income programs</a> with legislative bans, funding restrictions,
constitutional challenges, and court injunctions, while <a
href="https://www.npr.org/2024/05/03/1248663386/basic-income-ban-poverty-cash-aid-states">four
Republican-led states</a> — Arkansas, Idaho, Iowa, and South Dakota —
have already completely prohibited such programs.  </p>
<p>And in lockstep with Project 2025’s call for military expansion,
Mississippi Senator <a
href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/williamhartung/2024/05/30/wickers-pentagon-spending-plan-doubles-down-on-a-failedl-strategy/?sh=594d52535805">Roger
Wicker</a> recently released <a
href="https://www.wicker.senate.gov/services/files/BC957888-0A93-432F-A49E-6202768A9CE0">a
report</a> proposing that $55 billion be added to the Pentagon’s already
humongous budget in fiscal year 2025 while raising military spending by
hundreds of billions of dollars in the next five to seven years. The
report, “Peace Through Strength,” revives the false idea that spending
ever more on war preparations makes us safer. Not only is Wicker
distorting <a
href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/williamhartung/2024/05/30/wickers-pentagon-spending-plan-doubles-down-on-a-failedl-strategy/">Cold
War history</a>, but his prescriptions ignore our experience of the past
20 years of military buildup and the disastrous Global War on Terror.
According to <a href="https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/">the Costs of
War Project</a> and the <a
href="https://www.nationalpriorities.org/">National Priorities
Project</a>, this country’s post-9/11 wars have cost at least $8
trillion, taken millions of lives, and displaced tens of millions of
people globally, while precipitating <a
href="https://www.nationalpriorities.org/analysis/2020/no-warming-no-war/">climate
chaos</a> through their polluting emissions. If implemented, Wicker’s
plan would only increase the risk of yet more destabilizing conflicts,
offering a modern <em>Pax Romana</em> promise for yet more war and
death.</p>
<p><strong>Peace, Peace, When There Is No Peace</strong></p>
<p>While extremist Republican politicians and appointees are leading the
way on Project 2025, both major parties align around building up the war
economy. Indeed, bipartisan support for military aid to Israel is
contributing to what the United Nations has labeled a genocide in
Gaza.</p>
<p>Nor is this new. Every year, the Pentagon budget invariably passes
with widespread bipartisan support, even if a few representatives vote
otherwise. Since the 9/11 attacks, in fact, <a
href="https://www.nationalpriorities.org/pressroom/articles/2021/09/03/us-spent-21-trillion-on-militarization-since-911/#:~:text=Their%20key%20finding%20—%20that%20the,is%20every%20bit%20as%20revealing.">$21
trillion</a> has been funneled into war, surveillance, policing, border
control, and incarceration. In Fiscal Year 2023, nearly <a
href="https://www.nationalpriorities.org/analysis/2023/warfare-state-how-funding-militarism-compromises-our-welfare/">two-thirds</a>
of the federal discretionary budget funded the military-industrial
complex and militarized spending. This year, a Democratic amendment to
the National Defense Authorization Act will <a
href="https://responsiblestatecraft.org/selective-service-draft/">automatically
register</a> every male citizen and resident aged 18-26 in the selective
service database. This measure has only passed in the House of
Representatives, but it suggests interest across party lines in
increasing the number of individuals who could someday be called up for
military service. While this is not (yet) a draft, it hints at one — and
it was introduced by Pennsylvania’s Democratic Congresswoman Chrissy
Houlahan.</p>
<p>The state and local counterpart to militarism is support for the
police. Both <a
href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2021-06-19/amid-reform-movement-some-gop-states-give-police-more-power">Republican</a>
and <a
href="https://www.axios.com/2024/03/12/crime-democrat-states-republican">Democratic</a>
lawmakers seem intent on adopting “<a
href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/03/07/liberal-cities-crime-policies-00145532">tough
on crime</a>” legislation, including hiring more police officers,
deploying the National Guard more widely, expanding surveillance
measures, and recriminalizing drug possession. Of course, the <a
href="https://www.aclu.org/news/criminal-law-reform/federal-militarization-of-law-enforcement-must-end">1033
program</a> allows local police forces to be armed and <a
href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/mp-graphics/201412-dod/embed.html">trained
by the U.S. military</a>.</p>
<p>This remarkably bipartisan consensus for a war economy shouldn’t just
be considered another “issue,” but an approach to governance that relies
on force and violence, rather than consent, to establish social control.
And as noted above, the nation may have automatic registration for the
selective service system before we have automatic registration to vote.
After all, the same Congress that supports ever more resources for war
has failed to stop voter suppression, expand voting rights, or
adequately protect our democracy.</p>
<p><strong>Jobs and Homes, Not Death in the Streets</strong></p>
<p>The greatest violence of the <em>Pax Romana</em> was always borne by
the poor, who were often ripped from their families, enslaved in
back-breaking labor, and dispossessed of their land and resources. To
maintain its authoritarian rule over millions of people, the Roman
Empire relied on its military might and the fear inspired by its brutal
army. And yet it was from the ranks of the poor that Jesus and his
disciples led a non-violent revolution for peace.</p>
<p>Today, tens of millions of poor people in this country are on the
front lines of our failing democracy and increasingly militarized
society. They are the true canaries in the coal mine, already living
through the violence of a society that has prioritized war and profits
over addressing the pain and toll of low-wage jobs, crushing debt
burdens, polluted water and land, and lives cut short by poverty, the
police, and the denial of basic human rights. They can undoubtedly also
foresee the drive toward an ever-deeper warfare state and the possible
fallout from Project 2025 if Donald Trump and J.D. Vance win this
year.</p>
<p>Forged in the crucible of violence, the criminalized and impoverished
still call out for a true peace.</p>
<p>On June 29th, Reverend Savina Martin, a military veteran and formerly
homeless mother, took to the stage of the Poor People’s Campaign’s <a
href="https://www.poorpeoplescampaign.org/mm2024/">Mass Assembly</a> in
Washington, D.C., and shared these thoughts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I am a US Army veteran and I was impacted by homelessness many years
ago. Today, thousands of homeless veterans are fighting for [their]
benefits, housing… navigating a complex system while sick and suffering,
trying to survive the war waged against the poor. Yesterday, the US
Supreme Court decision in <em>Grants Pass v. Johnson</em> permits cities
to criminalize homelessness by enforcing bans on sleeping outside when
no shelter is available. How can sleeping while homeless be against the
law? If you sleep, you get arrested?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“This system depends on us to fight their wars, but we can’t depend
on [our government] to guarantee housing or healthcare? Instead, [our
government] allocates $1.1 trillion to war, weapons, and a system that
criminalizes the poor, leading to mass incarceration, deportations, and
detentions. We want jobs and homes, not death in the streets.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Savina was speaking of the war on the poor, the power of the
military-industrial complex, and an extremist agenda that will connect
her in unsettling ways with 140 million poor and low-income people in
this country — and billions more around the world. As in other moments
of history, the struggle of the poor for life and dignity in a world
that denies them both is a struggle for the best that we can be as a
society. In their leadership lies the hope for us all — not in Project
2025, a future Trump administration, or the all-too-devastating version
of a <em>Pax Americana</em> that would go with it, but in the peace (and
justice) that Savina and so many others are demanding, and will continue
to push for, until it is ours. </p>
