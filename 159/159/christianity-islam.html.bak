<p style="font-style: italic;">19 March 1924, Dornach, GA 353 (questions by the workers building the
First Goetheanum)</p>
<p class="intro">The question which has been asked, Gentlemen, is wide-ranging, and
we’ll need a few sessions to discuss it.</p>
<p>Today I’d like to go into more detail about the later part of the
time when Christianity spread. If we look at Christianity today, it has
three forms. These have to be considered if we want to find the right
way of tracing what really happened because of the Mystery of Golgotha,
considering the ideas that are held today.</p>
<p>Let us first of all consider Europe. As I have shown the other day,
we have Asia over there, with Europe really a kind of peninsula of Asia.
As you know, it looks like this [sketching on the blackboard]. This
would be Norway, then Russia over here; this takes us to the north coast
of Germany; and here is Denmark. Over here we come to Holland, France,
and this would be Spain. Here we have Italy, Greece, the Black Sea, and
we then come to Asia. Africa would be down below.</p>
<p>It is difficult to speak about the spread of Christianity in the
present day and age because conditions are unusual in this respect. But
if we consider Christianity as it was before the World War in these
parts of Russia we are able to say: This eastern Christianity still had
more of the original religious character that came from Asia. I have
spoken of the different forms it took with the Egyptians, Indians and
Assyrians. Much of the ritual, the offering ritual, for instance, that
was well understood in Asia has flowed into the Christianity in these
eastern parts. When you get to know the religious practices of these
parts you get a direct feeling that the ritual is much more important
than the teaching. The teaching seeks to express something that belongs
to the world of the spirit in human words, or at least as much as human
feeling can grasp of that world. It always seeks to address the human
intellect. The ritual on the other hand is much more conservative, and
religion is conservative by nature in areas where ritual predominates.
We may thus say that the eastern religion is conservative by nature,
with ritual considered more important in bringing religion, religious
life, to human hearts than in areas that lie more to the west.</p>
<p>The second stream in Christianity came from Rome, spreading to the
north, and was then strongly influenced by missionaries coming from
Ireland. This southern and central European Christianity under the
influence of Rome has kept its ritual, but it also put more emphasis on
teaching than the eastern religion. People are thus much less aware of
the significance of ritual than of the preaching, the teaching. There
has been much more dispute about the teaching within the Roman Catholic
Church than in the Eastern Church.</p>
<p>There was also another influence. Christianity arose at the beginning
of our era, with Islam arising five or six centuries later. I drew
Arabia for you the other day. If I draw Asia Minor again, we come to
Arabia down here, with India over there. This would be Africa, with
Egypt here. Here in Arabia, Islam came through Mohamed. Islam spread
with great rapidity in the second half of the first Christian
millennium, from Asia initially towards Syria and here to the Black Sea,
then through Africa over to Italy, Spain and the west of Europe. The
special characteristic of the Islamic religion is that it combines a
fantasy element with one that is sober and rational. The main principle
of Islam, which spread so rapidly in the seventh to ninth centuries, is
that there is only one God, the one proclaimed by Mohamed.</p>
<p>We need to understand what it means in world history that Mohamed
insisted on this principle of one God. Why did he stress this point so
much? He knew the Christian faith; this does has not have three gods,
but it has three divine figures. People are no longer conscious of this.
They do not realize that Christianity from its very beginning had not
three gods, but three divine figures—Father, Son and Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>What does this mean? You see, the original Latin meaning of ‘person’
was ‘figure, mask, the character represented’. And in the original
Christian faith people did not speak of three gods but three figures
through whom the one God was revealed. They had a feeling for the true
nature of those three figures.</p>
<p>Let us consider what is the real situation with those three figures.
Today, we have a science that is distinct from religion, and so we are
no longer able to understand this situation. Scholarship has become
quite independent of religion, and people do not think of religious life
when they speak of scholarship or science. It was different in earlier
times, including early Christian times. All scholarship was studied
together with religion. They did not have separate priests and scholars,
for their priests were also scholars. This was above all the case in the
late mysteries I have described to you.</p>
<p>In those mysteries the human being was seen to be part of nature,
born from the womb as a physical human being with the aid of natural
forces. This, they felt and thought, was where forces of nature were
active in the human being. If I consider the way a physical human being
comes into existence, I am looking at forces that can also be seen in a
growing tree, in evaporating water and in falling rain. These are forces
of nature. But in earlier times people perceived spiritual forces behind
those forces of nature. Spiritual forces are at work throughout nature.
They are at work when a crystal develops in the mountain, and the stone
grows, when a plant appears in spring, when water evaporates, clouds
form and rain falls. The same spiritual forces are active in the human
embryo developing in the womb. They are active in the blood coursing
through the veins and the breath coming in and going out. The ancients
saw everything in nature as spiritual and everything in the human being
as the Father Principle, calling it the ‘Father’ because nature study
was also religion at the time.</p>
<p>They would say to themselves: ‘Someone who has achieved the highest
level of enlightenment in the mysteries is an image of this Father
Spirit; he knows about everything that exists in nature.’ This was the
7<sup>th</sup> stage in the mysteries.</p>
<p>The next level was that of the Sun Spirit, as I have told you. What
did people mean by this Sun Spirit who was later called the Son? As I
said, the Christ referred to himself as Sun Spirit. People would say:
‘Human beings are born through forces of nature, the same forces that
make plants grow, and so on; but they develop during their lives on
earth. In the state in which they are born through the forces of nature,
we can no more call them good or evil than we can a plant.’ You would
never dream of calling a deadly nightshade-plant evil because it is
poisonous to humans. You would say it cannot help it. A deadly
nightshade-plant does not have a will living in it, whereas a human
being does. And when a child is born we cannot say that it may be good
or evil because of the forces of nature. It becomes good or evil because
the human will gradually develops. In contrast to the forces active in
nature, therefore, people would call the principle active in the human
will—a principle that may be good or evil—the Son of God or the Sun
Spirit. Someone able to reach the 6<sup>th</sup> stage in the mysteries
would merely be a representative of this. All the individual
representatives of the 6<sup>th</sup> level were representatives of the
God principle on earth. And people knew the sun to be not merely a body
of gas; the sun was giving out not only light and warmth, but also the
powers that developed the will.</p>
<p>Thus not only light and warmth came from the sun but also the sun
spirit. The Son-God was also the Sun-Spirit. People would say,
therefore, that the Father- God was to be found everywhere in the
natural world, and the Son-God wherever human beings developed an
independent will. People then thought of something very strange. They
would ask: Does it make a human being worth more or worth less when he
develops an independent will? They were still asking themselves this
question at the time when Christianity came.</p>
<p>Gentlemen, think of any natural product, even going as high as an
animal. Now if a cow has grown old, you may say people pay less for it
than when it was young. It would then be worth less than it was when it
was young. This is true, but it is not the point, for we realize that
the cow has become worth less not because of something active within it
as will, but because of a natural event. A human being who does bad
things, however, developing his will in a way that is not good, will be
worth less than he is by nature. Human beings therefore need a third
deity who can guide them to make their will good again, really good, to
hallow a will that has grown unsound. And that was the third form of the
divine, the Holy Spirit, who was always represented as the
5<sup>th</sup> level of initiation in the mysteries, and given the name
of the nation.</p>
<p>The people of past times thus said the divine principle came to
revelation in three ways. You see, they might have said: there is a god
of nature, a god of will, and a god of spirit, where the will is
hallowed again and made spiritual. They actually did say this, for the
old words meant just that. ‘Father’ was something connected with the
origins of the physical world, a natural principle. In the languages we
have now, the significance of these words has been lost. But those
people of old would add something when they said there is a god of
nature, the Father, a god of will, the Son, and a god of spirit, the
Holy Spirit who heals all that has grown sick because of the will. They
would add: ‘These three are one.’ Their most important statement, their
greatest conviction therefore was this: ‘The divine has three forms, but
these three are one.’</p>
<p>Something else they would say was: ‘If you look at a human being, you
see a big difference from the natural world. If you look at a stone,
what is active in it? The Father. If you look at a plant, what is active
in it? The Father-God. If you look at the human being as a physical
human being, what is active in it? The Father-God. However, if you look
at the human being as soul, in his will, what is active in this? The
Son-God. And if you consider the future of humanity, how it shall be one
day when all shall be healthy again in the will—that is where the
Spirit-God is at work.’ All three gods, they would say, are active in
the human being. There are three gods or divine forms; but they are one,
and they also work as one in the human being.</p>
<p>That was the original Christian belief. Going back to early Christian
times we would find people still saying they were convinced of this.
They would say: ‘Yes, this healing spirit that brings health must act in
two ways. In the first place it must act on the physical aspect that
comes from the Father, because nature can fall into sickness. And it
must act on the principle that comes from the Son, because the will,
too, must be healed.’ What they said, therefore, was that the Holy
Spirit had to act in such a way that it arose from both the Father and
the Son. That was the original belief held by Christians.</p>
<p>Mohamed may be said to have grown anxious, as it were. He saw that
ancient paganism with its many gods would go into a decline and ruin
humanity. He saw Christianity evolve and said to himself that this, too,
held the danger of a multiplicity of gods, that is, three gods. He did
not realize that these were three forms of the divine and he therefore
went into opposition, emphatically saying that there was only one God,
proclaimed by Mohamed and that everything else said about the gods was
wrong.</p>
<p>This dogma was proclaimed far and wide with great fanaticism, and as
a result the thought of three divine figures was completely absent from
Islam. They would speak only of the one God whom they felt to be the
father of all that exists. The thinking in Islam therefore also was that
just as a stone does not grow to be what it is out of its own free will,
as a plant does not have its own will but is given yellow or red flowers
by nature, so everything in the human being, too, would grow out of
nature. This gave rise to a rigid notion of destiny in Islam—we call it
fatalism—that human beings have to submit to a wholly unconditional,
predetermined fate. If they are happy, this is so because the Father God
wills it; if they are unhappy, it is so because the Father God wills it.
They have to submit to their fate. That was the religious aspect of
Islam.</p>
<p>Mohamed saw everything in the human being to be the same as it is in
nature, and this made it much easier for him to accept the whole of the
ancient art and the whole of the old way of life than Christianity.
Christianity was above all concerned with the healing of the human will.
Islam was not concerned with this, seeing no reason for doing so. If it
is determined that a person is to be evil, then that is the will of the
Father God. Christians would say: “The pagans of old were mainly
concerned with the Father God; we must set up the Son God against this.’
Mohamed, and above all his followers, did not say this. They said: ‘The
pagans of old may have had many gods, but they also venerated nature,
and the one God is at work in this.’ Much of the old knowledge and art
has therefore been preserved in Islam. In the ninth century, for
example, Charlemagne, king of the Franks and later emperor, one of the
greatest medieval rulers in Europe and a well-known historical figure,
found it a great effort to learn his letters and was not yet able to
write. His achievements in the arts and sciences were very small
compared to those made under Harun al-Rashid who was Caliph of Baghdad
at the time. Much of the art and science from earlier pagan times had
been preserved there; it came to Europe later, from the south, through
Spain.</p>
<p>Christianity spread from Rome. We might say that Islam, coming from
Asia, skirted around it. Great battles were also fought between them.
And the followers of Islam did something unusual. You know that if there
is an army somewhere, much can be gained strategically by secretly
moving around it and attacking from the other side. This is really what
happened with Islam and Christianity. The followers of Islam skirted
around Christian areas in the south and then attacked from the left
flank.</p>
<p>But you see, if this had not happened, if all that had happened would
have been the spread of Christianity, we would have no science today.
The religious element of Islam was rejected, fought against. But the
element that did not involve religious strife but preserved earlier
knowledge and took it further did come to Europe with Islam. There the
Europeans learned the things that have become part of modern science.
Two things therefore live in the European soul today: we have the
religion that has come with Christianity and the science that has come
with Islam, though in a roundabout way. And our Christianity has only
been able to develop the way it did because knowledge, science, has been
influenced by Islam.</p>
<p>This aroused an ever greater desire in the European west to defend
Christianity. Where ritual prevails you have less need to defend
religion, for ritual has a great influence on people. Here the tendency
coming from Rome was to make ritual less important, though it was
retained. Dogma predominated and had to be defended all the time against
the Muslim onslaught. The whole of the Middle Ages really passed over
these struggles which were fought in the field initially and then in
human minds. Everything we call European culture or civilization has
gradually evolved in the second half of the Middle Ages. What did evolve
there?</p>
<p>Over in the east, all the way to Russia and indeed Greece, Christians
could do no other but remain true to the old traditions. This meant to
perform outer acts, even if they were purely symbolic by nature. One had
to take account of the natural world. And one was much more inclined to
put the emphasis on the Father-God rather than the Son-God. Just as the
destiny principle that came from Mohamed was to submit entirely to what
the Father-God ordained, so this Father-God also emerged more strongly
in eastern Christianity than the Son, the way the tenor of belief went.
The strange shift in thinking that occurred was that the people in the
east did hold firmly to the Christ, but they transferred the attributes
of the Father-God to the Christ. Something of a cloud was cast over it
all; people would speak less of the Son-God; they would become
Christians, recognizing Christ to be their God, but they saw in him the
attributes of the Father-God. The view that evolved in this eastern
religion was really: Christ, our Father. This notion of Christ, our
Father, is to be found in the whole of the eastern religion.</p>
<p>In Europe people wanted to fight Islam, the idea of only one God who
did not have three forms, and so the concept of the three divine persons
took a deep hold. Well, as you know, you can fight for a time; people
may sit down together and be in continual dispute; one says one thing to
another person, who then says something else. So they dispute. But what
is generally the result? They finally separate, each going his own way.
The end of the dispute is that people agree to differ. It is extremely
rare for agreement to be reached, especially if the dispute is of some
magnitude. You’ll remember how first there was a socialist party that
had many disputes. There was a right wing and a left wing. In due course
the wings became separate party organizations. And that is how it was
with the spread of Christianity. Over in Asia in the East people thought
more of the Father-God, though they held to the Christ; in Europe they
made more of a distinction between the Father and the Son. They disputed
and fought over the issue until the ninth or tenth century. Then came
the great split. The eastern Church, called the Orthodox Church today
because it has continued with the old, original things, separated from
the western Church, the Roman Catholic Church. That was the time when
the great division appeared between the eastern Church, eastern
Christianity, and western Christianity.</p>
<p>This continued for a time. In the eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth
centuries people got used to the idea of an eastern and a western
aspect. But then something happened that in some respects upset it all
again. It was the Crusades.</p>
<p>Mohamed had originally worked among the Arabs who were the first to
take up Islam. The Arab people had a strong nature religion and
therefore were prepared to understand the idea of the Father, and
recognize the Father-God. In the early days of Islam the idea developed
of a Father-God who worked through nature, including human nature.</p>
<p>Then, however, tribes came from the far regions of Asia. Their
descendants today are the Turks. They fought wars against the Arab
people. The strange thing about those Mongols, whose descendants are the
Turks, is that they did not really have a nature-god. Like the people of
early civilizations they did not have the eye for nature which the
Greeks later developed so strongly. The Turks came from their original
homes with no feeling for nature but a tremendous feeling for a
spiritual God, a God to be approached in thought only who could never be
seen with one’s eyes. This particular way of approaching the Godhead
became part of Islam. The Turks accepted the Muslim religion of the
people they conquered but changed it to fit in with their ideas. And
whilst Islam had accepted much that came from earlier times, both art
and science, the Turks really threw out anything that might be called
art or science and really became hostile to art and science. They were
the terror of the western peoples, a terror for all who had accepted
Christianity.</p>
<p>You see, the region where Christianity arose, in Palestine, with
Jerusalem, was particularly sacred to the Christians. Many made
pilgrimages there from all parts of the West, which called for great
sacrifices. Many people were extremely poor and it was hard for them to
get the means together for the journey to Palestine to visit the Holy
Sepulcher, as it is called. And they made the journey! When the Turks
came the journey became dangerous, for the Turks extended their rule to
Palestine and maltreated the Christian pilgrims. The Europeans then
wanted Jerusalem to be freed so that people might go there. They wanted
to set up their own European rule in Palestine and therefore undertook
those great campaigns called the Crusades. These did not achieve what
they were meant to achieve but they reflect the war, the battle, between
western Christianity and eastern Christianity on one hand and Turkish
Islam on the other. Christianity was to be saved in the face of a Muslim
religion grown Turkish.</p>
<p>Many people then went to Asia to fight. What did they find there? The
Crusades started in the twelfth century and continued for some
centuries, and so they were in the middle of the Middle Ages. What was
the first thing the people who went to Asia as Crusaders would see? They
saw that the Turks are fearsome enemies to face. But when a Crusader
looked around a bit on days when there was no fighting, he might find
some strange things. He might have met an old man who had withdrawn to
his poor hovel somewhere and did not concern himself with Turks,
Christians or Arabs but had shown remarkable faithfulness in continuing
the culture, the wisdom and religious knowledge of earlier pagan times.
The Turks had paid no regard to this. Official civilization had
eradicated it; but there were many such people. And so the Europeans got
to know much of the old wisdom that no longer existed in Christianity.
This they brought with them to Europe on their return.</p>
<p>Imagine how things were at the time. Earlier on Arabs had come to
Europe via Italy and Spain, bringing their art and a scientific thinking
that spread and has become our modern science. Now the ancient wisdom
from the East was brought back and the two became mixed. As a result,
something special developed in Europe.</p>
<p>You see, the Roman Church adopted the ritual, using it less, however,
than the eastern Church did. It adopted the ritual but also went
strongly into teaching. But in the old Church teaching, religious
instruction was connected with the person. It remained such until the
time of the Crusades. Instruction consisted in what was proclaimed from
the pulpit and approved by the Councils that were held. And apart from
this there was also the ‘New Testament’, as it was called, the Bible.
People who were not priests were, however, forbidden to read the Bible,
and this was strictly enforced. It was considered a terrible thing for
someone to want to read the Bible in those earlier times before the
Crusades. It was not permitted. The lay people, the faithful, therefore
had only what the priests taught, they did not have access to the
Bible.</p>
<p>The science brought by the Arabs and the ancient wisdom of the East
made many people feel: ‘This is something the priests who are giving
instruction do not know. There is a great deal more wisdom than is
taught by them.’ And a tendency, an intention arose to read the Bible
oneself and get to know the New Testament. Protestantism, the third kind
of Christianity, developed out of this, with Martin Luther as its
special representative, though the intention was there even before he
came.</p>
<p>Take the areas, for example, where Czechoslovakia, Bohemia and
Bavaria are today; take these areas along the Rhine, from Holland down
into Germany—I could mention other areas as well. Brotherhoods were
developing everywhere in those areas. Here, down the Rhine, the
Brotherhood of Communal Life developed, here, more to the east, the
Moravian Church or Renewed Church of the Brethren came into being. What
were their aims? The brethren would say: ‘The Christianity that has come
from Rome is not the true Christianity. The Christian faith is something
you have to find out of the inner life.’ Initially the aim was to find
the origins of Christianity in an inward way. Later they would also say
that one had to know the Gospels. Both aims came from the same
source.</p>
<p>You see, that was the great difference between Huss, who lived and
worked in today’s Czech region, and Luther. Huss was less concerned with
the Gospels; what mattered to him was that Christianity came inwardly
alive. Later this took more of an outward form in the study of the
Gospels. The Gospels were, however, written under very different
conditions of life. They spoke in images, and those images were no
longer understood in later times. Let me give you an example.</p>
<p>A Gospel story tells of the Christ healing the sick. At the time
nervous disorders were much more widespread in the areas where he taught
than diseases connected with particular organs. Nervous disorders can
often be cured by kind words, with the love one human being gives to
another. Most instances we are given of the sick being healed there are
of that kind. But then we read: ‘When the sun had set, the Christ
gathered people around him and healed them.’ People do not consider the
passage significant when they read it today; it seems to them that it
merely refers to the time of day. The question is, why is the time given
at this point? Because the writer wanted to say: ‘The powers a human
being develops when he seeks to heal others are greater when the sun is
not in the heavens above and its rays come through the earth than they
are when the sun is up above in the heavens.’ It is most significant
that it says there: ‘When the sun had set, Christ gathered people around
him and healed them.’ People no longer take note of this. It was meant
to say that the Christ used the natural powers that resided in human
beings when he healed them. The Gospels were thus translated in an age
when it was no longer possible to understand them. Essentially very
little of the Gospels is really understood.</p>
<p>It really was true of all these areas, both in eastern Christianity
and in western and Protestant Christianity, and I have spoken of this on
many other occasions. Something that had originally been well understood
continued by tradition but was then no longer understood. I would say
each of the three forms of Christianity had one main aspect. Eastern
Christianity had the Father-God, though he was called the Christ. The
Roman Catholic Church of the west had the Son-God, and looked up to the
Father as an old man with a long beard who would still appear in their
paintings, but they would not speak much of the Father-God. And
Protestant Christianity had the Spirit-God. They would discuss questions
such as ‘How do we free ourselves from sin? How can we be healed of sin?
How does man justify himself before God?’ and so on. Christianity
originally had one God represented in three figures. It fell apart into
three confessions. Each of them has a piece, a genuine piece, of
Christianity.</p>
<p>It will not be possible, however, to regain original Christianity by
putting the three pieces together. It has to be found again by people
finding the right powers in themselves, as I began to show the other
day. I wanted to mention this today so that you may see how hard it is
to come back to original Christianity. If you ask Christians in the
East: ‘Which is the true Christianity?’ they will say, ‘Everything that
relates to the Father,’ and they will call the Father ‘Christ’. If you
ask people in the Roman Catholic Church what is the essence of
Christianity, they will speak of everything connected with the
sinfulness of man, the evils of human nature, and that human beings must
be redeemed from their suffering, and so on. They will speak of
everything connected with the Son, the Christ. If you ask Protestant
Christians about the essential nature of Christianity they will say: ‘It
all has to do with the principle of gaining health in the will, letting
the will be healed, and justification before God.’ They speak of the
Holy Spirit, calling him the Christ.</p>
<p>This is how everything we have today has come about. People did not
think: ‘We must now bring together the three different aspects of
Christianity.’ They said: ‘We don’t understand any of this any more!’
This has created the mood we have today, and the need to find
Christianity again.</p>
<p>Next Saturday I would like to talk to you about the Mystery of
Golgotha in this way. I hope it will then be possible to finish
answering this particular question.</p>
