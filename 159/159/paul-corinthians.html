        If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love,<br />
        I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.<br />
        And if I have prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all<br />
        knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains,<br />
        but have not love, I am nothing.<br />
        If I give away all I have, and if I deliver up my body to be burned,<br />
        but have not love, I gain nothing.<br />
        Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast;<br />
        it is not arrogant or rude.<br />
        It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful;<br />
        it does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth.<br />
        Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things,<br />
        endures all things. Love never ends.<br />
        As for prophecies, they will pass way.<br />
        For we know partially and we prophesy partially,<br />
        but when the perfect comes, the partial will pass away.<br />
        When I was a child, I used to talk as a child, think as a child,<br />
        reason as a child; when I became a man, I put aside childish things.<br />
        At present we see indistinctly, as in a mirror, but then face to
        face.<br />
        At present I know partially; then I shall know fully, as I am fully<br />
        known.<br />
        So now faith, hope, and love remain, these three;<br />
        but the greatest of these is love.

            My sister Faith was first to go,<br />
            Her blood was staunched and ceased to flow.<br />
            Never was she the worldly type,<br />
            And won't return till time is ripe.<br />
            My other sister's name is Hope;<br />
            Never was she one to mope.<br />
            Her eyes, once fawn's, now sadly droop,<br />
            She walks with an ancient's wary stoop.<br />
            Hard it'll be to linger on<br />
            When blissful sister Hope is gone.<br />
            Retreat I'll then, I'll take cover,<br />
            With my ever-constant lover.<br />
            A generation will rise and when<br />
            My sisters will be born again,<br />
            They'll care too much not to persist,<br />
            Hope's trembling lips insist.<br />
            We three will roam the world's wide web<br />
            Repeating what the Savior said,<br />
            We'll cast away our mourning clothes,<br />
            Leave them where the wild rose grows:<br />
            Being heard above the din,<br />
            Calling out and drawing in,<br />
            Welcoming the circling dove,<br />
            Honoring the name of Love.<br />
            The Evil One will be here too,<br />
            Our waking giving him the cue<br />
            His wicked efforts to redouble.<br />
            The world will groan: toil and trouble!<br />
            Perhaps too few will we three be.<br />
            Faith, Hope and Love agree<br />
            That human help is needed sorely,<br />
            That gods alone must render poorly.
