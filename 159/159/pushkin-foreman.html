<div>
<p class="intropoem">My spirit wracked by thirst for grace,<br />
I wandered in a darkling land<br />
Till at a crossing of the ways<br />
I saw a six-wing'd Seraph stand.<br />
With fingers light as dream at night<br />
He brushed mine eyes and they grew bright<br />
Opening unto prophecies<br />
Wild as a startled eaglet's eyes.<br />
He touched mine ears. Then noise and sound<br />
Poured into me from all around:<br />
I heard the shudders of the sky,<br />
The sweep of angel hosts on high,<br />
The creep of beasts below in the seas,<br />
The seep of sap in valley trees.<br />
Then leaning to my lips he wrung<br />
Thereout my sinful little tongue<br />
Of guile and idle caviling;<br />
And with his bloody fingertips<br />
He set between my wasting lips<br />
A Serpent's wise and forkèd sting.<br />
And with his sword he cleft my chest<br />
And ripped my quaking heart out whole,<br />
And in my sundered breast he pressed<br />
A blazing shard of living coal.<br />
There in the desert I lay dead<br />
Until the voice from heaven said:<br />
"Arise O Prophet! Work My will,<br />
Thou that hast now perceived and heard.<br />
On land and sea thy charge fulfill<br />
And burn Man's heart with this My Word."</p>
