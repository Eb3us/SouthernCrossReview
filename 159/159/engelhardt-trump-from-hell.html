<p class="intro">Donald Trump is all too literally the candidate from hell and, yes,
he’s threatening to take the United States and the world to — no place
else! — hell and back. He’s the greatest danger to this planet
imaginable. And I’m not even thinking about what else he’d do, were he
to win election 2024 and return to the Oval Office, having <a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/30/donald-trump-wont-have-to-vote-anymore-fox-interview">reassured</a>
his religious voters that, should they opt for him this November,
they’ll never have to do so again. (“Get out and vote, just this time…
You won’t have to do it anymore. Four more years, you know what? It’ll
be fixed, it’ll be fine, you won’t have to vote anymore, my beautiful
Christians.”)</p>
<p>Forget all of that, including the <a
href="https://www.npr.org/2024/08/03/g-s1-15174/harris-mixed-race-trump-black-indian">racism</a>,
the madness, the <a
href="https://www.npr.org/2023/12/19/1220443867/trump-s-rhetoric-is-drawing-alarming-comparisons-to-autocratic-leaders-and-dicta">urge</a>
to transform this country into the all-American equivalent of an
autocracy. Forget every last bit of it — even if, yes, that’s one hell
of a lot to forget! Instead, focus on just one thing: Donald Trump and
his crew, including that gem J.D. Vance, who attacked what he called “<a
href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/j-d-vance-leads-attacks-on-green-new-scam-at-convention/">the
Green New Scam</a>” at the Republican convention, are determined to
fossil-fuelize our future in a fashion never before seen, not at least
under these circumstances.</p>
<p>And unfortunately, Donald Trump is anything but alone. (Do you hear
me, <a
href="https://www.climatechangenews.com/2024/03/12/despite-putin-promises-russias-emissions-keep-rising/">Vladimir
Putin</a>?) In fact, according to a recent <a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/05/climate-change-denial-congress"><em>Guardian</em>
report</a>, almost one-quarter of this country’s congressional
representatives (100 members of the House and 23 senators) deny the very
existence of climate change — and be shocked, very shocked, but every
last one of them is a Republican! In what now passes for the mainstream,
The Donald and his vice-presidential buddy, the very opposite of “<a
href="https://www.npr.org/2024/07/29/nx-s1-5055616/jd-vance-childless-cat-lady-history">cat
ladies</a>,” are extreme but all too common examples of the urge to heat
this planet to the boiling point or beyond. Admittedly, the competition
is fierce. After all, whatever steps President Joe Biden took in
relation to climate change — and he did <a
href="https://grist.org/politics/one-year-in-the-inflation-reduction-act-is-working-kind-of/">take
them</a> and they will make a difference — American <a
href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61545">oil
production</a> and <a
href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61584">oil</a> and
<a
href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/us-was-top-lng-exporter-2023-hit-record-levels-2024-01-02/">natural
gas</a> exports all set staggering new global records during his term in
office.</p>
<p>Still, there’s no question about one thing: Donald Trump, J.D. Vance,
and crew are determined to fully reject that Green New Scam (as
Republicans now love to call it), which means the two of them are intent
on making you, me, and everyone else on this planet sweat, sweat, sweat.
I say that given the fact that, only recently, humanity experienced the
hottest day ever recorded and the <a
href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/07/23/hottest-day-ever-recorded-climate-change/">very
next day</a> set an even more feverish daily global record. And that,
mind you, was after 13 straight months each of which (including two
Junes) set new heat records for human history (and probably far beyond
it), and all of that, in turn (if you don’t mind the longest, hottest
sentence imaginable), came after 2023 set a global record as the hottest
year ever — and count on this: I’m undoubtedly leaving all sorts of
things out.</p>
<p>Yikes, I’m already sweating!</p>
<p><strong>A Green New Scam President?</strong></p>
<p>Given the recent withdrawal of 81-year-old Joe Biden from the
presidential race, 78-year-old Donald Trump is now the oldest American
presidential candidate ever (yes, ever!), so why should he give a damn
about how hot our future could become? Admittedly, there are his kids
and grandkids to consider, but it’s not clear that, even when it comes
to them (and despite his recent <a
href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/maga-wing-trump-family-takes-center-stage-rcna161293">family-ization</a>
of the Republican convention), he gives a damn about anyone other than…
yes, Donald Trump. Based on the last few years of him, I doubt it. In
the most literal sense possible, as far as he’s concerned, he’s always
the man of the moment. Any moment. And if the moment isn’t his, then to
hell with it and everything else!</p>
<p>And believe me, under the circumstances, I’m not just using “hell”
figuratively.</p>
<p>After all, this planet and this country are both growing hotter all
too quickly. This was already one hell of a summer in the United States.
State after state, city after city <a
href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/j-d-vance-leads-attacks-on-green-new-scam-at-convention/">simply
broiled</a>, while records were regularly set across the globe. (Hey,
Las Vegas hit a <a
href="https://www.npr.org/2024/07/08/nx-s1-5032849/las-vegas-hits-a-new-record-high-of-120-degrees-fahrenheit">new
city high</a> of 120 degrees Fahrenheit in July and, in breaking local
heat records, it was anything but atypical.) After all, June, as I
mentioned, was the <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/11/climate/global-warming-heat-records.html">13th
straight hottest month</a> of its kind ever. And while later in the
summer, we might get a slight break from such record-setting
temperatures, the future looks all too grim. While you’re at it,
consider yourself lucky that you don’t live in someplace like Dubai,
where on one recent anything-but-atypical July day the temperature hit
113 and the heat index 144. In fact, the <em>Washington Post</em> now <a
href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/07/18/persian-gulf-dubai-heat-climate/">suggests</a>
that the Persian Gulf region may be the “most likely to regularly exceed
life-threatening heat thresholds during the next 30 to 50 years.”</p>

<div class="container"><p>Buy the Book!</p></div></div></a>
<p>Of course, only this summer, Donald Trump held a rally in Phoenix,
Arizona, where the temperature hit… go ahead, just for hell of it, take
a guess!</p>
<p>Yes, <a
href="https://www.npr.org/2024/06/25/nx-s1-5006573/trump-election-2024-climate-change-fossil-fuels">113
degrees</a>! Eleven of his listeners were treated right there for heat
exhaustion on “stretchers hooked to IV bags,” while The Donald continued
to “rail against wind turbines and electric vehicles.” And mind you,
unlike the acts of the assassin whose bullet hit Trump’s ear at that
rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, the former president’s statements in
Arizona blasting any efforts to deal with this overheating globe of ours
weren’t considered acts of violence.</p>
<p>And I’m not even including <a
href="https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2024/07/what-project-2025-would-do-to-climate-policy-in-the-us/">Project
2025</a>, a Heritage Foundation greenhouse-gas nightmare of a document
prepared for the possible second term of the president who called
climate change “<a
href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2022/03/06/trump-focuses-foreign-policy-speech-gops-top-donors/">a
great hoax</a>” and once <a
href="https://democrats.org/news/donald-the-denier-donald-trump-has-repeatedly-called-climate-change-a-hoax/">said
sarcastically</a>, “The oceans are going to rise 1/100th of an inch in
the next 300 years and it’s going to kill everybody,” while <a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jun/03/trump-big-oil-campaign-pitch-corruption">insisting</a>
“that windmills cause cancer and that electric cars are ‘bad’ for the
environment.” After all, despite the fact that so many of Project 2025’s
creators at that “<a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/27/project-2025-dismantle-us-climate-policy-next-republican-president">notorious
rightwing climate-denying think tank</a>” were former Trumpian officials
and J.D. Vance is <a
href="https://newrepublic.com/article/184393/jd-vance-violent-foreword-kevin-roberts-project-2025-leader-book">closely
tied</a> to it, the former president has <a
href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/project-2025-trump-heritage-foundation-what-know-rcna161338">claimed</a>
it has absolutely nothing to do with him. Still, here’s the Trumpian
essence of it all: he’s always been a fossil-fuelizer of the first
order; the oil and gas industry has <a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jun/03/trump-big-oil-campaign-pitch-corruption">backed</a>
his presidential runs big-time; and he seems desperately eager to do it
all (and more) again. As he so classically put the matter during this
election campaign: on day one back in the Oval Office, he’s going to <a
href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/05/22/donald-trump-oil-industry-fundraiser/73803933007/">act
like</a> a “dictator<strong>”</strong> and, above all, institute
a”drill, baby, drill” regime for the next four years (and undoubtedly
beyond). He and his key officials the second time around are going to do
their damnedest, in other words, to encourage the long-term, full-scale
overheating of this planet.</p>
<p>The plans that he and J.D. Vance have when it comes to fossil fuels
should make anyone’s hair stand on end (even someone as bald as me).
After all, he’s already promised that, above all else, when he next
enters the Oval Office, his main goal will be to “<a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jun/10/trump-rallies-extreme-heat">drill,
baby, drill</a>.” You can’t be more blunt than that when it comes to
encouraging the fossil-fuel companies from whom you recently <a
href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/05/09/trump-oil-industry-campaign-money/">demanded</a>
a fortune in election funding.</p>
<p>And that’s obviously just the beginning. He and his crew have <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/26/climate/climate-policies-trump-would-reverse.html">promised
to</a> wipe out anything the Biden administration did aimed at dealing
with climate change and fossil fuels while nixing any steps taken to
support the creation of clean energy. Instead, he would “develop the
liquid gold that is right under our feet” and “unleash domestic energy
production like never before.” From obliterating wind power projects
(“<a
href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/04/17/trump-wind-power-oil-executives/">I
hate wind</a>”) to promoting oil and natural gas drilling from the Gulf
of Mexico to the Alaskan Arctic, there’s no end to what he and his
cronies have in mind. He and his “team” may even be ready to
systematically dismantle, if not <a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/feb/09/trump-epa-plan-environment">obliterate</a>
the Environmental Protection Agency (which, in case you’ve forgotten,
was created in 1970 by a Republican president, Richard Nixon, who did
little else right). Donald Trump’s next presidency, in other words, will
clearly force the U.S. government to literally worship at the foot (or
the oil rig) of the fossil-fuel companies.</p>
<p><strong>The Slow-Motion Equivalent of a Nuclear War</strong></p>
<p>To put all of this in some grim perspective, the British outfit
Carbon Brief estimated that, by 2030, a Trump presidency would add <a
href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-trump-election-win-could-add-4bn-tonnes-to-us-emissions-by-2030/">approximately
four billion more tons</a> of greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere
than another Biden administration (or, assumedly, one run by <a
href="https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2024/07/how-kamala-harris-and-donald-trump-compare-on-climate-change/">Kamala
Harris</a>). And all of that means that a country and a world already
overheating at a record pace would do so in an even more dramatically
grim fashion.</p>
<p>The startling thing is that, on this distinctly overheating planet of
ours, a person whose platform is essentially an oil or natural
gas-drilling rig should have the faintest chance of being elected
president. It’s not all that complicated really. Leaving aside any other
issue, voting for Donald Trump in our already rapidly warming world
would be — all too literally — a suicidal act.</p>
<p>And keep in mind that, even before Donald Trump returns to the Oval
Office a second time (should he win in November), the news daily has
gotten ever worse. As a start, we’re talking about a country that, in
the Biden years and despite the money that he and his crew began <a
href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/the-biden-administration-has-taken-more-climate-action-than-any-other-in-history/">investing</a>
in climate-change-mitigating activities, <a
href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61545">set its
sixth</a> consecutive yearly record in 2023 for producing oil (more than
any other country on the planet) and another for exporting <a
href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61584">oil</a> and
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61823">natural
gas</a>, while the giant U.S. oil companies continued to garner <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/02/business/oil-gas-companies-profits.html">record
profits</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, climate change is hardly the only danger on planet Earth
right now. There’s the potentially explosive set of horrors underway in
Gaza and elsewhere in the Middle East that could erupt into something
far worse at any moment. (Ominously enough, the U.S. only <a
href="https://www.npr.org/2024/08/03/nx-s1-5062390/us-military-deployment-middle-east-israel-iran">recently
dispatched</a> yet more warships and planes to the region.) And there
are other dangers, including the possibility of a future war with China,
a potential <a
href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-putin-nuclear-weapons-82ced2419d93ae733161b56fbd9b477d">nuclear
face-off</a> with Russia, or even (should Donald Trump lose the election
this year), a rise in violence in this country, if not some possible
version of a <a
href="https://www.wdtn.com/news/your-local-election-hq/local-state-senator-apologizes-for-civil-war-remark-during-vance-rally/">civil
war</a> here at home.</p>
<p>But put in proper perspective, climate change should be seen as the
slow-motion equivalent of a nuclear war on this planet, one that — not
in a day, a week, a month, or a year — but over the decades to come,
could make our world ever less livable, ever less ours. While a
full-scale nuclear exchange could almost instantly create a “nuclear
winter” that <a
href="https://www.rutgers.edu/news/nuclear-war-would-cause-global-famine-and-kill-billions-rutgers-led-study-finds">might
result</a> in up to five billion of us dying of hunger, climate change
could devastate this planet in a similarly horrific fashion, just over
the (very) long term.</p>
<p>So, consider a vote for Donald Trump a vote for nothing less than
destroying the Earth as a livable environment for… well, all of those to
come. And given the apocalyptic nature of that, don’t you find it
strange that Trump’s climate-change views and his ultimate support for
the fossil fuel industry above all else (except himself) haven’t gotten
more attention in this election season?</p>
<p>Anyone who lived through the last blistering year should realize that
global heat of an unprecedented sort isn’t anywhere near a high point
but, given the fossil fuels still pouring into the atmosphere (including
<a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jul/30/methane-emissions-study">staggering
amounts</a> of methane, a gas that heats the planet faster than any
other), at something closer to a low point. And under the circumstances,
Donald (“drill, baby, drill”) Trump should be considered, not
figuratively but all too literally, the presidential candidate from…
yes, hell. Voting for him would be voting for, in historical (and
Christian) terms, the devil and that’s not just an image but potentially
an all-too-literal reality.</p>
<p>As president, Donald Trump would undoubtedly prove to be a
first-class global heat machine and voting for him would be the
slow-motion equivalent of putting an atomic weapon in the Oval
Office. Quite a prospect, don’t you think?</p>
