Volume One, Lesson Two\
Translated by Frank Thomas Smith

**Dornach, February 22, 1924**

My dear friends,

We will relate what is said today to the previous lesson, partly to
preserve the thread, and partly because there are members present who
were not here last time. We shall therefore start with a short
recapitulation of the last lesson.

We proceeded in thought to the place where the human being -- who with
normal consciousness can grasp the sense-world, which is the world that
surrounds him -- can feel himself related to the super-sensible, related
to a being which corresponds to his own being. And we want to first
develop this sensation before proceeding to the mysteries of the
spiritual life, which we will do shortly.

The first sensation should make us aware of how the human being, in his
normal condition, lives surrounded by the world of the senses, which
however he is not able to identify with his own being. We shall
therefore develop this theme. And although the words "Know thyself!"
have been enunciated throughout the ages, encouraging man to perform his
noblest deeds, still he can find no answers, no satisfaction if, under
the influence of "Know thyself", he only sees what the senses provide --
the exterior world. Now, however, he is directed towards something else,
something beyond the exterior world.

If with this sensation, which one can have when one gazes out to the
depths of cosmic space with the question of his own being in mind, when
in thought we approach super-sensible being, which is one with the inner
human being, then the corresponding sensation will be given through the
words I provided to you the last time:

> > Where on earth-foundations, color upon color,\
> > Life creative manifests itself;\
> > Where from earthly substance, form on form,\
> > The lifeless world is fashioned;\
> > Where the sentient beings, powerful in will,\
> > Delight in the warm glow of their existence;\
> > Where you yourself, O Man, derive\
> > Your bodily existence from earth and air and light:
> > 
> > There you do enter, for your own true-being,\
> > Cold, night-enveloped darkness.\
> > In vain you ask of the dumb expanse\
> > What you are, what you were, or will become.\
> > For your own being, this light of day grows dim\
> > To the soul\'s night, the darkness of the spirit.\
> > Then do you turn your anxious seeking soul\
> > Unto that light that shines out of the darkness.

We can now observe and feel in our souls the beauty, the greatness and
the sublimity of the external world, but we also realize that we can
never find our own being in this world. For the person who seeks the
spirit, it is necessary to repeatedly feel this sensation in his soul.
Because by deeply experiencing the sensation that by looking out into
the external world we gain no answer to the question of who we are,
feeling this sensation again and again gives the soul the impulse and
the strength that can carry us into the spiritual world. Yet just as by
having this sensation we will be carried up into the spiritual world, we
must also bear in mind that the person of normal consciousness in normal
life is unprepared to encounter that world, which in reality is the
world of his own being.

Therefore on the border between the sense-world and the spiritual world
that guardian stands who earnestly warns people against crossing over
into the spiritual world unprepared. And it is the case, my dear
friends, that we must always keep in mind the fact that the Guardian
stands before the \[entrance to\] the spiritual world for the well-being
of unprepared human beings. And we must therefore be quite clear about
the necessity for a certain attitude of soul in order to achieve real
knowledge and insight.

If such insight were provided to everyone walking down the street it
would be terrible for them because they wouldn\'t be prepared. They
would be receiving it without the preparatory attitude of soul.
Therefore we must deeply feel the second sensation which over and over
again tells us how we must approach the Guardian:

> > And from the darkness there appears,\
> > In your own likeness manifesting you,\
> > Yet forming you into a deeper parable,\
> > Mightily working, in the cosmic ether,\
> > The solemn spirit-word your heart can hear.
> > 
> > The Spirit-Messenger to you: he who alone\
> > Can lighten up your path.\
> > Before him lie the far-spread fields of sense-existence,\
> > Behind him yawn the depths of the abyss.
> > 
> > And here, before the darkness of the spirit-fields,\
> > Hard by the yawning chasm of existence,\
> > Rings forth the ancient power of his creator-word:\
> > Behold, I am the only gate of knowledge.

Then the Guardian himself speaks while we are still on this side, in the
sense-fields. He points to the other side where for us is unmitigated
darkness while we are on this side, but which is to become light-filled,
which must become light to us through spirit-knowledge, from out of
which he speaks who alone is bright. He speaks, indicating the apparent
darkness, this maya-darkness:

> > From the wide expanse of beings in space\
> > Who experience existence in light;\
> > From the tread of time\'s onward course\
> > Which finds in creating its very activity;\
> > From the depths of the feeling heart\
> > Where in the Self the world is founded:
> > 
> > There resounds in the soul\'s utterance,\
> > There shines from the spirit\'s thoughts\
> > Which from divine healing forces\
> > In the cosmic-creative powers\
> > Weave the mighty existential words:\
> > O Man, know thyself!

Whoever can feel deeply enough the words which resound from the
Guardian\'s mouth, if he looks back upon himself, will realize that this
looking back, the perception in looking back, constitutes the first
stage of self-knowledge. Self-knowledge which is preparatory for the
true self-knowledge which reveals spiritual cosmic knowledge of the
being which is one with our own humanity. And then the knowledge arises
which one can obtain on this side of the threshold of spiritual
existence, knowledge which reveals the contamination in our own
thinking, feeling and willing in terrible but true images; as three
beasts arising from the yawning abyss between the sense-world and the
spirit-world.

What we should feel at the abyss of being between the maya, the
illusion, and the real world, should appear before our souls as the
fourth sensation.

> > Yet you must beware of the abyss;\
> > Otherwise its beasts will devour\
> > You, if you pass by me in haste.\
> > Your cosmic age has placed them there\
> > In you as enemies of knowledge.
> > 
> > Behold the first beast, the crooked back\
> > The bony head, the scrawny body,\
> > His skin is all a dullish blue;\
> > Your fear of creative spiritual being\
> > Begat the monster in your will;\
> > Knowledge bravery alone will overcome it.

We must be quite clear, my dear friends, that bravery in acquiring
knowledge is not present at first in the soul, but cowardice for
acquiring knowledge is what dominates. Especially in our time that
cowardice is what holds back most people from even approaching an
insight into the spiritual world.

> > Behold the second beast, it bares\
> > Its teeth in a warped face, scornfully it lies,\
> > Yellow with gray spots is its body;\
> > Your hate of spiritual revelation\
> > Begat this weakling in your feeling;\
> > Your burning thirst for knowledge must subdue him.

That is the second thing that we have within us -- which plants doubt in
our soul, every kind of uncertainty about the spiritual world. It is
inherent in feeling, because feeling is weak and cannot rise to
enthusiasm. True knowledge must outgrow superficial enthusiasm which
trails all kinds of cheap external life. Inner enthusiasm, inner fire
which becomes a burning thirst for knowledge; that is what overcomes the
second beast.

> > Behold the third beast, with cloven muzzle,\
> > Its eye is glassy, posture slouching,\
> > Dirty-red its form appears to you;\
> > Your doubts in the power of spiritual light\
> > Begat this ghost within your thinking;\
> > Your creative knowledge must make it yield.

We must find the courage and the fire to bring activity to our thinking.
When we create with ordinary consciousness we create arbitrarily, we
create what is not real. When, however, we correctly prepare ourselves
for creative thinking, the spiritual world streams into our creative
thinking. And then, due to knowledge-bravery, to a burning thirst for
knowledge and to creative knowledge, we are truly standing in the
spiritual world.

> > Only when you have overcome all three\
> > Will wings sprout from your soul\
> > To fly the abyss over,\
> > Which separates you from the knowledge fields\
> > To which your heart desires\
> > to consecrate itself in healing.

Such sensations can lead to feeling what we must activate in ourselves
in order to enter the spiritual world as genuine, living human beings.
In ordinary life it is often the most banal things which cause us to
realize that life is serious and not a mere game. But what leads to
knowledge does not impress us as much as exterior life does. It is all
too easily made a game. And one is convinced that the game is in
earnest. But one harms one\'s self and others greatly by playing at
spiritual striving, by not being completely earnest about it.

This earnestness should not be expressed as sentimentality. Humor may be
called for with respect to some aspects of life. But the humor must then
be serious. When we compare earnestness with mere game-playing, it is
not sentimentality, false piety or the rolling of eyes as opposed to
games. Rather is it the possibility of really concentrating on spiritual
striving and consistently and wholeheartedly living in it.

In order to sense the importance of what I am saying, my dear friends,
it would be really good for spiritual striving if all the friends who
are sitting here -- especially those who have been in the
Anthroposophical Society for a long time -- to ask themselves the
following question: How often have I resolved to undertake some task
related to anthroposophical life, and how often have I completely
forgotten about it after a short time? Perhaps I would have done it if I
had thought about it, but I did not think about it any more. It was
extinguished, just as a dream is extinguished.

It is neither meaningless nor unimportant to ask yourselves such a
question. And perhaps it would not be unimportant if a large number of
our friends were to undertake something in this direction now.

The Christmas Conference \[1923\] was to be the beginning of true
esotericism pouring into the entire anthroposophical worldview stream,
supported by the Anthroposophical Society. How often -- one can ask --
have I forgotten what I found to be quite beautiful during the Christmas
Conference and in my thoughts and feelings continued as though the
Anthroposophical Society were the same as it was before the Christmas
Conference. And if someone says: that is not the case with me, it could
be quite important for that person to ask himself: Am I fooling myself
to think it is not the case with me? In respect to all anthroposophical
activity have I realized that a new phase of the Anthroposophical
Society has begun? To ask this question is very significant, for then
the correct earnestness enters the soul.

And you see, this is connected to the life-blood of the Anthroposophical
Society and therefore to the life-blood of every member who has
requested acceptance in the Class; and it is good if it relates to
something which exerts a strong influence in life. Therefore it would be
good if all those who wish to belong to the Class ask themselves: Isn\'t
there something I can do -- now that the Anthroposophical Society has
been re-founded -- do differently than previously. Couldn\'t I introduce
something new into my life as an anthroposophist? Couldn\'t I change the
way I acted previously by introducing something new?

That would be enormously important, if taken seriously, for every
individual who belongs to the Class. For thereby it would be possible
for the Class to continue without being burdened by such heavy baggage.
For everyone who keeps to the old humdrum routine burdens the progress
of the Class. It is perhaps not noticeable, but true nevertheless. In
esoteric life there is no possibility of introducing what is so
prevalent in life: interpreting lies as truth. If one tries to do this
in esoteric life it is not the interpretation which matters, but the
truth. In esoteric life only the truth works, nothing else. You may
color something because of vanity, but what has been colored makes no
impression on the the spiritual world. The unvarnished truth is what is
effective in the spiritual world.

From all this you can judge how different spiritual realities are --
which under the surface of life work today as always -- from what
everyday life shows, patched up as it is with so many lies. Very little
of what passes today between people is true. To continually remind
ourselves of this belongs to the beginning of work within the Class. For
only with this notion can we find the strength to cooperate here in the
Class with what will be unfolded in our souls from lesson to lesson in
order that we may find the path to the spiritual world.

For we will only be able to recognize what must be cultivated in our
thinking, feeling and willing in order for the three beasts to be
defeated: thinking, the thought - phantom; feeling - mockery; willing -
the bony crookedness of spirit. For these three beasts are the enemies
of knowledge. We see them in the mirror, but as realities from the
yawning abyss of being.

And deeply rooted with our humanity is everything which hinders us from
real knowledge, firstly in our thinking. Normal human thinking is
reflected in the thought-phantom of the first beast, the form of which
was described thus:

> > Behold the third beast, with cloven muzzle,\
> > Its eye is glassy, posture slouching,\
> > Dirty-red its form appears to you;

It is the image of ordinary human thinking which thinks about things of
the outside world and doesn\'t realize that such thinking is a corpse.
Where did the being live whose corpse this ordinary thinking is?

Yes, my dear friends, nowadays -- in accordance with contemporary
civilization -- when thinking from waking in the morning till retiring
at night according to the guidance given us in school and in life
itself, our thinking is a corpse. It is dead. When did it live, and
where?

It lived before we were born; it lived when our souls were in
pre-earthly existence. Just as you imagine, dear friends, that the human
being lives on the physical earth animated by his soul within and he
goes around in this physical body until his death, when the animating
soul is invisible to external observation and the corpse is visible --
the dead form of the human figure. You must imagine this related to
thinking. A living, organic, growing, moving being possessed it before
the human being entered into earthly existence. Then it becomes a corpse
buried in our own heads, in our brains. And just as if a corpse in the
tomb were to declare: I am the man! so declares our thinking when it
lies buried in the brain as a corpse and thinks about the external
things of the world. It is a corpse. It is perhaps depressing to realize
that it is a corpse, but it is true, and esoteric knowledge must hold to
the truth.

That is the meaning of the Guardian of the Threshold\'s words. After he
has described the warning of the three beasts, he continues. And the
words which resound in our hearts are these:

> > The third beast\'s glassy eye,\
> > Is the evil counterpart\
> > of thinking, that denies itself\
> > In you and chooses death,\
> > Forsaking the spirit-force\
> > which before it\'s earthly life\
> > Lived its life in fields of spirit.
 
I repeat it:
 
> > The third beast\'s glassy eye,\
> > Is the evil counterpart\
> > of thinking, that denies itself\
> > In you and chooses death,\
> > Forsaking the spirit-force\
> > which before it\'s earthly life\
> > Lived its life in fields of spirit.

Thinking, with which we achieve so much here in the sense-world, for the
gods of the cosmos is the corpse of our soul\'s being. By entering into
an earthly existence we have died in thinking during this time on earth.
The death of thinking had gradually been preparing itself since the year
333 A.D. The middle of the fourth post-Atlantean period. Before that
life had poured into thinking, which was the heritage of pre-earthly
existence. The Greeks felt that vitality, as did the Orientals, in that
they thought of thinking as being the work of the spirit, of the gods.
They knew, in that they thought, that in every thought the god lived.
That has been lost. Thinking has become dead. And we must heed the
message of the times that reaches us through the Guardian:

> > Yet you must beware of the abyss;\
> > otherwise your beasts will consume you\
> > If you hastily pass me by;\
> > Your cosmic age has put them in\
> > You, as enemies of knowledge.

This cosmic age began in the year 333 after Christianity began, after
the first third of the fourth century had passed. And now thinking,
devoid of the force of life, is clearly present in everything. And the
dead thinking of the nineteenth century forced dead materialism to the
surface of human civilization. It is different with feeling. The
greatest enemy of humanity, Ahriman, has not yet been able to kill
feeling in the same way he killed thinking. Feeling also lives in human
beings in the present cosmic age. But man has to a great extent driven
this feeling down from full consciousness into the halfway unconscious.
Feeling arises in the soul. Who has it in his power, as he has thinking
in his power? To whom is it clear what lives in feeling as it is clear
to him what lives in thinking?

Take one of the saddest -- to the spirit saddest -- occurrences of our
times, my dear friends. When people think clearly they are citizens of
the world, for they well know that thinking makes you human, even when
it is dead in the present age.

But people are separated by their feeling into nations, and especially
today they let this unconscious feeling dominate in the worst possible
way. Because people feel themselves as only belonging to a certain
group, all kinds of conflicts arise.

Nevertheless, world karma places us in a certain human group, and it is
our feeling that acts as an instrument of world karma when we are placed
in this tribe, in that class, in that nation. It is not through thinking
that we are so placed. Thinking, if it is not colored by feeling and
willing, is the same thinking everywhere. Feeling, however, is graduated
according to the different regions of the world. Feeling lies halfway in
the unconscious, alive yes, but in the unconscious. Therefore the
ahrimanic spirit, unable to exert influence on the living part, uses the
opportunity to agitate in the unconscious. And he concentrates this
agitation on the confusion between truth and error. All our prejudices
based on feeling are colored by ahrimanic influences and impulses.

If we want to enter the spiritual world this feeling must rise up before
our souls. We must be able to include feeling in the development of
knowledge. Through constant review of our own being, we must be able to
know what kind of persons we are as feeling human beings. This is not
easy. With thinking it is relatively easy to achieve clarity about
ourselves. We don\'t always do it, but it is still easier to admit: you
are not exactly a genius, or you lack clear thinking about this or that.
At the most, it is either vanity or opportunism which prevents us from
achieving clarity about our thinking.

But with feeling we never really get to the point of observing ourselves
in our souls. We are always convinced that the direction of our feeling
is the correct one. We must delve most intimately into our souls if we
wish to know ourselves as feeling human beings. Only by facing ourselves
directly with complete conscientiousness do we lift ourselves up, do we
lift ourselves up over the obstacles which the second beast places
before us on the path to the spiritual world.

Otherwise, if we do not occasionally practice this self-knowledge as
feeling human beings, then we will always develop a mocking countenance
with respect to the spiritual world. Because we are not conscious of our
ailing feeling capacity, we are also unconscious of being mockers of the
spiritual world. We disguise the mockery in all possible forms, but we
are still mocking the spiritual world. And it is just those, of whom I
spoke previously, who lack earnestness, who are the scoffers. They are
sometimes embarrassed to express the mockery even to themselves, but
they are still mocking the spiritual world. For how can one lack
seriousness regarding the spiritual world, playing games about it,
without mocking it. To such as they the Guardian speaks:

> > The second beast\'s mocking countenance\
> > Is the evil counter-force of feeling,\
> > Which hollows out its own soul\
> > And creates an empty life\
> > Instead of fullness of spirit\
> > With light from the force of the sun\
> > Before earthly existence.

The first beast is the reflection of our will. The will does not only
dream, it does not lie only half in the unconscious; it lies completely
in the unconscious.

I have often described to you, my dear friends, how the will lies deep
in the unconscious. And deep in the unconscious is where man seeks the
paths of his karma, at least for ordinary consciousness. Every step that
a person takes in life related to karma is measured. But he knows
nothing about it. It is all unconscious. Previous earth-lives work
forcefully into his karma. Karma leads us to our life\'s crises, to our
decisions, to our doubts. Here we meet the individual\'s aberrations,
the person who lives only for himself, and seeks only his own way. In
thinking: one seeks the path which all men seek. In feeling: one seeks
the path which his group seeks. In feeling we recognize if someone is
from the north, from the west or the south, from eastern, southern or
central Europe. One must concentrate on the will\'s unconscious impulses
in order to see another human being as a single individual, rather than
merely a human being in general or a member of a group. This is an act
of will -- but also deep in the unconscious. The first beast shows the
aberrations of the will.

> > The Guardian reminds us:\
> > The first beast\'s bony spirit:\
> > The will\'s evil creative power,\
> > Which would estrange your own body\
> > From the soul\'s inherent strength\
> > And devote it to the counter-forces,\
> > Which would steal in future time\
> > Cosmic being from the gods.

In our will\'s work the spiritual powers which want to strip our bodies
from us during our earthly existence and therewith take a portion of our
souls with it, in order to build an earth which does not continue to
develop \[in the future\] as Jupiter, Venus, Vulcan. Rather the earth is
to be sundered from divine intentions and stolen at some point in the
future. Together with the earth stolen from the gods, the human being
would be united with certain powers which work in his will\...the same
will through which he seeks his karma.

The first beast is surely capable of revealing in a mirror-image what is
working in the will: bony head, dried-out body with dull blue skin, the
crooked back. It is the Ahrimanic spirit, which acts in the will when
karma is being sought and which can only be overcome by the courage of
knowledge. So the Guardian of the Threshold speaks about this beast as I
have just described.

I will read it again:

> > The first beast\'s bony spirit:\
> > The will\'s evil creative power,\
> > Which would estrange your own body\
> > From the soul\'s inherent strength\
> > And devote it to the counter-forces,\
> > Which would steal in future time\
> > Cosmic being from the gods.

In these words from the Guardian of the Threshold\'s mouth resound
further the warning to the human being seeking knowledge and insight.

Let these words live most intensively in our souls, my dear friends, and
let us listen often to the Guardian\'s words:

> > The third beast\'s glassy eye,\
> > Is the evil counterpart\
> > of thinking, that denies itself\
> > In you and chooses death,\
> > Forsaking the spirit-force\
> > which before it\'s earthly life\
> > Lived its life in fields of spirit.

Once again, you must grasp the concordance in these verses
\[The first stanza of this mantra is written on the blackboard:\]

> > *The third beast\'s glassy eye,\
> > Is the evil counterpart\
> > of thinking, that denies itself\
> > In you and chooses death,\
> > Forsaking the spirit-force\
> > which before it\'s earthly life\
> > Lived its life in fields of spirit.*

At first we feel what each stanza contains.
The second stanza refers to feeling:
\[The second stanza is written on the blackboard.\] 

> > *The second beast\'s mocking countenance\
> > Is the *evil* counter-force of feeling,\
> > *"counter-force", no longer "part", but "force"!*\
> > Which hollows out its own soul\
> > And creates an empty life\
> > Instead of fullness of spirit\
> > With light from the force of the sun\
> > Before earthly existence.*

Now we feel first: "denies", and now "hollows out" and feel the nuance that enters into the verses by "denies", becoming "hollows out".

The Guardian\'s words directed to will:

> > The first beast\'s bony spirit:\
> > The will\'s evil creative power,\
> > Which would estrange your own body\
> > From the soul\'s inherent strength\
> > And devote it to the counter-forces,\
> > Which would steal in future time\
> > Cosmic being from the gods.

\[This stanza is written on the blackboard:\]

> > *The first beast\'s bony spirit:\
> > The will\'s evil creative power,*

Now no longer "image" or "force", but "power". You must feel the
escalation.

> > *Which would estrange your own body*

and now you have here the escalation: first the intellectual: "denies";
then instigation in inner life: "hollows out": then what completely
eliminates inner life: "estrange".

> > From the soul\'s inherent strength\
> > And devote it to the counter-forces,\
> > Which would steal in future time\
> > Cosmic being from the gods.

Note that in all three stanzas the word "evil" echoes. \[The word is
underlined.\] And if you observe and feel the critical points in the
escalations and in the difference between thinking, feeling and willing
\[the words are underlined\], and if you correctly sense how all three
are united by the always recurring word "evil", then, my dear friends,
each stanza will become a mantram for you, according to its inner
meaning. And they can become a guide on the three stages to the
spiritual world -- that of the third beast, of the second beast and of
the first beast. And if you never omit these three concordances and
never fail to unite the three by the one decisive word towards an inner
soul-organism, then they will become your guide, my dear friends, on the
path past the Guardian of the Threshold and into the spiritual world.

We will get to know him better in the following lessons.

> > The third beast\'s glassy eye,\
> > Is the ***evil*** counter*part*\
> > of *thinking*, that *denies* itself\
> > In you and chooses death,\
> > Forsaking the spirit-force\
> > which before it\'s earthly life\
> > Lived its life in fields of spirit.

> > The second beast\'s mocking countenance\
> > Is the ***evil*** counter-*force* of *feeling*,\
> > Which *hollows out* its own soul
> > And creates an empty life\
> > Instead of fullness of spirit\
> > With light from the force of the sun\
> > Before earthly existence.

> > The first beast\'s bony spirit:\
> > The will\'s ***evil*** creative *power*,\
> > Which would *estrange* your own body\
> > From the soul\'s inherent strength\
> > And devote it to the counter-forces,\
> > Which would steal in future time\
> > Cosmic being from the gods.
