# The Song of the Smoke

## [W. E. B. Du Bois](https://poets.org/poet/w-e-b-du-bois)

I am the smoke king,\
I am black.\
      I am swinging in the sky,\
      I am ringing worlds on high;\
      I am the thought of the throbbing mills,\
      I am the soul of the Soul toil kills,\
      I am the ripple of trading rills.\
Up I'm curling from the sod,\
I am whirling home to God.\
I am the smoke king,\
I am black.

I am the smoke king,\
I am black.\
      I am wreathing broken hearts,\
      I am sheathing devils' darts;\
      Dark inspiration of iron times,\
      Wedding the toil of toiling climes,\
      Shedding the blood of bloodless crimes,\
Down I lower in the blue,\
Up I tower toward the true.\
I am the smoke king,\
I am black.

I am the smoke king,\
I am black.\
      I am darkening with song,\
      I am hearkening to wrong;\
      I will be black as blackness can,\
      The blacker the mantle the mightier the man,\
      My purpl'ing midnights no day dawn may ban.\
I am carving God in night,\
I am painting Hell in white.\
I am the smoke king,\
I am black.

I am the smoke king,\
I am black.\
      I am cursing ruddy morn,\
      I am hearsing hearts unborn;\
      Souls unto me are as mists in the night,\
      I whiten my black men, I blacken my white,\
      What's the hue of a hide to a man in his might!\
Hail, then, gritty, grimy hands,\
Sweet Christ, pity toiling lands!\
Hail to the smoke king\
Hail to the black!
