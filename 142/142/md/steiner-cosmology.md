Berlin, May 26, 2004 - GA89\
Translated from the German by Frank Thomas Smith

*This is the first of three lectures given in the Berlin branch
of the Theosophical Society in 1904. Rudolf Steiner was the
general secretary of the German Theosophical Society until he
broke with the Theosophists in 1913 and formed the
Anthroposophical Society. This lecture was published in German
by the Rudolf Steiner Verlag, Dornach, Switzerland, in 2001. It
is based on notes taken by listeners and was not revised by the
lecturer*


The lecture cycle on the basic elements of Theosophy that I
recently announced will have to be given later at a more
appropriate time. I have postponed those lectures and decided
for now to dedicate Thursdays to the subject of cosmology, the
evolution of the world, that is, the teaching about the
inception of the world and the shaping of the human being within
this world in a theosophical sense.


I am aware that this involves the most difficult chapter of
theosophical teaching, and I can inform you that several of our
branches have decided not to even touch upon this chapter
because it is too difficult. Nevertheless, I have decided to do
so, because I believe that the indications I am able to give may
be useful to many of you. Even though we cannot cover the
subject completely at once, we can nevertheless receive
indications that will serve to allow us to penetrate more deeply
into the material later. 

Those of you who have been involved in the theosophical
movement for a long time will know that these questions -- How
did the world begin? How did it evolve to the point were human
beings can inhabit it? -- are the first ones taken up in the
theosophical movement. Not only one of the first books that
brought the attention of the west to the ancient world view,
"Isis Unveiled" by H. P. Blavatsky, treated the questions about
the beginning and evolution of the world, but also the book to
which we owe the majority of our oldest followers, "Esoteric
Buddhism", by Sinnet. How does a solar system form? How did the
planets and the star groups come into existence? How did our
Earth develop? What stages did it go through and which ones
still stand before it? These questions are dealt with in depth
in "Esoteric Buddhism". Then at the end of the 1880s Blavatsky's
"The Secret Doctrine" appeared, and in the first volume it deals
with the question: How did the world system evolve? -- and in
the second volume: How did the human race evolve on
Earth? 

I only need to point to one thing in order to show the
difficulties involved. When you open the first volume of
Blavatsky's "Secret Doctrine", you find that certain assertions
in Sinnet's "Buddhism" are described as erroneous and are
partially corrected. The theosophical writers misunderstood some
of these things and some of them were incorrectly described.
Therefore Mrs. Blavatsky corrected them. She said that a kind of
Babylonian speech confusion occurred and that the leading
personalities of the Theosophical Society were not really
knowledgeable concerning these questions. You all know that
exalted masters who are far beyond our average development
imparted the teachings in "The Secret Doctrine". Already before
the "Secret Doctrine" a book appeared in which Sinnet, the
author of "Esoteric Buddhism", published a series of letters
from a Mahatma. We see from this the difficulties in
understanding this secret doctrine, and we understand how Sinnet
and Blavatsky, so diligent in receiving this teaching, were
downright desperate at the difficulty in understanding it.
\"Oh\", one of the teachers said, \"you are accustomed to grasp
things with a different intellect and so cannot understand what
we have to say even though you make a great effort to do so\".
If we consider this statement, the difficulty becomes apparent.
Misunderstandings arise everywhere that cosmology is taught.
Having explained all that, I ask your indulgence if I now try to
contribute something about this teaching.


I would like to begin by clarifying the position of
theosophical cosmology in relation to modern science and its
methods. Some could say: look at the advances our astronomers
have made; we can attribute that to the telescopes, the
mathematical and photographic methods that have given us
knowledge of distant stars. Present day science with its
thorough methods seems -- in their opinion -- to be the only
reliable source of knowledge about the evolution of the world
system. They feel they have the right to ridicule whatever is
said from the other side concerning this subject. Many an
astronomer will object: What you theosophists tell us about
astronomy is ancient wisdom that the Chaldeans or Veden priests
taught and that belongs to the oldest stores of wisdom that
humanity possesses; but what meaning can what was said thousands
of years ago have when it is only since Copernicus that
astronomy has acquired a relatively firm basis. Therefore, what
Blavatsky says in "The Secret Doctrine" seems only to contradict
what our telescopes and so forth make clear to us astronomers.
But the theosophist does not need to contradict what the
astronomer claims. It isn't necessary, although there are
theosophists who think they must fight against present day
astronomy in order to make room for their own teaching. I know
very well that the leaders of the theosophical movement think
they can instruct astronomers. I would like to illustrate the
theosophists correct attitude in respect to astronomers
with one simple example. 

Take a poet whose work gives us pleasure. This poet may find a
biographer who will try to explain the inner spiritual aspects
of the poet's being. There is, however, another possibility --
the physiological, the scientific way. Let's say that a natural
scientist studies the poet. He will only take into consideration
the poet's physiological and physiognomic characteristics; he
studies him from the natural scientific point of view, and will
tell us what he can see and combine with a natural scientific
understanding. We as theosophists would say that this
investigator describes the poet from the standpoint of the
physical plane. He won't say a word about what we call the
poet's biography -- the soul-spiritual aspect. So we would have
two coexisting ways of describing the poet, which do not need to
contradict each other at all. Why shouldn't the natural
scientific and the soul-spiritual coexist and each be relevant
in its own way? One doesn't have to contradict the
other. 

It is the same with natural scientific cosmology, with what our
astronomers tell us about the structure of the world and the
evolution of the world system. They will say what their physical
senses reveal to them. Alongside this, however, the
soul-spiritual way of looking at things is possible, and when we
look at it this way, we will never collide with astronomy; on
the contrary, both ways of thinking will sometimes support each
other. When, for example, scientific brain physiology was far
less advanced than it is now, there were authors who wrote
biographies of important people. The astronomer cannot therefore
object that that the esoteric way of thinking is antiquated and
impossible just because Copernicus gave astronomy a new basis.
The esoteric sources are completely different; they existed long
before the eye learned to observe the heavens through telescopes
and before the stars could be photographed. Copernican and
esoteric research have quite different things to say; and the
force of the one in the human soul is not dependent on the
other. The force that gives us information about the
soul-spiritual aspects goes so far back that no historian can
tell us when this way of describing the world structure began.
It is not possible to discover how the spiritual leaders came
upon these esoteric views.


Esoteric schools existed in Europe before the founding of the
Theosophical Society in 1875. The knowledge was only
disseminated in small circles, however. A strict rule stated
that the knowledge was not to pass beyond the walls of the
schools. If someone wanted to enter a school, he had to work
hard on himself before the first truths were communicated to
him. It was held that a person had to make himself ready before
receiving these truths. There were many degrees in the schools
through which one had to pass -- trial grades; and whoever was
considered not ready had to prepare himself further. If I
described those degrees to you, the strictness of the trials
would make you dizzy. The things about the evolution of the
world were considered to be the most important and were
communicated only to those who had reached the highest degrees.
During the 17th century, which had a great influence on culture,
this knowledge was in the hands of the Rosenkreuz (Rose Cross)
movement, which was originally based on oriental knowledge, and
this knowledge was passed on to the European adepts in the
various degrees. At the end of the 18th century and especially
at the beginning of the 19th century, these esoteric schools
disappeared from the European cultural scene and the last
Rosenkreuz adepts withdrew to the Orient. It was the era in
which men were to organize life according to external knowledge;
the invention of the steam engine, scientific research into cell
biology and so on came about. Esoteric wisdom had nothing to
contribute then and those who had reached the highest points of
this wisdom, the highest grades, withdrew to the Orient.
Although there were esoteric schools later on, they do not
interest us much now; but I must mention them because Mrs.
Blavatsky and Mr. Sinnet, when they received cosmological
knowledge from the Tibet-Buddhist esoteric schools, went to the
basic sources. 

A long spiritual development in Europe had brought the European
brain, the European thinking ability, to such a point that
difficulties arose for the understanding of esoteric truths.
These truths were understood only through great exertion. When
this knowledge was first made public partly by "Esoteric
Buddhism", partly by "The Secret Doctrine", the followers of the
esoteric schools took notice, and it seemed to them a mistake
that the strict rule not to let anything go beyond the walls of
the schools had been broken. The followers of the theosophical
movement knew, however, that it was necessary to make some of
these things known. Western science could not accept what they
said because no one was able to prove what Mrs. Blavatsky and
Sinnet had written. Especially puzzling was the beautiful
cosmological song that comes from the so-called Dzyan
verses[^1], which
introduce both volumes of Madame Blavatsky's book. The
authenticity of these verses, which relate the history of the
universe, was challenged; no scientific investigator could make
anything of them; it all seemed a slap in the face of everything
European scholars knew. There was one researcher, an orientalist
named Max
Müller[^2], whom I
greatly respect, who energetically stood up for oriental wisdom.
Everything he was able to learn about oriental wisdom he made
available to Europe. But neither Max Müller nor any other
scientist could do anything with what Madame Blavatsky
proclaimed. They all said that the contents of "The Secret
Doctrine" were pure fantasy. The scholars had never found
anything like it in Indian documents. 

Madame Blavatsky said that the place where she had obtained her
secrets still contained great treasures of ancient literature,
but that the most important parts of this wisdom had been kept
protected from western eyes. Even the little that was revealed
wasn't understood because of the European way of thinking; the
commentary that contained the key to understanding was lacking.
The books that showed how the individual propositions were to be
understood were carefully hidden by the native Tibetan
instructors -- at least that's what Madame Blavatsky said. But
other thinkers claimed that this literature testifies that an
ancient wisdom existed that went far beyond anything the world
knows about spiritual matters today. The oriental wise men say
that ancient wisdom is contained in those books, which they have
carefully protected, and that this ancient wisdom has not been
handed down by people like us, but they derive from higher
beings, that they derive from divine sources. The Orientals
speak of a divine ancient wisdom. But Max Müller said in a
lecture to his students that it is not possible to verify that
such an ancient wisdom exited. When a great Brahmin Sanskrit
scholar heard about this from Mrs. Blavatsky, he said: Oh, if
only Max Müller were a Brahmin and I could take him to a temple;
I could convince him there that a divine wisdom
exists.

The things that Blavatsky revealed through the Dzyan verses are
in part from such hidden sources. If Mrs. Blavatsky had invented
these verses by herself we would be facing an even greater
wonder.  

We are not obliged, however, to take the esoteric messages
about the origin of the world from the old writings. There are
forces in man that enable him to observe and investigate the
truths himself, when he develops these forces in the right way.
And what one can experience in this way agrees with what Mrs.
Blavatsky brought from the Far East. It turns out that the
occultists in Europe also protected knowledge that the teacher
passed on from generation to generation without ever entrusting
it to books. The occultists could therefore assess what
Blavatsky indicated in "The Secret Doctrine" according to their
own knowledge, especially what they had acquired through their
own capabilities. It was tested and
confirmed[^3], but
it is nevertheless difficult for the European occultist to come
to terms with it. I will just mention one point: European
esoteric knowledge is in a very definite way determined by
Christian and Cabbalistic influences and has therefore taken on
a one-sided character. If we take this into consideration
though, and go back to the basis of this knowledge, full
agreement with what has been revealed through Mrs. Blavatsky is
possible.  

Although a kind of verification of what Mrs. Blavatsky told us
about cosmology was possible, it is difficult to make the
scholars understand what is meant when the origin of the world
is spoken of based of esoteric knowledge. It is of course
amazing what the scholars have accomplished in deciphering the
old documents, how they struggle to decipher the Babylonian
cuneiform characters and the Egyptian hieroglyphics; but Max
Müller said that these inscriptions give no indication about the
origin of the world. We see how the scholars work around the
edge of things and don't get to the core. I am not criticizing
the great care and the exact mosaic work the scholars have
performed. I will only point to the books that have appeared
concerning the Bible-Babel
arguments[^4]. That
is all fine mosaic work, but the scholars are stuck at the
periphery. One feels that they have no idea of how to arrive at
the key to these mysteries. It is like when one begins to
translate a book written in a foreign language. At first it is
imperfect. It's the same with the
translations of the old creation myths by our scholars. These
are mutilations of the ancient teachings that were handed down
from generation to generation. Only those who reached a certain
degree of initiation could know something about them. At the end
of these lectures I will come back to this.


Initiates are those who have attained knowledge of these things
through their own experience. You may ask: what is an initiate
anyway? In Theosophy and in the esoteric societies so much is
said about so-called initiates. An initiate is one who has
developed to a high degree the force that slumbers in every
person -- and which can be developed by every person. The
initiate has cultivated these forces and adapted them to the
point that he can understand what kind of forces in the universe
are the subjects of what I want to explain. Well, you will say:
we are always told that such occult forces exist which slumber
in men, but that doesn't make it certain. That is the result of
a misunderstanding. The mystic, the occultist, does not assert
anything that a scholar cannot assert in his field. Let's say
that someone tells you a mathematical truth. If you haven't
studied mathematics you don't have the necessary knowledge to
verify this truth. No one will deny that to judge a mathematical
truth the necessary capacities must be attained first. No
authority can decide about such a truth, only the individual who
has experienced it can judge. And only someone who has
experienced an esoteric truth can judge it. Our contemporaries,
however, demand that the occultist prove what he says to the
satisfaction of every average intelligence. They stand by the
sentence: what is true must be provable and everyone must be
able to understand it. The occultist, however, asserts nothing
else than what any other scholar asserts in his own field, and
he demands nothing more than every mathematician also
demands.


You could ask: why are occult truths reported today? The
previous method used by the esoteric schools was to keep them in
small groups. This method is still used by the occultists of the
"right". Whoever has experience and can read the signs of the
times, however, knows that this is no longer correct. And the
fact that it is no longer correct is the reason for the origin
of the theosophical world movement. What is most developed in
our times is understanding. We thank the advances in industry
and technology to our combining thinking with the senses. This
understanding, or intellectualism, celebrated its greatest
triumphs in the 19th century.
Intellectual thinking has never been
so strongly developed as it is today. I said that the oriental
wise men possessed an ancient wisdom, but it was in a completely
different form than that of today's thinking. The great teachers
of the Orient did not have this cleverness of logical thinking,
this pure logic; they didn't need it. Therefore it was difficult
to understand them. They had intuition, inner vision. True
intuition is not acquired through logical thinking; rather a
truth appears directly before the spirit of the person
concerned. He *knows* it. It
doesn't need to be proven to him. 


The Teachers of the theosophical movement now have the right to
impart a certain part of this esoteric wisdom. We have the right
to clothe in the modern form of thinking the wisdom that has
been imparted to us in the form of intuition. Thought is a force
like electricity, like steam power, like the power of heat. And
whoever receives the thoughts that are taught within the
theosophical movement and devotes himself to them without being
mistrustful from the start, in him these thought are a force.
The listeners don't realize it at first; the seed begins to grow
later. No theosophical teacher asks anything more than to be
heard. He doesn't demand blind faith, only listening. Neither
believing acceptance nor unbelieving rejection are correct
standpoints. The listener should only consider the thoughts
conveyed to him, free from belief or doubt, free from Yes or No.
He must be "neutral" and allow the teachings to work "on
probation". Whoever does this has not only thoughts flowing into
him, but also a spiritual power that acts.


People find the easiest access through thinking because Western
European culture has developed this capacity to such an extent.
Even the most faithful church-going Christians cannot imagine to
what extent people believed earlier. This source of conviction
no longer flows. Today we must fructify our thought in a
completely different way. In the past spiritual communications
had to be imparted in secret esoteric schools because thinking
was not cultivated as it is today. Today we must combine
spirituality with the force of thinking, by which we kindle the
thoughts so they live. The spiritual speaker speaks in a
different way to his listeners than does a common speaker. He
speaks so that a kind of spiritual fluid, a spiritual force
flows from him. The listener should be objective, without a Yes
or No; he should live with this thought, meditate on it and let
it work in him. Then a force will be lighted in
him. 

Today we must announce esoteric truths about the origin and
evolution of the world in the form of European thinking and
science. These lectures will describe in this way
the conditions that preceded the
formation of our earth. We will be led back to the most ancient
times where, in the grayest light of dawn, those beings formed
who later developed into human beings. We will be led to the
stage where this human being was imbued with earthly forces,
were he was surrounded by earthly matter, to the point were he
now stands. We will learn and see the pre-earthly and earthly
evolution of our world, and how Theosophy gives us an outlook
into the future. We will see where the evolution of the world is
going. We want to show all that without opposing the ideas of
today's astronomers. If we develop the forces that slumber in
us, we will see for ourselves the great goal to which we are
heading: the acquisition of cosmological wisdom. We will
consider this cosmological wisdom in the next lectures.
