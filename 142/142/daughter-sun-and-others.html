<h1>Chess and Cheese in Crete</h1>
<h2>by Frank Thomas Smith</h2>
<p><img src="lovers-crete.jpg" class="a" /></p>
<div>
	<p class="intropoem">To sit outdoors in Crete<br />
with you and coffee, hardtoast,<br />
creamy butter and yoghurt<br />
after a morning swim<br />
<span style="margin-left:3rem">in the rosy-fingered dawn...</span></p>
<p>And for lunch at the bubbling port<br />
unidentifiable sea-things,<br />
lukewarm vegetables, cheese,<br />
the deceptive yellow wine<br />
<span style="margin-left:3rem">churning my burning blood,</span></p>
<p>In our room on the creaky bed<br />
with the shutters open wide,<br />
a window on the sea,<br />
your hard nipple swelling,<br />
<span style="margin-left:3rem">contemplating it I...</span></p>
<p><em>One day a thoughtful Arab,</em><br />
<em>on folding up his tent</em><br />
<em>under the desert stars,</em><br />
<em>touched by the God of chess</em><br />
<span style="margin-left:3rem"><em>invented and played the game</em>.</span></p>
<p>I ask (silently, my love)<br />
how far we are from that country,<br />
and do we care, now,<br />
as I penetrate your darkness<br />
<span style="margin-left:3rem">and mate your castled queen.</span></p>
</div>
<h1>The Daughter of the Sun</h1>
<p><img src="goddess.jpg" class="a" /></p>
<div>
<p class="intropoem">The Daughter of the Sun<br />
Taught us all we know,<br />
First she forged the flicking fire,<br />
The greatest gift of all,<br />
And showed us how to forge it<br />
Evermore.<br />
The stone ax to chop and cut and kill,<br />
Baskets woven of high dry grass,<br />
Pots scooped from earth and kilned in fire<br />
She gave us:<br />
The Daughter of the Sun<br />
Taught us all we know.</p>
<p>One day she cooked a soup of river fish.<br />
The flames roared and the pot flowed over,<br />
And soup and fish doused the fire.<br />
The Daughter of the Sun,<br />
Angered by the fire's frivolousness,<br />
Squatted over the embers and pissed a lake.<br />
The fire's dying embers singed her pubic hair,<br />
The burnt vaginal odor engulfed the world,<br />
Kindling desire for woman in us all.</p>
<p>Returning, spent, to the over-world<br />
She taught us how to die, but not the why.<br />
O Daughter of the Sun,<br />
O Mother of the Moon.</p>
</div>
<h1>The Expatriate</h1>
<p><img src="lady-breast.jpg" class="a" /></p>
<div>
<p class="intropoem">The problem with most foreign lands<br />
is that they're far, too far away,<br />
like the bleachers in Ebbett's used to be<br />
before the debacle of technology.<br />
Also, either they're terribly bland,<br />
foggy, windy and damp, or,<br />
if southerly, downright dangerous,<br />
where bullets fly and sunscreen 21<br />
can't ward off the assassin sun.</p>
<p>Why, then, does he dwell,<br />
ducking and frying, far from the patria<br />
he tearfully invokes over juice of the grape<br />
at a sidewalk table of the corner taberna?<br />
Call it if you will, with a shrug, "escape".<br />
He'll smile and wave away a bug<br />
or give his drooping mustache a tug,<br />
or frown his glabrous suntanned brow.<br />
"Could be," he mutters, "but who cares now?"</p>
<p>He'll bid goodbye to you and,<br />
sandal-clad as once Ulysses,<br />
his uncashed pension check<br />
snug against his bony chest,<br />
walk along the winding lane<br />
home to his dark-tress'd mistress<br />
who waits with kisses and a wanton caress.</p>
<p>Foreign lands are far away,<br />
it's true, but so is the expatriate.</p>
</div>
<h1>The Promise</h1>
<p><img src="full-moon.jpg" class="a" /></p>
<div style="font-style:italic">
<p class="intropoem">Hey Dad, I'll be there soon,<br />
Sometime before the next full moon;</p>
<p>Until then don't you weep,<br />
I'll be home before you sleep.</p>
