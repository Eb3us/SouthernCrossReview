<h3>A Tale of Two Elizabeths, One Joe, One Donald, and Us</h3>
<p>Britons mourned the recent passing of Queen Elizabeth II, and
understandably so. The outpouring of affection for their long-serving
monarch was more than commendable, it was touching. Yet count me among
those mystified that so many Americans also professed to care. With all
due respect to Queen Latifah, we decided way back in 1776 that we’d had
our fill of royalty.</p>
<p>Mere weeks after the death of Elizabeth II came the demise of another
Elizabeth, better known as Liz, whose tenure as British prime minister
<a
href="https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/10/20/liz-truss-is-britains-shortest-serving-prime-minister">shattered</a>
all previous records for brevity. Forty-four days after Her Majesty had
asked her to form a government, Liz Truss announced her decision to step
down. Cries of “No, Liz, stay on!” were muted indeed, while she herself
seemed to feel a sense of relief that her moment at the pinnacle of
British politics had ended so swiftly.</p>
<p><span id="anchor"></span>As a general rule, I no more care who
resides at 10 Downing Street than who lives in Buckingham Palace, since
neither bears more than the most marginal relevance to the well-being of
the United States. Even so, I confess that I found the made-for-tabloids
tale of Truss’s rise and fall riveting — not a Shakespearean tragedy
perhaps but a compelling dramedy offering raw material — most memorably
in the <a
href="https://www.telegraphindia.com/world/british-prime-minister-liz-trusss-greatest-legacy-jokes-jokes-and-more-jokes/cid/1893266">form
of lettuce</a> — sufficient to supply stand-up comics the world
over.</p>
<p>That Truss was manifestly unsuited to serve as prime minister should
count as the understatement of the month. Her perpetually wide-eyed look
seemingly expressed her own amazement at having high office thrust upon
her and gave the game away. Along with the entire Tory party leadership,
she was, it seemed, in on the caper — a huge joke at the expense of the
British people.</p>
<p>Here was so-called liberal democracy in action. And not just any
democracy, mind you, but an ancient and hallowed one. In American
political circles, the notion persists that our own system of government
somehow derives from that of Great Britain, that despite the many
historical and substantive differences between the way Washington and
Westminster work, we both share the same political space.</p>
<p>We and they are exemplars, models of popular government for the rest
of the world. We and they stand arm-in-arm against autocrats and
authoritarians. The legitimacy of the British democratic system affirms
the legitimacy of our own. To others around the world aspiring to
liberty, it proclaims: This is how it’s done. Now, go and do
likewise.</p>
<p>In this particular instance, passing the torch in that ostensibly
great democracy occurred in a matter of days. Notably, however, the
British people played no part whatsoever in deciding who should succeed
Truss. Of course, neither had they played any role in installing her as
prime minister in the first place. Roughly <a
href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/sn05125/">172,000
dues-paying members</a> of the Conservative Party had made that decision
on their behalf. And when her government abruptly imploded, even party
members found themselves consigned to the role of spectators. In a
nation of some <a
href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/elections/electoralregistration/bulletins/electoralstatisticsforuk/december2021">46
million registered voters</a>, a grand total of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)">357
Conservative members of parliament</a> decided who would form the next
government — the equivalent of the Democratic caucus in the House of
Representatives deciding it had had enough of Joe Biden and choosing his
successor.</p>
<p>British Conservatives dismissed out of hand suggestions that a
general election might be in order, that ordinary Britons should have
some say in who would govern them. They did so for the most
understandable of reasons: <a
href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/21/uk/uk-no-election-explained-intl-gbr/index.html">opinion
polls</a> indicated that in any election the Tory party would suffer
catastrophic losses. It turns out that, in the hierarchy of values to
which members of Parliament adhere, self-preservation ranks first.
Students of American politics should not find that surprising.</p>
<p>To be clear, all of this falls completely within the rules of the
game. Were the situation reversed, Britain’s Labour Party would surely
have done likewise.</p>
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1642598348/ref=nosim/?tag=tomdispatch-20">

<p>In the United Kingdom, this is how democracy works. “The People” play
the role allotted to them. That role expands or contracts to suit the
convenience of those who actually call the shots. In practice, liberal
democracy thereby becomes a euphemism for cynical manipulation. While
the results may entertain, as the saga of Liz Truss surely did, they
offer little to admire or emulate.</p>
<p>The entire spectacle should, however, give Americans food for
thought. If extreme partisanship, greed, and hunger for power displace
any recognizable conception of the common good, this is where we’re
liable to end up.</p>
<p><strong><em>Charles to the Rescue</em></strong></p>
<p>But give the Brits this: when faced with a crisis at the heart of
their politics, their politicians dealt with it expeditiously, even
ruthlessly. In announcing economic policies to which their financial
markets objected, Truss had seemingly forgotten whom she was actually
working for. Because of that, she was promptly sacked and then just as
quickly dispatched to the political wilderness.</p>
<p>Credit the sovereign with saving the day. Advised to invite
Conservative MP Rishi Sunak to form a new government, Charles III did
just that and then returned to Windsor or Balmoral or whichever royal
property he and the queen consort are currently using.</p>
<p>Granted, the action by the new-to-the-job king was purely symbolic.
Yet its importance can hardly be overestimated. Charles affirmed the
legitimacy of what otherwise might have looked suspiciously like a
bloodless coup engineered by panicky MPs less interested in governance
than saving their own skins. He thereby more than earned his generous
paycheck, just as <a
href="https://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/king-charles-iii-to-inherit-38-billion-fortune-232222293.html">his
mother had</a> over the course of seven decades when inviting pols of
varying distinction to form governments.</p>
<p>Of course, little of this has anything to do with democratic practice
per se. After all, no one elected Charles king, just as no one had
elected his mum queen. And while Charles inherits the title “Defender of
the Faith,” no one has ever looked to a British monarch to serve as a
“Defender of Democracy.” The role of the monarch is to sustain a
political order that keeps at bay the forces of anarchy, thereby
enabling some version of representative government, however flawed, to
survive.</p>
<p>By that measure, Britons have good cause to proclaim, “God Save the
King.”</p>
<p><strong><em>Still Legit?</em></strong></p>
<p>All of which should invite us Americans to consider this
long-taken-for-granted question: When it comes to the legitimacy of our
own political system, how are we doing? Given the startling
proliferation of illiberal and antidemocratic tendencies in the American
polity, how should we rate the health of our own liberal democracy?
Indeed, does the phrase “liberal democracy” even accurately describe
what goes on in Washington and in several dozen state capitals?</p>
<p>That such a question has acquired genuine urgency speaks volumes
about American politics in our time. Nor does that urgency derive
entirely – perhaps not even primarily — from the malignant presence of
Donald Trump on the national scene, regardless of what panicky reporting
in mainstream media outlets may suggest.</p>
<p>On all matters related to Trump, our fellow citizens — those who are
sentient anyway — tend to fall into two camps. In one are those who see
the former president as a transformational figure, whether for good
(Make America Great Again) or ill (paving the way for fascism). In the
other are those who view him less as cause than effect, his lingering
prominence stemming from pathologies he’s skillfully exploited but had
little role in creating.</p>
<p>I happen to inhabit that second camp. I loathe Donald Trump. But I
fear a political, intellectual, and cultural elite that appears
incapable of responding effectively to the crisis presently engulfing
the United States.</p>
<p>Innumerable writers (<a
href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250175083/theageofillusions">including
me</a>) have attempted to lay out the origins and scope of that crisis
and propose antidotes. None in my estimation (myself again included)
have fully succeeded. Or at least none have persuaded Americans as to
the true source of our collective malaise and discontent.</p>
<p>The resulting void explains the inclination to view Trump as the root
cause of the nation’s troubles — or alternatively as our last best hope
of salvation. Yet despite the palpable hunger in some quarters to
imagine him locked up and in others to return him to the White House,
Trump is neither a demon nor a wizard. He is instead a physical
manifestation of the collective fears and fantasies to which Americans
of all political persuasions have in recent years become
susceptible.</p>
<p>Should Trump regain the presidency in 2024 — admittedly, a dreadful
prospect — the crisis gripping our country would undoubtedly deepen. But
were a benign storm to sweep the Master of Mar-a-Lago into the vast
ocean depths never to be seen again, that crisis would persist.</p>
<p>Factors contributing to that crisis are not difficult to identify.
They include:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <a

<li>the <a

<li>a waning public confidence in the <a

of the courts</a>;</li>
<li>a “way of life” centered on <a

deterioration of our world;</li>
<li>freedom defined as <a

stoked by resentments related to race and class;</li>
<li>the invasively corrosive, ever-expanding <a
href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/negative-effects-social-media/">impact</a>
of social media;</li>
<li>deep-seated disputes centering on the <a
href="https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2018/january-web-only/religious-conflict-at-heart-of-our-culture-wars.html">role
of religion</a> in American life;</li>
<li>a mindless penchant for <a
href="https://mronline.org/2022/09/16/u-s-launched-251-military-interventions-since-1991-and-469-since-1798/">military
activism</a> sustained by willful amnesia about war’s actual costs and
consequences;</li>
<li>a refusal to acknowledge that the era of <a
href="https://www.institutmontaigne.org/en/analysis/fall-american-primacy">American
global primacy</a> is ending;</li>
<li>and last (but by no means least), a <a
href="https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=13666&amp;context=journal_articles">loss
of faith</a> in the Constitution as the essential cornerstone of our
political order.</li>
</ul>
<p>Collectively, these add up to a Bigger Truth that easily eclipses in
importance the Big Lie that presently dominates so much of American
political discourse. While obsessing over the <a
href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/16/politics/trump-big-lie-gop-election">false
claim</a> that Trump won reelection in 2020 may be understandable, it
diverts attention from the real meaning of that Bigger Truth, namely
that <strong>liberal democracy</strong> no longer describes the
bizarrely elaborate, increasingly disfunctional system of governance
that prevails in the United States.</p>
<p>Reducing the existing system to a single phrase is a daunting
proposition. It is <strong>sui generis</strong>, mixing myth, greed,
rank dishonesty, and a refusal to face the music. But this much is for
sure: It’s anything but governance by elected representatives chosen by
an informed electorate who deliberate and decide in the interests of the
American people as a whole.</p>
<p><strong><em>Siri, Where Are We?</em></strong></p>
<p>In my estimation, Joe Biden is a man of goodwill but limited
abilities. In ousting Donald Trump from the White House, he performed a
vitally important service to the nation. But President Biden is not just
very old. His entire outlook is as stale as a week-old bagel.</p>
<p>Biden clearly believes that he has a firm grasp on what our times
require. He regularly insists that we have arrived at an “inflection
point.” Drawing on the familiar narrative of the twentieth century, he
believes that he has deciphered the meaning of that inflection point.
His interpretation, shared by many others among the current crop of the
Best and Brightest, centers on a conviction that a global competition
between freedom and unfreedom, democracy and autocracy defines the
overarching challenge of our time. It’s us against them — the United
States (with accommodating allies holding Uncle Sam’s coat) pitted
against China and Russia, the outcome of this competition guaranteed to
determine the fate of humankind.</p>
<p>Forty years ago, dealing with the array of concerns that defined the
late Cold War era — avoiding World War III, outcompeting the Soviets,
and keeping the gas pumps from running dry — Biden might have been an
effective president. Today, he’s as clueless as Liz Truss self-evidently
was, spouting bromides and advocating for programs left over from the
heyday of American liberalism.</p>
<p>As Biden stumbles wearily from one verbal gaffe to the next, he
embodies the exhaustion of that earlier political era. If reinvigorating
the American political order defines the urgent calling of our present
moment, he hasn’t the least idea where to begin.</p>
<p>At the risk of violating the prevailing canons of political
correctness, let me suggest that we turn for counsel to Russia. No, not
Vladimir Putin, but Leo Tolstoy. In the conclusion to his novel
<strong>War and Peace,</strong> Tolstoy wrote that “modern history, like
a deaf man, answers questions no one has asked.” That pithy observation
captures the essence of our own predicament: It’s the questions that go
unasked that are likely to do us in.</p>
<p>Consider, for example, these: What if the vaunted “American way of
life” doesn’t define the destiny of humankind? What if true freedom
means something different than the conception promoted in Washington or
New York, Hollywood or Silicon Valley? What if Biden’s inflection point
— should it exist — doesn’t come with a Made-in-the-U.S.A. label?</p>
<p>The first step toward enlightenment is to ask the right questions.
Joe Biden and the American political establishment seem remarkably blind
to the need to do just that. So are the tens of millions of Americans,
whether angry or simply baffled, who vainly stare at their smartphones
in search of answers or who look at the results of the midterm elections
and ask: Is that the best we can do?</p>
<p>As a nation, we are adrift in uncharted waters — and we can’t look to
King Charles to save us.</p>
