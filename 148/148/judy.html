<p>Somewhere over the Rainbow</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"As for my feelings toward 'Over the Rainbow,' it's become part of my
life. It is so symbolic of all my dreams and wishes that I'm sure that's
why people sometimes get tears in their eyes when they hear me sing
it."</p>

<p>Judy Garland</p>

<p><strong>Judy Garland</strong> (born Frances Ethel Gumm; June 10,
1922 – June 22, 1969) was an American actress and singer. While
critically acclaimed for many different roles throughout her career, she
is widely known for playing the part of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_Gale">Dorothy</a>in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wizard_of_Oz_(1939_film)"><em>The
Wizard of Oz</em></a> (1939) She attained international stardom as an
actress in both musical and dramatic roles, as a recording artist and on
the concert stage.</p>
<p>Garland began performing as a child with her two older sisters, in
a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaudeville">vaudeville</a> group "<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judy_Garland#The_Gumm/Garland_Sisters">The
Gumm Sisters</a>" and was later signed to <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer">Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer</a> as
a teenager. She appeared in more than two dozen films for MGM. Garland
was a frequent on-screen partner of both <a

Kelly</a> and regularly collaborated with director and second husband <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincente_Minnelli">Vincente
Minnelli</a>. Other starring roles during this period included <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meet_Me_in_St._Louis"><em>Meet Me in
St. Louis</em></a> (1944), <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Harvey_Girls"><em>The Harvey
Girls</em></a> (1946), <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Parade_(film)"><em>Easter
Parade</em></a> (1948) and <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Stock"><em>Summer
Stock</em></a> (1950). In 1950, after 15 years with MGM, the studio
released her amid a series of personal struggles that prevented her from
fulfilling the terms of her contract.</p>
<p>Although her film career became intermittent thereafter, two of
Garland's most critically acclaimed roles came later in her career: she
received a nomination for the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actress">Academy
Award for Best Actress</a> for her performance in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Star_Is_Born_(1954_film)"><em>A
Star Is Born</em></a> (1954) and a nomination for <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Supporting_Actress">Best
Supporting Actress</a> for her performance in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judgment_at_Nuremberg"><em>Judgment
at Nuremberg</em></a> (1961). She also made record-breaking concert
appearances, released <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judy_Garland_discography#Studio_albums">eight
studio albums</a> and hosted her own <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primetime_Emmy_Award">Emmy</a>-nominated
television series, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Judy_Garland_Show"><em>The Judy
Garland Show</em></a> (1963–1964).</p>
<p>She struggled in her personal life from an early age. The pressures
of early stardom affected her physical and mental health from the time
she was a teenager; her self-image was influenced by constant criticism
from film executives who believed that she was physically unattractive
and who manipulated her onscreen physical appearance. Throughout her
adulthood she was plagued by alcohol and substance abuse, as well as
financial instability. Her lifelong <a

use disorder</a> ultimately led to her death from an accidental <a

overdose</a> in 1969, at age 47.</p>
<p>That's from Wikipedia. I saw Judy perform at the Palace theater in
New York when I was nineteen years old, just before leaving for U.S.
Army basic training. It was during the Korean War. I was already in love
with her, (although I went to the Palace with a girlfriend) probably
because of <em>The Wizard of Oz </em>(1938) and other films. She was
sensational, possessed of a charisma impossible to describe. The
audience was devastated, when she finished and ran off there was
absolute silence...until the standing ovation began and never ended.</p>
<p>Here are links to her singing <em>Somewhere Over the Rainbow</em> in
The wizard of Oz and in 1951 at the Palace:</p>
