<p class="intro">I was sitting on the veranda, the winter sun high enough to warm me.
I closed the book I was reading – a kindle edition of Stephen King's The
Green Mile – and looked into the small forest which began about thirty
yards from where I was sitting. I saw, or thought I saw, a face there
within the green. It was unclear, unfocused, so to speak. A cloud-like
formation crept from the east to cover it, but then dissipated. I tried
to determine who it was, but could not. I thought of Jesus, whom I had
had occasion to meet some years ago in a dream when I lived in Geneva. I
wrote it down in my “dream book”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>May 15, 1985 - <em>I was with John Rogan in a park. We were walking
away from a lake when a voice called to us. “You there of the same
race.” We turned and saw a man with a light-colored beard and a woman
walking together on the lake. They were smiling and walking toward us on
the water. We stated to tingle all over and felt weak with joy. John
went down on one knee. I just stood there. I wonderful feeling of
recognition coursed through me – and thankfulness. Yes, this is it, oh
my God! But they stopped before reaching us. It was too much perhaps.
The woman said, I think to John, “You would like us to continue, I know,
but ...” I woke up. It was Christ. The woman, I don't know. Maybe they
were both Christ, different aspects of him [or Mary Magdalene]. They
were dressed in normal, casual modern clothes.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>John Rogan was a friend and colleague from when we worked together
for American Airlines in LaGuardia airport in New York City. When we
worked the night shift we usually went to a nearby bar afterward for a
couple of beers to unwind. Paul Gibson – another friend and colleague,
accompanied us. One night several months after Paul had quit and
returned home to a small town upstate new York – the big apple wasn't
for him, or for his wife, Anna – John and I were working late when a
call came for him at the ticket counter, It was Anna: Paul had died
suddenly from encephalitis and she wanted us, John and me, to be pall
bearers at his funeral in a few days. John waved me over, covered the
phone's mouthpiece and told me what Anna had said. I nodded and he told
Anna that we'd be there. I walked back to the passenger I'd abandoned
while John wrote down the instructions about how to get there. John and
Paul were around my age, 27.</p>
<p>I hadn't seen or had contact with John in over 25 years. So was that
face I thought I saw (without John) watching me now from the forest
Jesus again, or someone else? It was hazy enough to be either male or
female. But if it was Jesus of Nazareth it would have been inconsistent,
not to mention ungentlemanly, to appear to me without Mary of
Magdala.</p>
<p>The other possibility is that my eyes weren't open at all, that I had
fallen asleep, perchance to dream. I guess there's the rub, but not
necessarily. If Jesus wanted to appear to me it would be easier, more
convenient that is, to appear in a dream than in waking life when I
could have got all excited and started yelling or fainting or calling
the media for an interview.</p>
<p>On the other hand, doesn't Jesus have better things to do than have
tea with me? I can't believe he'd be so disorganized. I used to work as
a management consultant specializing in organization development (OD).
One of my dogmas concerned the need to share responsibility. Jesus is at
least second (well, maybe third) in command of a huge organization
comprising every person who ever lived. Therefore the angels who,
according to those who claim to know, are in charge of influencing
individuals and their karma, are divinely organized to make the best of
an until now chaotic and often cruel human nature. Some Russian once
said that most people are dissatisfied with the suffering of life, but
are afraid of death. That's actually what Hamlet meant, for he was
talking about the dream that is death. Remember that the speech starts
with <em>To be or not to be</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">*</p>
<p>I went back to my chair on the veranda the next day and stared out at
the same place in the <em>bosquecito</em> , but did not see the visitor
again. I closed my eyes in an attempt to determine whether what I'd seen
the day before was seen through a glass (eyelids) darkly. No such luck,
but I was visited by a myriad of other weird stuff, mostly memories of
past mistakes and joyous occasions. If you think I'm talking like a
chump (antiquated word for asshole), I suggest and urgently request that
you stop reading because it's going to get worse.</p>
<p>In the nineteen-twenties Carl Gustav Jung published an essay
entitled <em>The Spiritual Problem of Modern Man</em>. While reading it
and nodding in agreement, I couldn't help thinking that the problem Jung
so eloquently described almost a hundred years ago is not only still
with us, but has become increasingly so.</p>
<p>Jung wrote after the First World War, but saw no hope that it would
really be “the war to end all wars” as prophesied by cynically
optimistic politicians. It is the modern human being who, by the very
fact of being modern and thus looking into his own unconscious
(something he had never done before) is so bereft of meaning that he is
capable of anything and everything. “Psychology”, even a hundred years
ago, had become sufficiently popular to make at least the educated
person wonder what the hell was going on in his own interior, in his own
psyche. The official religions had lost their authority once it became
obvious that they had as little knowledge of what life and death mean as
a Doctor of Philosophy or Charlie Chaplin.</p>
<p>Today the churches with their perverted priests and dogmas, are even
more degenerate than they were then. They disgust rather than inspire.
Even the sincere clerics can do no more than preach about the necessity
of having faith. In what? In what they are told by the interpreters of
the holy writs. So this leaves us forced to face the existential
dilemmas of human life without the helpful crutch of religious
dogma.</p>
<p>Jung: “<em>How totally different did the world appear to medieval
man! For him the earth was eternally fixed and at rest in the center of
the universe…Men were all children of God under the loving care of the
Most High, who prepared them for eternal blessedness; and all knew
exactly what they should do and how they should conduct themselves in
order to rise from a corruptible world to an incorruptible and joyous
existence. Such a life no longer seems real to us, even in our
dreams.”</em></p>
<p>In place of religious dogma, scientific materialism has codified its
own dogma. The Darwinian theory of evolution has certainly become dogma
in its dictionary definition: <em>a principle or set of principles laid
down by an authority as incontrovertibly true.</em></p>
<p>Darwin's theory is correct as far as it goes, but who or what is the
authority that deems it incontrovertibly true? Scientific materialism
itself of course. My only argument is not directed against its
observable facts but the benediction: <em>natural selection</em>: “The
process according to which organisms with favorable traits are more
likely to reproduce. In doing so, they pass on these traits to the next
generation. Over time this process allows organisms to adapt to their
environment.” Therefore <em>Nature</em> selects the favorable traits
likely to reproduce. And who, may I ask, is “Nature”, by definition
capable of considering the advantages of certain traits and deciding
which to infiltrate the next generation. Nobody decides anything, say
the scientists; it's a random process. This dogma is very much with
us.</p>
<p>Then there is the Marxian theory of social development. Here the
motivational principle is again automatic: economic interests defined by
social classes. This theory suffered a blow in 1989 that put it into
intensive therapy: the fall of the Berlin Wall and eventually of the
Soviet Union. Nevertheless, economic growth or lack of it remains the
criterion of our times – whether it takes place in a democratic or
authoritarian political scenario. The human being, lost in this
labyrinth, has lost his individuality and has become a mere abstract
number in the bureau of statistics. He can only play the role of an
interchangeable unit of infinitesimal importance, a speck of matter in a
random cosmos. The effect for many, perhaps for the majority, is that
life has no meaning.</p>
<p>However, Jung saw an increasing interest in psychology, at least
among the western educated classes, and considered it not only positive
but necessary. He meant not only the work of Freud and others, but also
such psychic phenomena as astrology, Theosophy, Anthroposophy and
parapsychology. He compares it to Gnostic thought in the first and
second centuries after Christ.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<em>The spiritual currents of our time have, in fact, a deep
affinity with Gnosticism. […] The most impressive movement numerically
is undoubtedly Theosophy, together with its continental sister,
Anthroposophy; these are pure Gnosticism in Hindu dress. […] What is
striking about these Gnostic systems is that they are based exclusively
on the manifestations of the unconscious.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, yes and no. Rudolf Steiner, the founder of Anthroposophy,
eventually put aside his Hindu dress and donned instead German
philosophical idealism, Christianity and a black bow tie. Luckily
however, he retained his strong belief in reincarnation and karma.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<em>Such movements,“ <em>Jung goes on,</em> ”have a genuinely
religious character, even when they pretend to be scientific. It changes
nothing when Rudolf Steiner calls his Anthroposophy spiritual science,
or when Mrs Eddy invents a Christian Science. […] The fact that all the
movements I have mentioned give themselves a scientific veneer is not
just a grotesque caricature or a masquerade, but a positive sign that
they are actually pursuing 'science', i.e., knowledge instead of faith.
[…] Modern man abhors faith and the religions based upon it. He holds
them valid only as far as their knowledge-content seems to accord with
his own experience of the psychic background, He wants to know – to
experience for himself.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gnosis is Greek for wisdom or knowledge; science is Latin for
knowledge. Anthroposophy is English (and German) for knowledge of man.
It seems that Anthroposophy is closer to Gnosticism than even Rudolf
Steiner realized, not having had access to the Gnostic Gospels and other
documents discovered after his death.</p>
<p>All this doesn't tell me who was looking at me (or not) from the
woods in front of my porch or whether the experience was interior or
exterior. But it at least tells me that I'm not alone and that many
things are happening both inside and outside – or perhaps they are one.
It reminds me of Rudolf Steiner's meditation meant for students of his
Esoteric School, back in 1924, about the time Carl Jung was writing his
essay about <em>The Spiritual Problem of Modern Man</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>O man, know thyself!<br />
So resounds the Cosmic-Word.<br />
You hear it strong in soul,<br />
You feel it firm in spirit.</p>
<p>Who speaks with such cosmic might?<br />
Who speaks with such depth of heart?</p>
<p>Does it work through distant radiant space<br />
Into your senses' sense of being?<br />
Does it ring through weaving waves of time<br />
Into your life's evolving stream?</p>
<p>It's you yourself who,<br />
In feeling space, in experiencing time,</p>
<p>Create the Word, feeling foreign<br />
In the soulless void of space<br />
Because you lose the force of thought<br />
In time's destructive flow.</p>
</blockquote>
