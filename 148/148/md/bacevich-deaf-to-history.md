### A Tale of Two Elizabeths, One Joe, One Donald, and Us

## By [Andrew Bacevich](https://tomdispatch.com/authors/andrewbacevich/)

Britons mourned the recent passing of Queen Elizabeth II, and
understandably so. The outpouring of affection for their long-serving
monarch was more than commendable, it was touching. Yet count me among
those mystified that so many Americans also professed to care. With all
due respect to Queen Latifah, we decided way back in 1776 that we'd had
our fill of royalty.

Mere weeks after the death of Elizabeth II came the demise of another
Elizabeth, better known as Liz, whose tenure as British prime minister
[shattered](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/10/20/liz-truss-is-britains-shortest-serving-prime-minister)
all previous records for brevity. Forty-four days after Her Majesty had
asked her to form a government, Liz Truss announced her decision to step
down. Cries of "No, Liz, stay on!" were muted indeed, while she herself
seemed to feel a sense of relief that her moment at the pinnacle of
British politics had ended so swiftly.

[]{#anchor}As a general rule, I no more care who resides at 10 Downing
Street than who lives in Buckingham Palace, since neither bears more
than the most marginal relevance to the well-being of the United States.
Even so, I confess that I found the made-for-tabloids tale of Truss's
rise and fall riveting --- not a Shakespearean tragedy perhaps but a
compelling dramedy offering raw material --- most memorably in the [form
of
lettuce](https://www.telegraphindia.com/world/british-prime-minister-liz-trusss-greatest-legacy-jokes-jokes-and-more-jokes/cid/1893266)
--- sufficient to supply stand-up comics the world over.

That Truss was manifestly unsuited to serve as prime minister should
count as the understatement of the month. Her perpetually wide-eyed look
seemingly expressed her own amazement at having high office thrust upon
her and gave the game away. Along with the entire Tory party leadership,
she was, it seemed, in on the caper --- a huge joke at the expense of
the British people.

Here was so-called liberal democracy in action. And not just any
democracy, mind you, but an ancient and hallowed one. In American
political circles, the notion persists that our own system of government
somehow derives from that of Great Britain, that despite the many
historical and substantive differences between the way Washington and
Westminster work, we both share the same political space.

We and they are exemplars, models of popular government for the rest of
the world. We and they stand arm-in-arm against autocrats and
authoritarians. The legitimacy of the British democratic system affirms
the legitimacy of our own. To others around the world aspiring to
liberty, it proclaims: This is how it's done. Now, go and do likewise.

In this particular instance, passing the torch in that ostensibly great
democracy occurred in a matter of days. Notably, however, the British
people played no part whatsoever in deciding who should succeed Truss.
Of course, neither had they played any role in installing her as prime
minister in the first place. Roughly [172,000 dues-paying
members](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/sn05125/)
of the Conservative Party had made that decision on their behalf. And
when her government abruptly imploded, even party members found
themselves consigned to the role of spectators. In a nation of some [46
million registered
voters](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/elections/electoralregistration/bulletins/electoralstatisticsforuk/december2021),
a grand total of [357 Conservative members of
parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK))
decided who would form the next government --- the equivalent of the
Democratic caucus in the House of Representatives deciding it had had
enough of Joe Biden and choosing his successor.

British Conservatives dismissed out of hand suggestions that a general
election might be in order, that ordinary Britons should have some say
in who would govern them. They did so for the most understandable of
reasons: [opinion
polls](https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/21/uk/uk-no-election-explained-intl-gbr/index.html)
indicated that in any election the Tory party would suffer catastrophic
losses. It turns out that, in the hierarchy of values to which members
of Parliament adhere, self-preservation ranks first. Students of
American politics should not find that surprising.

To be clear, all of this falls completely within the rules of the game.
Were the situation reversed, Britain's Labour Party would surely have
done likewise.

In the United Kingdom, this is how democracy works. "The People" play
the role allotted to them. That role expands or contracts to suit the
convenience of those who actually call the shots. In practice, liberal
democracy thereby becomes a euphemism for cynical manipulation. While
the results may entertain, as the saga of Liz Truss surely did, they
offer little to admire or emulate.

The entire spectacle should, however, give Americans food for thought.
If extreme partisanship, greed, and hunger for power displace any
recognizable conception of the common good, this is where we're liable
to end up.

***Charles to the Rescue***

But give the Brits this: when faced with a crisis at the heart of their
politics, their politicians dealt with it expeditiously, even
ruthlessly. In announcing economic policies to which their financial
markets objected, Truss had seemingly forgotten whom she was actually
working for. Because of that, she was promptly sacked and then just as
quickly dispatched to the political wilderness.

Credit the sovereign with saving the day. Advised to invite Conservative
MP Rishi Sunak to form a new government, Charles III did just that and
then returned to Windsor or Balmoral or whichever royal property he and
the queen consort are currently using.

Granted, the action by the new-to-the-job king was purely symbolic. Yet
its importance can hardly be overestimated. Charles affirmed the
legitimacy of what otherwise might have looked suspiciously like a
bloodless coup engineered by panicky MPs less interested in governance
than saving their own skins. He thereby more than earned his generous
paycheck, just as [his mother
had](https://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/king-charles-iii-to-inherit-38-billion-fortune-232222293.html)
over the course of seven decades when inviting pols of varying
distinction to form governments.

Of course, little of this has anything to do with democratic practice
per se. After all, no one elected Charles king, just as no one had
elected his mum queen. And while Charles inherits the title "Defender of
the Faith," no one has ever looked to a British monarch to serve as a
"Defender of Democracy." The role of the monarch is to sustain a
political order that keeps at bay the forces of anarchy, thereby
enabling some version of representative government, however flawed, to
survive.

By that measure, Britons have good cause to proclaim, "God Save the
King."

***Still Legit?***

All of which should invite us Americans to consider this
long-taken-for-granted question: When it comes to the legitimacy of our
own political system, how are we doing? Given the startling
proliferation of illiberal and antidemocratic tendencies in the American
polity, how should we rate the health of our own liberal democracy?
Indeed, does the phrase "liberal democracy" even accurately describe
what goes on in Washington and in several dozen state capitals?

That such a question has acquired genuine urgency speaks volumes about
American politics in our time. Nor does that urgency derive entirely --
perhaps not even primarily --- from the malignant presence of Donald
Trump on the national scene, regardless of what panicky reporting in
mainstream media outlets may suggest.

On all matters related to Trump, our fellow citizens --- those who are
sentient anyway --- tend to fall into two camps. In one are those who
see the former president as a transformational figure, whether for good
(Make America Great Again) or ill (paving the way for fascism). In the
other are those who view him less as cause than effect, his lingering
prominence stemming from pathologies he's skillfully exploited but had
little role in creating.

I happen to inhabit that second camp. I loathe Donald Trump. But I fear
a political, intellectual, and cultural elite that appears incapable of
responding effectively to the crisis presently engulfing the United
States.

Innumerable writers ([including
me](https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250175083/theageofillusions))
have attempted to lay out the origins and scope of that crisis and
propose antidotes. None in my estimation (myself again included) have
fully succeeded. Or at least none have persuaded Americans as to the
true source of our collective malaise and discontent.

The resulting void explains the inclination to view Trump as the root
cause of the nation's troubles --- or alternatively as our last best
hope of salvation. Yet despite the palpable hunger in some quarters to
imagine him locked up and in others to return him to the White House,
Trump is neither a demon nor a wizard. He is instead a physical
manifestation of the collective fears and fantasies to which Americans
of all political persuasions have in recent years become susceptible.

Should Trump regain the presidency in 2024 --- admittedly, a dreadful
prospect --- the crisis gripping our country would undoubtedly deepen.
But were a benign storm to sweep the Master of Mar-a-Lago into the vast
ocean depths never to be seen again, that crisis would persist.

Factors contributing to that crisis are not difficult to identify. They
include:

-   the [pervasive dysfunction](../../../../../../../../../../Users/tomengelhardt/Library/Containers/com.apple.mail/Data/Library/Mail%20Downloads/CEA0DE3F-882F-4BAA-9B8A-EB0B91549337/n%09https:/issueone.org/issues/fixing-congress/congressional-dysfunction) that grips Congress;
-   the seemingly terminal irresponsibility to which the [Republican Party](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/05/republicans-stand-for-nothing-january-6-commission/619036/) has succumbed;
-   the [corrupting influence](https://www.brennancenter.org/issues/reform-money-politics/influence-big-money) of money on politics, national and local;
-   a waning public confidence in the [impartiality of the courts](https://news.gallup.com/poll/394103/confidence-supreme-court-sinks-historic-low.aspx);
-   a "way of life" centered on [rampant consumption](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/tupperware-consumer/) with lip service paid to the rapid environmental deterioration of our world;
-   freedom defined as [radical autonomy](https://goodfaithmedia.org/freedom-without-responsibility-is-moral-adolescence/), shorn of any collective obligation;
-   grotesque [economic inequality](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2020/01/09/trends-in-income-and-wealth-inequality/) of a sort not seen since the Gilded Age of the late nineteenth century;
-   increasing levels of [violence](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/whats-behind-rising-violent-crimes-in-the-u-s-and-how-they-can-be-reducedspike-in-violence) stoked by resentments related to race and class;
-   the invasively corrosive, ever-expanding [impact](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/negative-effects-social-media/) of social media;
-   deep-seated disputes centering on the [role of religion](https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2018/january-web-only/religious-conflict-at-heart-of-our-culture-wars.html) in American life;
-   a mindless penchant for [military activism](https://mronline.org/2022/09/16/u-s-launched-251-military-interventions-since-1991-and-469-since-1798/) sustained by willful amnesia about war's actual costs and consequences;
-   a refusal to acknowledge that the era of [American global primacy](https://www.institutmontaigne.org/en/analysis/fall-american-primacy) is ending;
-   and last (but by no means least), a [loss of faith](https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=13666&context=journal_articles) in the Constitution as the essential cornerstone of our political order.

Collectively, these add up to a Bigger Truth that easily eclipses in
importance the Big Lie that presently dominates so much of American
political discourse. While obsessing over the [false
claim](https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/16/politics/trump-big-lie-gop-election)
that Trump won reelection in 2020 may be understandable, it diverts
attention from the real meaning of that Bigger Truth, namely that
**liberal democracy** no longer describes the bizarrely elaborate,
increasingly disfunctional system of governance that prevails in the
United States.

Reducing the existing system to a single phrase is a daunting
proposition. It is **sui generis**, mixing myth, greed, rank dishonesty,
and a refusal to face the music. But this much is for sure: It's
anything but governance by elected representatives chosen by an informed
electorate who deliberate and decide in the interests of the American
people as a whole.

***Siri, Where Are We?***

In my estimation, Joe Biden is a man of goodwill but limited abilities.
In ousting Donald Trump from the White House, he performed a vitally
important service to the nation. But President Biden is not just very
old. His entire outlook is as stale as a week-old bagel.

Biden clearly believes that he has a firm grasp on what our times
require. He regularly insists that we have arrived at an "inflection
point." Drawing on the familiar narrative of the twentieth century, he
believes that he has deciphered the meaning of that inflection point.
His interpretation, shared by many others among the current crop of the
Best and Brightest, centers on a conviction that a global competition
between freedom and unfreedom, democracy and autocracy defines the
overarching challenge of our time. It's us against them --- the United
States (with accommodating allies holding Uncle Sam's coat) pitted
against China and Russia, the outcome of this competition guaranteed to
determine the fate of humankind.

Forty years ago, dealing with the array of concerns that defined the
late Cold War era --- avoiding World War III, outcompeting the Soviets,
and keeping the gas pumps from running dry --- Biden might have been an
effective president. Today, he's as clueless as Liz Truss self-evidently
was, spouting bromides and advocating for programs left over from the
heyday of American liberalism.

As Biden stumbles wearily from one verbal gaffe to the next, he embodies
the exhaustion of that earlier political era. If reinvigorating the
American political order defines the urgent calling of our present
moment, he hasn't the least idea where to begin.

At the risk of violating the prevailing canons of political correctness,
let me suggest that we turn for counsel to Russia. No, not Vladimir
Putin, but Leo Tolstoy. In the conclusion to his novel **War and Peace,**
Tolstoy wrote that "modern history, like a deaf man, answers questions
no one has asked." That pithy observation captures the essence of our
own predicament: It's the questions that go unasked that are likely to
do us in.

Consider, for example, these: What if the vaunted "American way of life"
doesn't define the destiny of humankind? What if true freedom means
something different than the conception promoted in Washington or New
York, Hollywood or Silicon Valley? What if Biden's inflection point ---
should it exist --- doesn't come with a Made-in-the-U.S.A. label?

The first step toward enlightenment is to ask the right questions. Joe
Biden and the American political establishment seem remarkably blind to
the need to do just that. So are the tens of millions of Americans,
whether angry or simply baffled, who vainly stare at their smartphones
in search of answers or who look at the results of the midterm elections
and ask: Is that the best we can do?

As a nation, we are adrift in uncharted waters --- and we can't look to
King Charles to save us.
