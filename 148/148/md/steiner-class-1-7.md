### Lesson seven

Dornach, April 11, 1924\
Translated by Frank Thomas Smith

My dear friends,

Quite a large number of new members of this School are present, and I am
therefore obliged to again say a few words about its principles. First
if all, this School repreents the impulse of the anthroposophical
movement which was renewed here durng the Christmas Conference at the
Goetheanum. Previously there were several esoteric circles. All these
esoteric circles must be gradually absorbed into this School, beause
with the Christmas Conference a new spirit was introduced into the
anthroposophical movement insofar as it streams through the
Anthroposophical Society.

I have repeatedly spoken about what the difference is between the
anthropoophical movement before the Christmas Conference and the one we
now have since Christmas. Previously the Anthroposophical Society was a
kind of administrative body for anthroposophical teaching and content.
Within the Anthroposophical Society, Anthroposophy was, so to speak,
cultivated. Since Christmas anthroposophy is not only cultivated, it is
also carried out; meaning that everything which passes through the
Anthroposophical Society as activity, as thought, is anthroposophy
itself.

The renewal which has taken place must be clearly grasped, my dear
friends, and above all it must be grasped with deep earnestness. For a
distinction exists between the Anthroposophical Society in general and
this Esoteric School within the Anthroposophical Society. The
Anthroposophical Society will, as a matter of course and according to
the principle of openness, not be able to demand anything more from the
members than that they honestly recognize what anthroposophy is and that
they are in a certain sense listeners to what anthroposophy says; and
that they receive from it what their hearts, their souls can make of it.

It is different as far as the School is concerned. Those who become
members of this School declare that they want to be true representatives
of the anthroposophical movement. In this Esoteric School, which will
gradually be expanded to include three classes, the same freedom must of
course apply as it does to every member of the Anthroposophical Society;
but freedom must also apply for the Executive Council at the Goetheanum,
which is responsible for this School. In this case it means that only
those who are recognized by the School as true members can be recipients
of what the School teaches.

Therefore whatever a member of the School does should have the effect of
reflecting on anthroposophy in the world; and it must belong to the
competence of the Executive Council to remove a member if it considers
that he cannot be a representative of the anthroposophical movement. The
relationship must be mutual.

Therefore more and more a serious, in a certain sense strict spirit will
have to be utilized in the management of the School. Otherwise the
anthroposophical movement cannot advance if we do not feel that the
School is like building a rock to support anthroposophy. It is going to
be very difficult and the members of this School must know that they
must adapt to those difficulties. They are not merely anthroposophists,
they are members of an Esoteric School.

And it must be an inner obligation to consider the Executive Committee,
as it is presently constituted, as an esoteric entity. This is not
generally understood. So something must be done to bring it to the
members\' attention. It is saying much that an Executive Committee has
been esoterically formed.

Furthermore, all those who consider themselves to be legitimate members
of this School see the School as not having been founded by men, but in
fact by the will of the world\'s presently reigning spiritual powers;
something which has been instituted from the spiritual world and which
intends to act accordingly; which feels responsible to the spiritual
world alone. Therefore, anything which indicates that a member is not
taking the School seriously must lead to the cancellation of that
person\'s membership.

It is a fact that negligence has entered into the Anthroposophical
Society to a marked degree in recent years. That it ceases is one of the
tasks for the members of this School. We want to feel responsible even
for the words we speak. Above all we should feel responsible that every
word we speak is tested to the extent that we know it is true. For
untruthfulness, even when derived from what is called good intentions,
is destructive in an occult movement. There must be no illusions about
this; it must be completely clear. It is not a question of good
intentions, which are often taken very lightly, but of objective truth.
Among the first duties of an esoteric student is that he does not merely
feel obliged to say what he thinks is true, but that he feels obliged to
determine that what he says is really objectively true. For only when we
serve the divine-spiritual powers -- whose forces stream through this
School -- in the sense of objective truth, will we be able to steer
through all the difficulties which will assail anthroposophy.

What I will now say is within the circle of the School, and what is said
within the circle of the School remains within the circle of the School.
We may not forget that many people are saying something like the
following. Certain influential persons are saying: Those who represent
the principles of the Roman \[Catholic\] Church will do everything in
their power to make the individual states of the former German Empire
independent and out of them -- I am only reporting -- with the exception
of the predominance of Prussia, to reestablish the Holy Roman Empire,
which of course, when it is established by such prominence, will spread
its power over the neighboring regions. Then -- they say -- we will need
to completely destroy from the roots up the most dangerous, the worst
movements. And, they add, if the reestablishment of the Holy Roman
Empire is not successful, and it will be successful, but if not, we will
find other means to completely destroy from the roots up the most
defiant, the most dangerous movements of the present, and they are the
anthroposophical movement and the movement for Religious Renewal
\[Christian Community\].

I quote almost verbatim. And you can see that the difficulties are not
less, but every week greater, that what I say is well founded. I wish
today to speak from the heart to those who consider their membership in
this School with heartfelt seriousness. Only by such earnestness as
members of the School can we construct the necessary foundation for
navigating through the future difficulties.

You can see from this that Anthroposophy -- the movement for religious
renewal is only a branch of it -- is taken more seriously by the
opposition than by many of the members. Because when one learns that the
Holy Roman Empire, which fell in 1806, is to be reinstated in order to
eliminate such a movement, it means that it is taken very seriously
indeed. What is important is whether a movement is founded from the
spirit and not, my dear friends, how many members it has, but which
force is instilled in it directly from the spiritual world. The
opponents see that it contains a strong inner force; therefore they
choose sharp, strong rather than weak means \[to combat it\].

\*

The considerations of these Class lessons, my dear friends, have been
primarily concerned with what can be told about the encounter with the
Guardian of the Threshold, the encounter which is the first experience
towards the attainment of real and true super-sensory knowledge. Today I
would like to add something to what has already been considered.

It is not possible to claim that the encounter with the Guardian of the
Threshold has been successful until one has experienced what it means to
be outside the physical body with the human I and the astral body.
Because when the human being is enclosed within the physical body, the
only things he can perceive in his surroundings are those which he
perceives with the instruments of his physical body. And through the
instruments of the physical body only the sensible world can be
perceived -- which is a reflection of a spiritual world, one which does
not, however, reveal to the senses what it is a reflection of.

Generally speaking, it is not difficult for a person to leave the
physical body. He does so every time he falls asleep. He is then outside
the physical body. But when he is asleep outside the physical body his
consciousness is suppressed to the point of being unconscious. Only
illusory -- or perhaps even not illusory -- dreams rise up from this
unconsciousness. But through the attainment of higher knowledge leaving
the physical body takes place in fully conscious deliberateness, so that
when outside the physical body the person perceives his surroundings
exactly as he perceives the physical world with his senses when within
the physical body. He perceives the spiritual world while outside the
physical body.

But the human being is at first unconsciously asleep. Under normal
circumstances he is not aware of what he could see when outside the
physical body. And the reason for this is that he is protected from
approaching the spiritual world unprepared.

If he is sufficiently prepared, what happens then? When he is at the
abyss between the sensory world and the spiritual world, the Guardian of
the Threshold extracts his true human essence -- assuming he is prepared
as described in the previous lessons -- which can then fly over the
abyss with the means indicated in the mantric verses. And then from
beyond the threshold he can behold his own sensory physical being.

That is the first powerful impression of true knowledge, my dear
friends, when the Guardian of the Threshold can say to the human being:
See, that is how you are over there, as you appear in the physical
world; here with me you are as your inner being really is.

And now meaningful words sound out again from the Guardian of the
Threshold -- that the person is called upon, now that he is on the other
side of the abyss, how differently he sees himself on the other,
physical side. He sees himself differently. He sees himself as a
tripartite being. He sees himself as a tripartite being which expresses
itself psychically in thinking, feeling and willing. In reality they are
three humans: the thinking one, the feeling one, the willing one, which
exist in every person and are only held together in one by the physical
body in the physical world. And what the person sees there resounds from
the lips of the Guardian of the Threshold in the following way:

O see the Three\
They are the One,\
When you in earthly life\
the human form do bear.

Or also "human imprint"; one must translate the words from the occult
language.

O see the Three\
They are the One,\
When you in earthly life\
the human imprint bear.

Experience the head\'s cosmic form\
Feel the heart\'s cosmic pulse\
Think the limbs\' cosmic force

They are the Three\
The three, which as the One\
In earthly being live.

\[The mantra is written on the blackboard:\]

*O see the Three\
They are the One,\
When you in earthly life\
the human imprint bear.

Experience the head\'s cosmic form\
Feel the heart\'s cosmic pulse\
Think the limbs\' cosmic force

They are the Three\
The three, which as the One\
In earthly being live.*

The Guardian of the Threshold is indicating here how the Three -- which
separate from each other once the person leaves the physical body -- how
the Three look in relation to the physical body. The vision is directed
to the physical body, to the head, heart and limbs, and the Guardian of
the Threshold says: If you observe the human head in its true cosmic
significance, it is a mirror image of the heavenly universe. You must
look into the distance, where the universe seems to reach its boundary.
(In reality it is bounded by the spirit, not as it naively appears
physically to be.) In looking up you must recall that your round head is
a true image of the heavenly universe. And we add here, being conscious
of the mantric words:

"Experience the head\'s cosmic form"

The sign is added here \[in front of the above line\]:

![](steiner-class-1-7-img-1.jpg){class="a"}

which encourages us to pause at this line of the mantric verse in order
to envision the upward direction to the cosmic vastness, and of course
that direction is always upward from anywhere on the earth.

"Feel the heart\'s cosmic pulse"

Through this cosmic-heavenly place the cosmic rhythm resounds as cosmic
music. When we hear the human heart beating it seems as if this human
heart were only beating as a result of the human organism\'s interior
processes. In reality what beats in the heart is the counterpoint of the
cosmic rhythm which has circulated not only for thousands but for
millions of years. Therefore pause again -- the Guardian of the
Threshold says -- at the words "Feel the heart\'s cosmic pulse", and
feel what works in the heart upward as well as downward.

\[The corresponding sign is drawn:\]

![](steiner-class-1-7-img-2.jpg){class="a"}

The triangle pointing downward combines with the one pointing upward.

"Think the limbs\' cosmic force"

This cosmic force is the one concentrated from below by gravity and
other earthly forces. In our thinking -- which as earthly thinking is
only capable of understanding the earthly -- we must look downward to
grasp what streams out from the earth to work in man. Now we pause again
at "Think the limbs\' cosmic force" in the triangle pointing downward:

![](steiner-class-1-7-img-1.jpg){class="a" style="transform:scaleY(-1);-webkit-transform:scaleY(-1)"}

And we will feel the Guardian\'s words as they should affect to human
heart, the human soul today if one activates this mantric verse in the
appropriate way.

O see the Three\
They are the One,\
When you in earthly life\
the human imprint bear.

Experience the head\'s cosmic form.

The verse is spoken while making the sign before the head:

![](steiner-class-1-7-img-1.jpg){class="a"}

Feel the heart\'s cosmic pulse

One speaks the verse while making the sign before the breast:

![](steiner-class-1-7-img-2.jpg){class="a"}

Think the limbs\' cosmic force

One speaks the verse while making the sign pointing downward:

![](steiner-class-1-7-img-1.jpg){class="a" style="transform:scaleY(-1);-webkit-transform:scaleY(-1)"}

They are the Three\
The Three, which as the One\
In earthly being lives.

And you should then try, after letting these mantric verses work on the
soul, to make the senses subdued, close the eyes, hear nothing with the
ears, perceive nothing and have darkness around you for a while, so that
you are living totally in the atmosphere through which these words pass.
And in this way you will transport yourself to the sphere in initiation
which in all reality can be realized during the encounter with the
Guardian of the Threshold. This is one of the ways by which one can take
the first step beyond the threshold.

But we must let the Guardian\'s next words work upon us with great
earnestness. These words indicate that once we have crossed the
threshold everything is different from the sensory world. In the sensory
world we think that the site of thinking and mental images is the human
head. And so it is, for the sensory world. But this thinking in the head
is always mixed a little bit with willing, something which is also
perceptible for normal consciousness. Because when we move from one
thought to another we must use the will just as we use it when moving an
arm or a leg, or when willing in general. But it is a fine, delicate
willing which transfers one thought to another. When we are in the
sensory world the whole extent of thinking and a small amount of willing
are bound together in the head. As soon as we cross over the Threshold
and encounter the Guardian it is the reverse: a small amount of thinking
and much widespread willing is bound to the head. And in this willing,
which otherwise sleeps in man, we sense the spirit which forms the head
from out of the cosmos, the heavens, as it\'s spherically-shaped mirror
image in all its details.

Therefore, once we have crossed beyond the threshold, the Guardian calls
out the following words:

\[The new mantra is written on the blackboard.\]

*The head\'s spirit,\
You can will it*

And now we see that willing is something quite different from what it
previously was. Previously the senses were the transmitters of
sense-impressions, and one was not aware that the will goes through the
eyes, through the ears, that the will goes through the sense of warmth,
and through every other sense as well. Now we see that everything the
eye experiences as multiple colors, what the ear hears as multiple
sounds, what man perceives as warmth and cold, as rough and smooth,
smells and tastes etc., is all will in the spiritual world.

\[writing continues:\]

*And willing provides you with\
The senses\' multiple heaven-weaving*

If on seeing the head from the other side of the threshold one
recognizes how will goes through the head and how the senses represent
will, then he will realize how the heart contains the soul and how one
can feel the soul within the heart just as he can will the head\'s
spirit when observing the head. And now we know that when thinking is
not considered as a function of the head, but as a function of the
heart, of the soul, we realize that thinking does not belong to an
individual, but to the world; then one experiences cosmic-life, the
music of the spheres.

\[The second verse is written on the blackboard.\]

*The heart\'s soul,\
You can _feel_ it;\
And _feeling_ provides you with\
Thinking\'s germinal-waking cosmic-life.*\
You live in the radiance.\
---not in the unsubstantial radiance, but the radiance where the essence of the world appears.\
The head\'s spirit,\
You\'re able to will it;\
And willing provides you with\
The senses\' manifold heavenly weave.

summing up in the line: *You weave in wisdom.*\
Summing up what pertains to the heart\'s soul and feeling in the line: 

*You live in the radiance.*

Just as you recognize* *the senses as will, you also recognize thinking
as feeling in respect to cosmic being, when you consider the Three,
which only in the sensory world are One.

And thirdly the Guardian of the Threshold adds:

\[The third verse is written on the blackboard.\]

*The limbs\' strength,\
You\'re able to think it.*

Now we have a complete reversal. Whereas normally we consider thinking
to be concentrated in the head, here \[in the first verse\] it is the
will, as I previously explained, that is concentrated in the head.
Feeling stays in the heart, where it is also felt to be in the sensory
world; for the inner force of the heart goes over to the spiritual
world.

The limbs\' strength,\
You\'re able to *think* it.

Now thinking is brought directly into connection with the limbs, the
opposite of the sensory world.

\[Writing continues.\]

*And _thinking_ gives you\
Human striving\'s goal-oriented will;*\
thus willing becomes thinking,\
You strive in virtue.

Thus we have the complete reversal in the spiritual world as revealed to
us by the Guardian of the Threshold. Whereas we normally differentiate
willing, feeling, thinking from below upward in man, on the other side
\[of the threshold\] we differentiate man as a Three: will above in the
head, feeling in the middle, thinking below at the limbs.

We realize then how willing, concentrated in the head, is the weaving
cosmic wisdom in which we live; how feeling is the cosmic shining in
which all the spirit-beings glow; and how thinking, observed in the
limbs, is human striving, which can be lived as human virtue. And the
Three appear before spiritual vision thus:

The _head\'s_ <span style="color:#800">spirit</span>\
The _heart\'s_ <span style="color:#800">soul</span>\
The _limb\'s_ <span style="color:#800">force</span>

The mantric verse is built thus. And we must be aware of this inner
congruence, and also aware that if we let this mantric verse work on us
the following will penetrate our being:

_Heavenly weaving\
Cosmic living\
Human striving_

\[These three lines are underlined in yellow.\]

These then are the Guardian of the Threshold\'s words which accompany
our spiritual vision of the Three, which derive from the One, when we
cross over into the world beyond the threshold:

The head\'s spirit,\
You\'re able to will it;\
And willing provides you with\
The senses\' manifold heavenly weave.\
You weave in wisdom.

The heart\'s soul,\
You can feel it;\
And feeling provides you with\
Thinking\'s germinal-waking cosmic-life.\
You live in the radiance.

The limbs\' strength,\
You\'re able to think it.\
And thinking gives you\
Human striving\'s goal -oriented will;\
You strive in virtue.

These are the sensations which must flow through the soul if real
knowledge is to be obtained; these are the admonitions which the
Guardian of the Threshold lets resound at the moment when he also tells
us:

Come in,\
The gate is opened;\
You will become\
A real human being.

\[Written on the blackboard:\]

*Come in,\
The gate is opened;\
You will become\
A real human being.*

Those are the words which for thousands and thousands of years have
resounded at all the gates to the spiritual world, admonishing and yet
encouraging:

Come in,\
The gate is opened;\
You will become\
A real human being.

Just imagine, my sisters and brothers, that you say to yourselves for
the first time: I want to take the Guardian of the Threshold\'s words
seriously; I recognize that I was not yet a human being; I recognize
that I will become one through insight into the spiritual world.

Imagine, my dear sisters and brothers, you say the second time: Oh, I
didn\'t take the words seriously enough the first time; I must admit
that I need not one, but two of the stages from where I am now in order
to become a true human being.

And imagine you say the third time: I recognize that I need three of the
stages from the point where I now stand, at which I am not a true human,
in order to become a true human being.

The first admonition, which you give to yourself, is earnest. The second
admonition is more earnest. But the third admonition must bear the most
earnest impression of all. And if you can awaken this threefold
admonition of earnestness from the depths of your souls, then you will
have an inkling of what it means to become a true human being through
knowledge. And then you will return to the first admonition -- as we
will also do now -- as a transforming verse in our souls.

O see the three\
They are the one,\
When you in earthly life\
the human imprint bear.

Experience the head\'s cosmic form\
Feel the heart\'s cosmic pulse\
Think the limbs\' cosmic force

They are the Three\
The Three, which as the One\
In earthly being live.

Thus, my sisters and brothers, has it resounded in the hearts of all who
have striven for knowledge ever since there have been human beings on
the earth.

There has been a pause in the striving since the dawn of the fifth
post-Atlantean cultural epoch. According to the will of the
divine-spiritual entities who guide humanity, the pause has come to an
end. Now it is up to you to make human hearts open again in a worthy way
to what the wise guides of humanity raise up to the vision of what works
in the world as spirit, what as spirit works in the world in humanity,
as the crown of existence.
