# Why I am still on Earth

## by Michael Schreyer

What may the future bring us\
of known and unknown things?\
Stoking future fear is nothing new\
and the ways are well known to us:

killer viruses, cold rooms, naught to eat,\
gas and oil from Russia blocked,\
industry and commerce marginalized\
to further fuel the chaos.

Here in Germany waves on waves\
of migrants have come for many years,\
allured by politics and other forces\
to finally complete the chaos

by draining out the social systems\
and making German values laughable.\
What politics alone doesn\'t achieve\
the media surely will.

Chaos must by enhanced from year to year\
in order for the "great savior" to finally come,\
whom all the poverty-stricken\
will then greet with great joy.

The dictatorship has long been prepared\
for the great Prince of Lies to persevere.\
The great question then is what to do?\
Why am I still on earth?

I see that I will be silent no longer\
and must share my insight.\
The course of events is in the process\
of spreading more an image of illness:

Justice only serves the powerful,\
the spirit is inserted in the form of lies,\
and in the background corporations rule us all,\
but follow orders from still further above

and torment the people with economic power.\
The curative concept is well known to me, to wit:\
society is formed by three domains\
that must be allowed autonomy,

be able to follow their own laws:\
Equality tames power through civil rights,\
spiritual culture gives the creative forces wings,\
and only human needs govern economic power.

Thus only can society be healed!\
But it is only possible\
if many people recognize such healing forces\
as society\'s salvation.

Where are those many people?\
I must reach those who share my conviction,\
and convince the rest!\
That is why I am still on earth.
