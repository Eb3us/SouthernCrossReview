# Liberty, Equality, Fraternity

## by Michael Schreyer

The ideals of the French Revolution,\
brought to the world much to early,\
misunderstood for so many years,\
are barely contained now with meaning.

So they remain merely as slogans\
incapacitated for action.\
How can we do what\'s needed\
to transpose them into reality?

The human essence is lacking,\
the slogans remain abstract.\
Freedom is freedom for the other\
as Rosa Luxemburg said.

Only when freedom is granted the other\
can he truly develop as a person.\
Equality of rights is in the Constitution,\
but meeting and seeing each other\
in daily togetherness are not practiced\
where power and hierarchy reign.

Fraternity means to see the other\'s needs\
and not what I can gain through him.\
Thus must I live every day\
giving the other freedom and rights,\
readily accepting his needs\
and forgetting for the moment\
my own desires and interests.

Only when the other is the reason for my actions\
can society be healed\
and human dignity infuse our deeds.
