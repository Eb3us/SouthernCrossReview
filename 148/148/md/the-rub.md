I was sitting on the veranda, the winter sun high enough to warm me. I
closed the book I was reading -- a kindle edition of Stephen King\'s The
Green Mile -- and looked into the small forest which began about thirty
yards from where I was sitting. I saw, or thought I saw, a face there
within the green. It was unclear, unfocused, so to speak. A cloud-like
formation crept from the east to cover it, but then dissipated. I tried
to determine who it was, but could not. I thought of Jesus, whom I had
had occasion to meet some years ago in a dream when I lived in Geneva. I
wrote it down in my "dream book":

John Rogan was a friend and colleague from when we worked together for
American Airlines in LaGuardia airport in New York City. When we worked
the night shift we usually went to a nearby bar afterward for a couple
of beers to unwind. Paul Gibson -- another friend and colleague,
accompanied us. One night several months after Paul had quit and
returned home to a small town upstate new York -- the big apple wasn\'t
for him, or for his wife, Anna -- John and I were working late when a
call came for him at the ticket counter, It was Anna: Paul had died
suddenly from encephalitis and she wanted us, John and me, to be pall
bearers at his funeral in a few days. John waved me over, covered the
phone\'s mouthpiece and told me what Anna had said. I nodded and he told
Anna that we\'d be there. I walked back to the passenger I\'d abandoned
while John wrote down the instructions about how to get there. John and
Paul were around my age, 27.

I hadn\'t seen or had contact with John in over 25 years. So was that
face I thought I saw (without John) watching me now from the forest
Jesus again, or someone else? It was hazy enough to be either male or
female. But if it was Jesus of Nazareth it would have been inconsistent,
not to mention ungentlemanly, to appear to me without Mary of Magdala.

The other possibility is that my eyes weren\'t open at all, that I had
fallen asleep, perchance to dream. I guess there\'s the rub, but not
necessarily. If Jesus wanted to appear to me it would be easier, more
convenient that is, to appear in a dream than in waking life when I
could have got all excited and started yelling or fainting or calling
the media for an interview.

On the other hand, doesn\'t Jesus have better things to do than have tea
with me? I can\'t believe he\'d be so disorganized. I used to work as a
management consultant specializing in organization development (OD). One
of my dogmas concerned the need to share responsibility. Jesus is at
least second (well, maybe third) in command of a huge organization
comprising every person who ever lived. Therefore the angels who,
according to those who claim to know, are in charge of influencing
individuals and their karma, are divinely organized to make the best of
an until now chaotic and often cruel human nature. Some Russian once
said that most people are dissatisfied with the suffering of life, but
are afraid of death. That\'s actually what Hamlet meant, for he was
talking about the dream that is death. Remember that the speech starts
with *To be or not to be*.

I went back to my chair on the veranda the next day and stared out at
the same place in the *bosquecito* , but did not see the visitor again.
I closed my eyes in an attempt to determine whether what I\'d seen the
day before was seen through a glass (eyelids) darkly. No such luck, but
I was visited by a myriad of other weird stuff, mostly memories of past
mistakes and joyous occasions. If you think I\'m talking like a chump
(antiquated word for asshole), I suggest and urgently request that you
stop reading because it\'s going to get worse.

In the nineteen-twenties Carl Gustav Jung published an essay
entitled *The Spiritual Problem of Modern Man*. While reading it and
nodding in agreement, I couldn\'t help thinking that the problem Jung so
eloquently described almost a hundred years ago is not only still with
us, but has become increasingly so.

Jung wrote after the First World War, but saw no hope that it would
really be "the war to end all wars" as prophesied by cynically
optimistic politicians. It is the modern human being who, by the very
fact of being modern and thus looking into his own unconscious
(something he had never done before) is so bereft of meaning that he is
capable of anything and everything. "Psychology", even a hundred years
ago, had become sufficiently popular to make at least the educated
person wonder what the hell was going on in his own interior, in his own
psyche. The official religions had lost their authority once it became
obvious that they had as little knowledge of what life and death mean as
a Doctor of Philosophy or Charlie Chaplin.

Today the churches with their perverted priests and dogmas, are even
more degenerate than they were then. They disgust rather than inspire.
Even the sincere clerics can do no more than preach about the necessity
of having faith. In what? In what they are told by the interpreters of
the holy writs. So this leaves us forced to face the existential
dilemmas of human life without the helpful crutch of religious dogma.

Jung: "*How totally different did the world appear to medieval man! For
him the earth was eternally fixed and at rest in the center of the
universe...Men were all children of God under the loving care of the
Most High, who prepared them for eternal blessedness; and all knew
exactly what they should do and how they should conduct themselves in
order to rise from a corruptible world to an incorruptible and joyous
existence. Such a life no longer seems real to us, even in our dreams."*

In place of religious dogma, scientific materialism has codified its own
dogma. The Darwinian theory of evolution has certainly become dogma in
its dictionary definition: *a principle or set of principles laid down
by an authority as incontrovertibly true.*

Darwin\'s theory is correct as far as it goes, but who or what is the
authority that deems it incontrovertibly true? Scientific materialism
itself of course. My only argument is not directed against its
observable facts but the benediction: *natural selection*: "The process
according to which organisms with favorable traits are more likely to
reproduce. In doing so, they pass on these traits to the next
generation. Over time this process allows organisms to adapt to their
environment." Therefore *Nature* selects the favorable traits likely to
reproduce. And who, may I ask, is "Nature", by definition capable of
considering the advantages of certain traits and deciding which to
infiltrate the next generation. Nobody decides anything, say the
scientists; it\'s a random process. This dogma is very much with us.

Then there is the Marxian theory of social development. Here the
motivational principle is again automatic: economic interests defined by
social classes. This theory suffered a blow in 1989 that put it into
intensive therapy: the fall of the Berlin Wall and eventually of the
Soviet Union. Nevertheless, economic growth or lack of it remains the
criterion of our times -- whether it takes place in a democratic or
authoritarian political scenario. The human being, lost in this
labyrinth, has lost his individuality and has become a mere abstract
number in the bureau of statistics. He can only play the role of an
interchangeable unit of infinitesimal importance, a speck of matter in a
random cosmos. The effect for many, perhaps for the majority, is that
life has no meaning.

However, Jung saw an increasing interest in psychology, at least among
the western educated classes, and considered it not only positive but
necessary. He meant not only the work of Freud and others, but also such
psychic phenomena as astrology, Theosophy, Anthroposophy and
parapsychology. He compares it to Gnostic thought in the first and
second centuries after Christ.

Well, yes and no. Rudolf Steiner, the founder of Anthroposophy,
eventually put aside his Hindu dress and donned instead German
philosophical idealism, Christianity and a black bow tie. Luckily
however, he retained his strong belief in reincarnation and karma.

Gnosis is Greek for wisdom or knowledge; science is Latin for knowledge.
Anthroposophy is English (and German) for knowledge of man. It seems
that Anthroposophy is closer to Gnosticism than even Rudolf Steiner
realized, not having had access to the Gnostic Gospels and other
documents discovered after his death.

All this doesn\'t tell me who was looking at me (or not) from the woods
in front of my porch or whether the experience was interior or exterior.
But it at least tells me that I\'m not alone and that many things are
happening both inside and outside -- or perhaps they are one. It reminds
me of Rudolf Steiner\'s meditation meant for students of his Esoteric
School, back in 1924, about the time Carl Jung was writing his essay
about *The Spiritual Problem of Modern Man*.
