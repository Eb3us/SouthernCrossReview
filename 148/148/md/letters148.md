RE: [Breathe](https://southerncrossreview.org/141/hemsley-breathe.html) by Becky Hemsley

I just wanted to say, your poem was read on tik tok and for the first
time in a long time I felt "seen"

I am a teacher, an assistant head of year, a dog mum and a wife in
training and I love all those parts of my life but sometimes I forget to
stop, listen and breathe.

This poem means so so much to me especially as a nature lover (thanks to
my dogs, I have no choice) but I often find myself feeling content
amongst the trees.

I am so inspired, thank you.

This poem seems like it was written for every woman reading it, but it
makes you feel as though it was written for the reader. I loved her
style, wisdom, and fluidity. Beautiful prose!

I came across your poem on social media few days ago. It lived in me
since. It describes my journey, my struggles, my life if you will. Thank
you for writing these words. I just shared it on my LI profile as well
hoping more women can be touched. Maybe it will bring a resolve to
someone -- as it did to me.

She wrote how she felt\
When her life made no sense\
When too many layers\
Made her feel tense

She helped us to stop\
and talk to our heart\
Each time we needed\
A brand new start.

Thank you Becky

I have been searching for a piece to frame in a small bedroom reading
nook. Nothing I've read touched my soul quite like this piece. It was
weird how we found each other. Today, I went to walk around the lake in
my neighborhood, spotted this garden and wandered in. In the middle of
the garden, there's the most serene spot. I stood in the center of an
oasis shadowed by leaves, with a small cascading water feature, watching
as the sunbeams danced their way through tree limbs to a bed of grass
and soil beneath my feet. The orange hues of the leaves mesmerized me. I
stood in the gentle breeze for moments I wished would never cease. It
was the most peaceful my soul has felt in months. My breath felt the
lightest it has in years. I've been in a state of emotional limbo and in
that moment I felt  the bar I've trying to squeeze under lift away. I
made it back home and felt a rush of determination. I've been delaying
everything in my life because I've be feeling heavy, confused,
pressured, bogged down by work, family, trying to figure it all out. On
top of this, I recently moved to Oakland, CA, so my apartment floor is
scattered with items to put away, to donate, to gift. (Honestly, I am in
a state of fluster with a huge ever growing to do list). Imagine this:
I'm sitting crosslegged in the midst of a living room, deciding what to
do first. I have frame in my hand, saying, "I will start small and hang
this frame." I grab my laptop and begin my search. I am led to type
\"breathe" into a google search bar. The first suggestive type
is "Breathe by Becky Hemsley." I indulge, click the first link, and
 began to read this poem. Tears flood my eyes, as I realize this is my
poem. 

So I thank you, Mrs. Hemsley for writing, and the other you's for making
it available for my eyes and soul to reach. You have a 26 year old fan.
A transplant from Nassau, Bahamas, who some how ended up in California
and understands everything is going to be okay.

P.S. I am leaving out many very short comments such as "Beautiful",
"Wonderful", etc. \[ed.\]

RE: [The Diamond way](https://southerncrossreview.org/148/diamond.html)

Dear Frank Thomas Smith:

Thanks so much for re-publishing my essay (from 1989) on "Baseball as
Esoteric Ritual!" I enjoy your magazine so much more when it is
published one story or chapter at a time. I am still a Red Sox fan.

Esoteric regards,

Hannah M.G. Shapero
