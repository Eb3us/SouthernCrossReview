<p class="intro">Earlier this year, four gaunt horsemen in black shrouds cantered down
Pennsylvania Avenue. Since no one complained or even noticed, they
grazed their hungry steeds on the White House lawn. They’ve been there
ever since and threaten never to leave.</p>
<p>This interview with them is a Tomdispatch exclusive:</p>
<p>“First Horseman, please state your name for our readers.”</p>
<p>“My name is Oil and my price is $50 per barrel and higher yet to
come.”</p>
<p>“Fine, and you’re from?”</p>
<p>“Hubbert’s Peak.”</p>
<p>“Is that in Colorado?”</p>
<p>No response.</p>
<p>“Are you in Washington for business or pleasure?”</p>
<p>“Both, actually. While wrecking the American economy, I’m also hoping
to bring immense happiness to a handful of giant energy
corporations.”</p>
<a target="_blank" href="a"><div class="polaroid"><img class="b" src="davis-book-cover.png" alt="Ecology of Fear book cover" style="width:100%"><div class="container"><p>Buy the Book!</p></div></div></a>
<p>“Well, that’s a popular cause in this town, so please enjoy your
stay. Now, Second Horseman, can I have your name for the record.”</p>
<p>“My name is Proliferation, son of Wot and destroyer of worlds.”</p>
<p>“Wot?”</p>
<p>“The War on Terrorism. Only the strong and nuclear-armed shall
survive, so sayeth Bush.”</p>
<p>“I see, you’re a traveling salesman. Visited any exotic locales
lately?”</p>
<p>“Mainly Tehran and Pyongyang with some overnights in Karachi, Delhi,
and Brasilia. But I have a heavy travel schedule over the next
year.”</p>
<p>“Enjoy your frequent-flyer points. And now, number three, if I could
interrupt for a minute?”</p>
<p>“No problem. My name is Global Chaos. I was just sorting through some
vacation photos. Take a look.”</p>
<p>“Thanks. Hmm, very National Geographic.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I love the great outdoors. This is a melting glacier in Alaska.
Here’s a flood in Bangladesh. Oh, one of my favorites, the epic drought
in the American Southwest.”</p>
<p>“Eh, what are those white objects?”</p>
<p>“You mean the bones?”</p>
<p>“Bones? Maybe I’d better move on and meet Horseman Four.”</p>
<p>“I am the pale rider and my name is Plague.”</p>
<p>“I bet your first name is Bubonic?”</p>
<p>“No, that’s my cousin. I’m the avian influenza pandemic.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, but have I heard of you?”</p>
<p>“The World Health Organization says I am an unprecedented threat to
humanity. The world is utterly unprepared to deal with my arrival.”</p>
<p>“Well, that’s one helluva blurb.”</p>
<p>“Yes, and my grandfather killed 100 million people in 1918-19.”</p>
<p>“No kidding? Well, thanks for sharing. Now, I wonder if I can ask a
few questions of the entire group. First, does your posse, band,
whatever, have an agent or publicist?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Saint John.”</p>
<p>“OK, and has he arranged your DC publicity? Have you had much
election-year media exposure? You know, O’Reilly, the Washington Post,
Meet the Press, the Lehrer News Hour.?”</p>
<p>“Oh, no,” laughed Chaos, “no one has interviewed us.”</p>
<p>“Come on, four big guys in black on horses, here in front of the
White House during an election season.”</p>
<p>“No, honest,” Proliferation chipped in, “they don’t want to
acknowledge our presence.”</p>
<p>“Well, how about the other side, the opposition party? Surely,
they’ve looked to you for a juicy angle. I mean the horse doo-doos all
over the White House lawn, not to mention.. Hey are you guys even
citizens? Do you have passports?”</p>
<p>“I can assure you,” Proliferation insisted, “none of that matters. No
one wants to admit we’re here.”</p>
<p>“But why?”</p>
<p>Plague spoke. “Apocalypse denial. Your whole society is suffering
from acute apocalypse denial.”</p>
<p>“That’s preposterous, we’re afraid of all kinds of things these days.
We tremble at the very thought of anthrax in the mail, plutonium on the
subways, or botulism in our Big Macs. We have regular orange
alerts.”</p>
<p>Plague interrupted. “No, that’s the whole point. You’re so terrified
of the shadows your rulers project on the wall that you can’t see us
standing here, right outside your door.”</p>
<p>“Hmm, so I guess you guys are the real deal?”</p>
<p>“Believe it.”</p>
<p>“So what’s your business plan?”</p>
<p>Chaos cleared his throat. “For generations, the wealthier 40 percent
of your population has lived inside an extraordinary bubble of
privilege.”</p>
<p>“In addition to enormous security of wealth and status,”
Proliferation took over, “your affluent classes have been sheltered from
the bitter winds of history.”</p>
<p>“We’re the bitter winds,” added Plague.</p>
<p>“And we’ll burst your bubble,” Oil promised.</p>
<p>A pale horse neighed.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately my recorder has run out of tape. I’m afraid we’ll have
to end the interview with that.”</p>
<p>“No problem,” Oil smiled. “Y’all come back and visit. We’re not going
anywhere.”</p>
