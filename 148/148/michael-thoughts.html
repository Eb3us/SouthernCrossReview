<p class="intropoem">What may the future bring us<br />
of known and unknown things?<br />
Stoking future fear is nothing new<br />
and the ways are well known to us:</p>
<p>Killer viruses, freezing rooms, nothing to eat,<br />
gas and oil from Russia blocked,<br />
industry and commerce marginalized<br />
to further fuel the chaos.</p>
<p>Here in Germany waves on waves<br />
of migrants have come for many years,<br />
allured by politics and other forces<br />
to finally complete the chaos</p>
<p>by draining out the social systems<br />
and making German values laughable.<br />
What politics alone doesn't achieve<br />
the media surely will.</p>
<p>Chaos must by enhanced from year to year<br />
in order for the “great savior” to finally come,<br />
whom all the poverty-stricken<br />
will then greet with great joy.</p>
<p>The dictatorship has long been prepared<br />
for the great Prince of Lies to persevere.<br />
The great question then is what to do?<br />
Why am I still on earth?</p>
<p>I see that I will be silent no longer<br />
and must share my insight.<br />
The course of events is in the process<br />
of spreading more an image of illness:</p>
<p>Justice only serves the powerful,<br />
the spirit is inserted in the form of lies,<br />
and in the background corporations rule us all,<br />
but follow orders from still further above</p>
<p>and torment the people with economic might.<br />
The curative concept is well known to me, to wit:<br />
society is formed by three domains<br />
that must be allowed autonomy,</p>
<p>be able to follow their own laws:<br />
Equality tames power through civil rights,<br />
spiritual culture gives the creative forces wings,<br />
and only human needs govern economic power.</p>
<p>Thus only can society be healed!<br />
But it is only possible<br />
if many people recognize such healing forces<br />
as society's salvation.</p>
<p>Where are those many people?<br />
I must reach those who share my conviction,<br />
and convince the rest!<br />
That is why I am still on earth.</p>
