<h1>The Founding of the First Waldorf School</h1>

<h3>Chapter 10 of “Rudolf Steiner: Herald of a New Epoch”</h3>
<h2>by Stewart Easton</h2>


</header>

<main>
<p class="intro">In earlier chapters of this book it was shown how when quite a
young man Rudolf Steiner interested himself in education. While he was
still at school he tutored fellow-pupils of his own age and younger;
when he was at the Vienna Institute of Technology he eked out his meager
scholarship funds by tutoring, and then for several years he was
responsible for the education of a severely handicapped boy, who was
eventually able to become entirely normal and qualify as a doctor. In
view of what has been said in this book about Steiner’s extraordinary
capacity for observation, and his intuitive grasp of what lies behind
the perceptible world, it will be readily appreciated that in all his
youthful educational work he was constantly learning from his
experience, and observing how human beings develop and change during
childhood. It is, therefore, not surprising that as soon as he had a
magazine at his disposal in which he could say what he wanted, he began
to write educational articles, little though these may perhaps have been
appreciated in the last years of the nineteenth century by the rather
critical subscribers to the Berlin Magazine for Literature. Even at this
time he took the position that it was the primary task of the teacher to
awaken abilities in his students, and not to stuff them with knowledge,
or “transmit to them our own convictions.”</p>
<p>When a few years later he founded the magazine Luzifer-Gnosis whose
subscribers knew that their magazine would be a vehicle for Rudolf
Steiner’s ideas in every field, it was also natural for him to revert
fairly often to social and educational questions in which he was vitally
interested. The articles on the social order written for Luzifer-Gnosis
in 1905 and 1906 necessarily lacked those ideas which he was later to
describe in such detail, because, as we have seen, Steiner was not yet
ready to speak of the threefold nature of man and so could not speak of
the threefold nature of society. But in his fundamental educational
lecture first given in 1907 and then personally revised for publication,
after having been given in a slightly different form to many different
audiences, he was already able to enunciate all the major educational
principles later used in his educational work. In this lecture called
The Education of the Child in the Light of Theosophy (or Anthroposophy)
Steiner explains how a child in the first seven years of his life until
the change of teeth lives in his will forces and learns by imitation,
never by precept; how from the change of teeth to puberty (from the age
of 7 to 14) he lives in the element of feeling, making it necessary for
his studies to be saturated with artistic feeling, and therefore for him
to be guided by a teacher with whom he should develop a relationship of
love as well as respect; and how only at puberty can he really begin to
think independently as his intellect for the first time becomes free.
Human willing, feeling, and thinking thus follow each other in time, as
first the physical, then the etheric and astral bodies, are successively
developed until the young person at last acquires his own earthly I or
ego at the age of about 21.</p>
<p>The entire educational programme of the Waldorf School at Stuttgart
and subsequent schools either bearing this name, or called Steiner
schools after the name of their originator, or after other personalities
or higher beings to whom the school founders feel related, was already
implicit in this lecture; and it would almost be possible to deduce an
educational programme from it. Everything in Steiner education is based
upon the child and his development, and not at all on the supposed needs
of society. Thus the word “education,” which in Latin means “leading
forth” may truly be applied to this form of education, as distinct from
the word “learning” which is more properly applied to most educational
systems. In this lecture also first appears, most significantly, a
passage in which Steiner voices his confident hope that some day he will
be asked to take the lead in bringing his educational ideas to
realization. “These things,” he writes, “can of course only be touched
on here, but in future Anthroposophy will be called upon to give the
necessary indications, and this it is in a position to do. For it is no
empty abstraction but a body of living facts which can give guiding
lines for the conduct of life’s realities.”</p>
<p>Twelve years had passed before Steiner was at last given the
opportunity to put his educational ideas into operation. As a result of
his first lecture to the workers in Emil Molt’s tobacco factory he was
asked by them how the next generation could grow up free from the
cultural deprivation from which they themselves had suffered. He
immediately responded positively to the question and its implied
request; and even before a full week had gone by after his lecture, he
was already meeting for practical educational discussions with Emil Molt
and two other anthroposophists, both of whom were to play a leading part
in the school, and one of whom had been very active in the Threefold
Movement from the beginning. The discussion, which was very
wide-ranging, naturally turned upon the cultural realm of the Threefold
Social Order, and on the necessity for new cultural impulses. But
Steiner also spoke at length about how necessary it was for industrial
workers to become aware of the world outside the field of their own
specialized work, and to win back the dignity of which they had been
robbed when first they came to be regarded virtually as interchangeable
parts in the industrial system.</p>
<p>Up to this time Emil Molt, who was a strongly paternalistic employer,
genuinely interested in the welfare of his employees, had been offering
extension courses in various subjects to the workers. But they had
excited relatively little interest, and he was thinking already of
abandoning them for lack of support. But from the beginning the workers
were fired with enthusiasm for the idea of a totally different kind of
school for their children, and Molt, who was already a leader in the
Threefold movement, immediately expressed himself as ready to devote the
profits of his enterprise as “gift-money” for this new cultural venture.
After numerous discussions Steiner agreed to become what he called the
“guide and spiritual adviser” of the school, whereupon Molt bought a
downtown restaurant which he proceeded to have remodeled as a school.
The prospective student body for the opening, which was planned for
September in the same year, consisted of the workers’ children, about a
hundred and fifty in all, to which were quickly added the children of
the Stuttgart anthroposophists, approximately fifty in number, and
coming almost entirely from a different class from their new
fellow-students. Thus the school was planned from the beginning to
include all grades up to the twelfth. A complete educational programme
therefore had to be offered, which would include the classes in the
various arts that Steiner considered essential, and teachers had to be
found for all of them. Perhaps fortunately, a few professional
educators, who were also anthroposophists, were available with the
necessary teaching experience. But the vast bulk of the teachers were
chosen by Steiner himself from volunteers from every walk of life who
wished to take part in the epoch-making experiment, and who were already
familiar with Anthroposophy and competent in the subjects they would be
teaching. Many of these men and women left their existing employment to
work with him in this venture; and it is probable that such a group of
dedicated and gifted teachers has never been assembled before or since
at the beginning of any school in history.</p>
<p>Obviously, the first task was to train them, both as teachers, and as
pioneers in a new form of education. All Steiner schools, including this
first one, are run by their faculty. For this reason it would be
necessary for the teachers to learn how to work together as a team in a
spirit of harmony in spite of the absence of any overall authority. At
the beginning, instead of having such an authority over them they
possessed a “guide and spiritual adviser” in whom they all had absolute
confi­dence, and he in turn had confidence in them because they had all
been handpicked by him. The State authorities of Württemberg had granted
him the right to make the experiment over a period of three years,
although all he had submitted to them was a memorandum telling them how
he proposed to run the school. Thus Steiner was in the unique position
for an educator of having no immediate financial worries, no inspector
breathing down his neck, and an absolute freedom to select his teachers
and his curriculum, with a student body whose parents were willing
absolutely to entrust their children to him and those whom he had
selected.</p>
<p>It was arranged that Rudolf Steiner should meet with all the teachers
in Stuttgart in late August and early September for the purpose of
giving them a special training course which would continue almost until
the opening of the school. This opening was scheduled for September 7th,
1919, under five months from the day the decision was made to create a
new school in Stuttgart run according to principles derived from the
anthroposophical view of man. But before giving this course an important
task awaited him - to return to Dornach and tell the members there what
was being planned at Stuttgart, while at the same time giving
encouragement and advice to those who were working on the
Goetheanum.</p>
<p>In this series of lectures given to the Dornach members, published
under the title of Education as a Social Problem, Steiner began by
speaking about the necessity for the Threefold Social Order, on which he
had been working in Germany for months, insisting in particular on the
need for the fundamental transformation of cultural life. He spoke of
the great dangers threatening mankind from the one-sided development of
the intellect, a faculty that men had only recently acquired for
themselves, independent of divine inspiration. They are able now to use
this faculty for their own ends, but if it is not to fall into the hands
of Ahriman it must in future be permeated by the Christ Impulse. If men
do not use their thinking capacity to fulfill the divine purposes it
will necessarily he misused, and all kinds of new evils will be allowed
entry into the world.</p>
<p>This introduction, on a theme to which he was to revert often in the
last year of his life, was here given mainly as a background for his
detailed explanation of the supreme importance of the role played by
teachers in the social structure, and the qualities that would be
required of them in the new school - how essential it was that they
should be thoroughly versed in the science of spirit, so that they could
have a true appreciation of the children committed to their charge, as
beings of body, soul, and spirit, whose soul faculties would be
unfolding beneath their gaze year by year; and how essential it was for
these teachers to be able to develop living imaginative thinking in
themselves. “The burning question is therefore,” he told his audience,
“how can teacher training be transformed in future? It can be
transformed in only one way, and that is, that the teacher himself
absorbs what can come from spiritual science as knowledge of man’s true
nature. The teacher must be permeated by the reality of man’s connection
with the supersensible worlds. He must be in the position to see in the
growing child evidence that he has descended from the supersensible
world through conception and birth, has clothed himself with a body, and
wishes to acquire here in the physical world what he cannot acquire in
the life between death and a new birth, and in which the teacher has to
help, Every child should stand before the soul of the teacher as a
question posed by the supersensible world to the sense world. This
question cannot be asked in a definite and comprehensive way in regard
to every individual child unless one employs the knowledge that comes
from spiritual science concerning the nature of man.” [Education as a
Social Problem, N.Y. 1969, Lecture 4]</p>
<p>As soon as Steiner had given his last lecture in this cycle, a
lecture in which he especially stressed the dangers of the development
of one-sided intelligence, he betook himself to Stuttgart where his
chosen teachers were awaiting him, and here for fourteen consecutive
days he gave three separate courses, one in the morning, another in the
afternoon, and the third in the evening. The course given in the morning
was called The General Knowledge of Man as a Basis for Pedagogy, a
beauti­fully exact title for the actual content of the course which has
been published in several editions in English under the title of Study
of Man. This course is still regarded as the essential foundation for
all work in teacher training programmes for Steiner schools; and indeed
it is the most comprehensive course in human psychology as well as in
educational theory ever given by Rudolf Steiner. In particular the
nature of man as a threefold being is strongly stressed and illustrated
in numerous ways. The second course is published under the title
Practical Course for Teachers, and it contains general and specific
information on both the subject matter and methods used for children
from different age groups. One of these lectures was also devoted to the
arts as they would be taught in the Waldorf School. The third course was
the so-called Pedagogical Course, or Course on Educational Practice.
These courses were completed in the evening of September 5th. The next
day, on which no lectures were given, was spent by the teachers in
making ready for the next day’s ceremonial opening - and perhaps for the
beginning of the digestion of the concentrated food of the previous
fortnight! The absence of an assembly hall in the remodeled restaurant
that was to serve as the school made it necessary for the opening
ceremony, attended by parents and children as well as teachers and
anthroposophists, to be held elsewhere. The school music teacher opened
with a Bach Prelude, which was followed by a recitation by Marie Steiner
and a demonstration of eurythmy by some children whom she had
instructed. Then came an introductory speech by Emil Molt, followed by
Rudolf Steiner’s opening address. This, of course was the highlight of
the morning’s proceedings. In the afternoon, in an atmosphere of general
festivity, the teachers and children were introduced to each other, and
at night all the teachers were invited to a performance of The Magic
Flute in the Stuttgart Opera House. There Rudolf Steiner sat by Herr
Molt, pointing out to the industrialist where the teachers were all
sitting in different parts of the theatre. On such occasions the years
fell away from him - he was now 58 - and he was as animated and excited
as any of the children. School began the next day.</p>
<p>Steiner’s address at the opening of the school, important though it
was, cannot be considered here in any detail As he always did during the
lifetime of the Threefold social movement, he related the establishment
of the school to the need for a new impulse in the cultural life of
Germany, an impulse which should from the beginning be drawn from the
free cultural realm of the Threefold Social Order. The school was in
truth an utterly free enterprise in an educational world dominated at
the time by the state, and with educational requirements set by the
state. Moreover it was a unitary school, and - an extraordinary
innovation at that time - a co-educational school, offering only general
education, without the specialization that in Germany of that age was
thought to be such a great educational advance. The first Waldorf School
was, indeed, so unusual at the time, and in many respects Waldorf
education is so unusual even in our own age that we shall devote some
space to its general features. It is worth mentioning here that Steiner,
even in his opening address, made it clear that the school was not and
never would become a school for teaching Anthroposophy. The teachers
would work from an anthroposophical impulse and out of the knowledge of
Anthroposophy that they had acquired, including knowledge of the
threefold nature of the human being. But they would tell the children
nothing of what lay behind their teaching. Even in the religious classes
that were given in all German schools in the 1920s no anthroposophical
concepts were taught. A Catholic priest taught the Catholic children and
a Protestant pastor taught the Protestant children. Those parents who
were neither Catholic nor Protestants could choose for their children a
general nondenominational Christianity course given by one of the
regular school teachers, which might of course be somewhat influenced by
the anthroposophical orientation of the teacher. In the early years of
the school it became, as it turned out, by far the most popular of the
three religious courses!</p>
<p>At the center of all anthroposophical thinking in the realm of
education is the recognition that a child is not simply a small man or
woman, and he should not be treated as such, reasoned with, preached to,
filled with intellectual knowledge by adults, and expected to grow up in
the image of his parents or teachers. A child is a potentially but not
actually mature human being who will develop through the years of
childhood at a pace that is virtually the same for all children, since
the pace is governed not only by biological laws but by laws of the soul
and spirit. At birth a child frees his physical body from his mother’s
womb, at the change of teeth he frees his etheric body, and at puberty
his astral body. Thus for the first seven years of his life, all
education should be directed toward enabling him to make proper use of
his physical body. With the change of teeth and the freeing of the
etheric body, his education is directed primarily to this body for the
next seven years until puberty. At the age of fourteen the astral body
is usually entirely freed - indeed puberty actually consists of this
freeing - and after the young person is able to work with forces not
available to him before. With such insights as these provided by
anthroposophy, education ceases to be all arbitrary process of more or
less hit-or-miss methods and curricula of study, and becomes a conscious
effort to bring out the full potentialities of each individual child as
they are inherent at each particular age, by teaching always subjects
that belong to that age and in a manner suitable for it, and not for the
age he will have reached two or three years later. Not until about the
age of 21 does a young person receive his own I which is then freed for
his use, as the other bodies were freed at birth, 7 and 14. It is, of
course, possible to teach most children to read and write before the
change of teeth, but it is not desirable because forces have to be used
for reading and writing that have not yet become fully available for
their use. It is possible for children of eleven to acquire various
mathematical aptitudes before puberty which, according to Waldorf
pedagogy, should not be acquired until later. In the long run nothing
whatever is gained by trying to make use prematurely of these forces. It
is not in the least important at the age of 21 whether one learned to
read and write at the age of 5 or at the age of 7. What is important
then is one’s ability to read and write well and to possess a lively
intelligence unmarred by premature senes­cence. Children in Steiner
schools are always kept in the same class as others of their age group,
and are never allowed to skip a class because of their precocious
intellectual capacities. Many subjects, especially as taught in the
Steiner schools, possess relatively little intellectual content in the
sense that the children are not expected to understand them in the way
adults understand them. So it is possible to retain precociously
intellectual children in the same class as all others of the same age
without boring them; indeed, it is not at all unusual for such children
to be relatively backward in artistic work, and to experience
difficulties when they do eurythmy. If they are really good in all these
subjects and activities they will certainly be encouraged to help other
children who are less gifted than they, thus learning at an early age
that it is a privilege to possess such gifts, carrying with it the
responsibility to place them at the disposition of others.</p>
<p>In all respects Waldorf education is a general education, and at no
time during the twelve years or so spent at school do the children
specialize in any particular subject. Nor is there any competition
within the classes. Marks are not given; the teacher makes his own
evaluation of the children which is sent to their parents, who usually
discuss the report cards of their children with the teachers and with
the children themselves. The evaluation considers them in relation to
their own past performances and capacities, as the teacher sees them -
never in relation to other children. Parents who wish their children to
shine and outshine others so that they may bask in the glory reflected
on them by their children, receive no encouragement at Steiner schools;
nor are any prizes given. A teacher feels himself most successful if
there is a real solidarity among the members of his class and a true
social feeling, so that no trace of rivalry or competition shows
itself.</p>
<p>Even today all this is very different from what happens in most state
schools. In 1919 in Germany it was truly revolutionary, as was also the
mingling of children from different class backgrounds. In the first year
of the school about 150 children came from the working class, as we have
seen, their parents being employees of the tobacco factory, whose fees
were paid from the “gift-money” made available by Emil Molt from the
factory’s profits. The other fifty or sixty children came from the
middle or upper class, their parents being anthroposophists, very few of
whom at this time were from the working class. As time went on, and the
school won a very high reputation in Stuttgart, and even in Germany as a
whole, the student body began to increase rapidly. By 1928 there were
already more than a thousand children enrolled in the school, and more
than fifty teachers. The proportion of children from the working class
necessarily dropped with this increased enrollment since fees now had to
be charged, and except for the children of the Waldorf Astoria factory
workers, it was the parents who paid them. Indeed, little though this
was originally intended, wherever Steiner schools have come into being,
the student body has never been a true cross-section of society as
Steiner would have wished. Scholarships, full or partial, have ensured
that some children are enrolled whose parents come from the working
class. But they remain a small minority everywhere, and only the
original Waldorf School in Stuttgart has ever had the high proportion of
children from the working class that it had at its beginning in
1919.</p>
<p>Almost all the innovations that distinguish Waldorf from state
schools, and even from so-called “progressive” schools today are based
on Steiner’s perception of the child as a developing being with
different needs at different ages. Most modern Waldorf schools, unlike
the first school in Stuttgart at its founding, have kindergartens, and
some even have nursery schools. But no attempt is made in these schools
to teach the children anything with an intellectual content, as for
example reading and writing, because of the perception that the
pre-school child learns almost exclusively through imitation, and ought
to do so. In kindergarten and nursery school, therefore, the children
learn by doing, for example singing, dancing, making things with their
hands, leaving the development of the intellect to the first year in
primary school.</p>
<p>Examples of the adaptation of the school curriculum to the age of the
children could be multiplied indefinitely, and the interested reader is
referred to the many books on the Steiner schools and the kind of
education they offer, including a chapter by the present author in his
“Man and World in the Light of Anthroposophy”. Scarcely less interesting
to educators is the way the schools are administered in accordance with
Steiner’s belief that only those who take an active part in teaching
should be responsible for the school management. Almost all Steiner
schools have therefore established a College of Teachers, which is the
decision-making body and includes all fulltime teachers who are employed
on a regular basis. The College, at a minimum, will choose all new
faculty members, and usually makes itself responsible for all business
decisions, including the teachers’ salaries, the decision often being
made on the basis of the teacher’s need and responsibilities. The effort
is always made to make it clear to everyone that the salary paid is not
regarded as a compensation for work done, thus obeying the fundamental
rule enunciated by Rudolf Steiner that labor must never be regarded as a
commodity - one of the pillars of the Threefold Order as he explained
it. Very few indeed of the schools making use of Steiner’s educational
principles have ever had to be closed because of bad management or lack
of parental support. So perhaps it may be reasonably assumed that the
system of faculty management works, and that professional administrators
such as are to be found in all state school systems are not an absolute
necessity.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, a report exists in which a state school
inspector expressed his impressions of the original Waldorf School in
Stuttgart after it had been in operation for seven years, by which time
the student body had arisen to over a thousand, and was no longer
dependent on the largesse of Emil Molt, who paid only the fees of
children of the workers in his factory. This report was not made public,
but the inspector, F. Hartlieb, wrote an article based on his report,
and had it published in a Württemberg educational journal. It was later
translated into English and published. Throughout the article the
author, who was not an anthroposophist and had had no knowledge of
Anthroposophy before it became part of his official duties to report on
the Waldorf School, emphasizes how much the state system could learn
from it. Recognizing, as he said, that it was impossible to appreciate
the Waldorf School at its true value without some knowledge of Steiner’s
educational principles, he devoted much space in his report to a (very
accurate) explanation of some basic anthroposophical concepts; and how
they are reflected in the educational practice and in the curriculum of
the school. Most surprisingly for a professional educator, Hartlieb
lavished his praises on the Waldorf School teachers who came to the
school from many different walks of life, each contributing his special
talents to the whole.</p>
<p>“Without prejudice of any sort,” he wrote, “I must put on record the
fact that the College of Teachers with its high moral standard and
intellectual attainments gives the Waldorf School its peculiar stamp and
quality. A staff of teachers in such a close bond of union, working in
the same spirit and filled with the same warmth of enthusiasm, cannot
but bring their feeling of unity to daily expression. Each one serves
the other in love; each one radiates forces, to receive forces into
himself in return. . . Thus they grow together into an exemplary
community of life and work, such as deserves the highest recognition . .
. The Waldorf School has no Board of Governors empowered to inspect its
work. Nor does the time-table subject the individual to any kind of
narrowing restrictions. Unity among the teachers is ensured by the
teachers’ conferences, at which all-important questions are discussed in
detail, and which the teachers attend at the School - sometimes several
times a week and until late at night. . . . The children are warmly
attached to their teachers, both men and women, who, without recourse to
corporal punishment, train the soul and spirit of the boys and girls
entrusted to them by love, goodness, wisdom and example, more even than
by their enlightened methods of instruction. The teacher coming from a
State school is struck by the fact that greater freedom of movement is
allowed among the children of the Waldorf School than is generally the
case. . . . The right behavior of the children in the Waldorf School is
not regulated and one-sidedly enforced by an external discipline, but is
founded in the inner life, so as to grow spontaneously from within. . .
. The friendly spirit in the Waldorf School is beautifully revealed in
the monthly festival when all the pupils up to the twelfth form gather
with their teachers in the gymnasium, and follow with great interest the
musical and eurythmy performances. The presence of the parents, who come
in large numbers to all School gatherings, such as concerts, plays and
so on, outside the usual school-work, gives the festival a homelike
character. It also points clearly to the fact that parents, pupils and
teachers are closely associated with one another. Finally, it should be
pointed out that, in conformity with the natural family life, boys and
girls are taught together. The Waldorf School has established
co-education from the first form up to the twelfth and last class, and
has contrived to make the differentiation of the sexes in soul and
spirit serve the cause of education.48 [F. Hartlieb, The Free Waldorf
School at Stuttgart, London, 1928]</p>
<p>Almost everything that is done in present-day Steiner schools that
makes them distinctive originates from Rudolf Steiner himself. During
the few years that he was able to supervise the education personally he
proved to be a cornucopia of new ideas and suggestions. The school
festivals referred to by Herr Hartlieb remain today one of the
distinctive features of Steiner schools, as do the concerts, plays and
other performances by the students to which parents are invited. The
festivals, as may be supposed, stemmed from Steiner’s numerous lectures
on their significance, of which something will be said in Chapter 12.
For a long time after the founding of the first Waldorf School in
Stuttgart he attended in person as many of the faculty meetings as he
was able, and though they were held regularly every week he used to make
the journey from Dornach to Stuttgart for most of them. The teachers
used to call him “the teacher of the teachers,” and it was at these
meetings that he gave them some of his most fruitful suggestions. To
every question he was asked he gave an answer, and he played an active
part in all discussions.</p>
<p>Steiner, it appears, was also greatly loved by the children, and
during his sojourns in Stuttgart he visited as many classes as he could,
always with the consent of their teachers. Such visits were never looked
upon as inspections, and he never at any time permitted himself a word
of criticism of the teacher in the presence of the class. Sometimes, at
the teacher’s sugges­tion he would take over the class for the rest of
the period, giving an impromptu presentation which often proved of
immense benefit to the still not very experienced teacher. When he left
the classroom he liked to ask the children if they loved their teachers,
always to be met with the enthusiastic “yes” that he quite certainly
expected.</p>
<p>Many of the teachers used to make the not very long journey from
Stuttgart to Dornach at the weekends for the express purpose of asking
Rudolf Steiner yet another set of questions. In Dornach these men and
women brought a breath of fresh air to the somewhat hothouse atmosphere.
The first group of teachers, being drawn from many professions and
coming from all parts of the German-speaking world, included people who
had already won distinction elsewhere, though they were new to teaching.
They made a considerable impression in Dornach not only with their
questions but with their often brilliant talk. The members in Dornach,
many of whom had lived there since before the war, were devoted and
knowledgeable anthroposophists, but few of them could be considered men
and women of the world. Some of them resented the invasion by the
Stuttgart teachers and also the enthusiastic bands of young people who
were working in one capacity or another for the Threefold Social Order.
Some of the teachers and perhaps a majority of the young workers had a
relatively slight knowledge of Anthroposophy, which was found somewhat
shocking by many older members. Dornach had by this time become the real
center of Anthroposophy, but important work continued to be done in
other centers such as Stuttgart, Munich and Berlin, whose members were
loath to admit the new supremacy of Dornach resulting from the building
of the Goetheanum, and the work connected with it.</p>
<p>In addition to his numerous formal and informal talks to the
Stuttgart teachers, Rudolf Steiner soon began to give courses in
pedagogy elsewhere than in Stuttgart and Dornach. A Christmas
educational conference held in the Goetheanum in 1921 was the occasion
for visits of many foreign educators to Dornach, leading to further
invitations to lecture abroad, in the hope that similar Waldorf Schools
could be inaugurated outside Switzerland and Germany, The impulse
towards this education proved especially strong in England. Rudolf
Steiner was first invited to speak at an educational festival held in
April 1922 at Shakespeare’s birthplace, Stratford-on-Avon. He took the
opportunity not only to see about a dozen plays - he approved of the way
the comedies were presented, but had other ideas on the staging of the
tragedies - but also to give a lecture on Shakespeare himself and his
inspiration, as well as on education. His lectures were well reported in
the English press, and he was asked to deliver a whole course of
lectures later in the year at Manchester College, Oxford University.
These lectures were later published under the title The Spiritual Ground
of Education. Thus, as early as 1922, Steiner became well known in
English educational circles, and the movement to start another school on
the lines of the Waldorf School in Stuttgart made some headway.</p>
<p>Two further series of lectures on education were given in 1923
(Ilkley) and in 1924 (Torquay). By the time the second cycle was given
under the title of The Kingdom of Childhood it had been determined that
an English school would be founded. This was accomplished the following
year when the so-called New School in Streatham, a London suburb, came
into being. Later its name was changed to Michael Hall School; it still
exists, being located now at Forest Row in Sussex.</p>
<p>In 1923 a young married couple opened a Waldorf School in a private
house in The Hague in Holland, with ten pupils. Rudolf Steiner,
encouraged by the initiative, paid it a visit later in the year, and the
following year, when he visited Arnhem, Holland, for the last series of
lectures he was to give in that country, he found time in a very crowded
programme to give there a remarkable cycle of ten lectures, published
under the English title of “Human Values in Education”, in which he
spoke fervently about the future of all anthroposophical work in the
world, including education. So many new possibilities existed now, he
told his audience, that were not present before, and the spiritual world
was waiting to give new inspirations to mankind. The school in the Hague
survived and expanded, under a small group of very gifted teachers who
remained with it for decades; and though it was closed down by the Nazis
during the war, it was reopened immediately after their departure.
Several schools in other countries were opened during the next decade,
including the first school in the United States, the Rudolf Steiner
School in New York, opened in 1929.</p>
<p>Until World War II the Steiner school movement grew rather slowly, in
part because of financial stringencies, including the uncontrolled
inflation in Germany and Austria in the early 1920s, and the worldwide
depression of the l930s. The National Socialist regime in Germany closed
down all the Waldorf schools, including the parent school in Stuttgart,
for reasons that do credit to the schools rather than to the Nazis! They
claimed that the Waldorf schools were insufficiently nationalistic (as
they said also unceasingly about Rudolf Steiner himself whom they
regarded as an implacable enemy of their party), and, worse still, the
schools had as their aim the development of free individualities.
Naturally they could scarcely defend themselves against such charges, of
which they were obviously guilty, and proud of the fact. But they had
their reward after the Nazi regime was overthrown when the British and
United States’ military governments did all they could to help them back
into operation, for precisely the same reason that they had been
suppressed by the Third Reich.</p>
<p>In spite of the shortage of materials and bombed out buildings, the
schools soon recovered their position as by far the largest private
educational system in Germany. The Nazi authorities allowed two of the
three Dutch schools to remain open, and of course Switzerland and Sweden
as neutrals were unaffected by the Nazi tyranny, except for the
financial stringencies engendered by the war itself and the shortages
from which they suffered. In Great Britain, curiously enough, all the
major schools were founded already before the war and continued to
operate during it; and it was not until very recent times that the
movement in Britain began to add more schools. The leading school had to
be evacuated far from London during the war.</p>
<p>By 1952 there were 65 schools operating throughout the world, though
several of these were small and struggling, and not all did in fact
survive into the next decade. But with the 1960s the movement began a
considerable expansion, the end of which is by no means in sight. It is
difficult to state with any accuracy just how many Waldorf and Steiner
schools are now in 1980 in operation, in part because some of the more
recent schools may not be using all the elements of Steiner education
used by the older and better established schools. There is no system of
accreditation, and a school that likes to call itself a Steiner school
will always be given the benefit of the doubt by its elders. Certainly
there are more than 150 Steiner schools now in operation [there are now
(2005) around 800 – Ed.], making it the largest group of private schools
in the world following the same educational principles. Indeed, there is
no educational movement with a foothold in all five (or six) continents
that can be compared with it.</p>
<p>As a consequence, it is mainly because of Rudolf Steiner’s
contributions to education that he is known to the world today. But
probably very few people indeed are aware that the first school in
Stuttgart on which all others have been modelled, arose from the
positive wish of its founder Emil Molt to make a first step forward
toward the “Threefold Society”, by establishing a new kind of school in
the spiritual/cultural domain, which would be a free and unitary
co-educational school of a kind that was entirely unique in its time.
Even today, sixty years later, the same may be said of the network of
Steiner schools throughout the world, even though some elements or
Steiner education have indeed been taken over by others, usually without
acknowledgement. Few, if any, of these schools would deny today that
they owe almost everything to the educational impulse given by their
original founder, Rudolf Steiner, whose lectures on education remain the
basis for every Waldorf teacher training course given anywhere
through­out the world.</p>
