<h3>Reincarnation Blues – Canto I</h3>
</header>

<main style="display:flex;flex-direction:column;align-items:center">
<div>
<p class="intropoem">Twas a distant dance ago,<br />
More real than a writer's rhyme,<br />
Longer than you'll ever know,<br />
Little to do with what's called time.</p>
<p>If a century or two is time at all,<br />
Then dream of it before you go,<br />
Then dance to it spring and fall,<br />
For when you go you'll never know.</p>
<p>You think there's nothing at all to lose.<br />
You better think again, baby,<br />
And heed the Reincarnation Blues:<br />
That death's a-dawning and that ain't maybe.</p>
<p>It all depends on certain stuff<br />
You did or didn't do this time,<br />
Being good is not enough<br />
Nor partaking of Bread and Wine.</p>
<p>Is there time still to repent<br />
For all the bad you did to others?<br />
For all the gifts to yourself you sent<br />
Instead of your sisters and your brothers?</p>
<p>It still depends on all the stuff<br />
You did or didn't do last time:<br />
Being good is not enough<br />
If love in life is left behind.</p>
<p>You think there's nothing at all to lose.<br />
You better think again, baby,<br />
And heed the Reincarnation Blues:<br />
That death's a-dawning and that ain't maybe.</p>
<h3>Reincarnation Blues – Canto II</h3>
<p class="intropoem">I'd really like again to live<br />
Not this long, but longer still.<br />
Would I then have more to give<br />
With more to feel but weaker will?</p>
<p>There was a time in northern climes<br />
When I thought and felt and sought<br />
And willed, but failed in troubled times;<br />
And countless were the lies I bought.</p>
<p>Then in seasons southern born<br />
Fluttered the spirit's broken wing,<br />
Or was it an angel in female form<br />
Whose beauty made the cosmos sing?</p>
<p>When I ask myself what<br />
I'm doing here I shake my head.<br />
It's neither cold here nor hot,<br />
The feeling I have is one of dread.</p>
<p>For what if I'd traveled so long and far<br />
With little to show than a belly pot?<br />
Well, but I loved and went to war<br />
The war was won, the love was not.</p>
<p>You think it depends on what you choose.<br />
You better think again, baby<br />
And heed the Reincarnation Blues:<br />
Fate does the choosing, and I don't mean maybe.</p>
<h3>Reincarnation Blues – Canto III</h3>
<p class="intropoem">A picture of Evita wreathed in flowers<br />
Adorns the bus's runny windshield.<br />
The driver in his mirror glowers<br />
At the Pampa's wind-blown field.</p>
<p>A line of passengers waits to board,<br />
School kids, tired workers poor.<br />
And there she is, praise the Lord,<br />
To salve my soul, evermore.</p>
<p>Sure, on a teacher's miserable salary<br />
She's poor like the rest, but not as poor<br />
in the soul, or mind if you prefer contrarily,<br />
But she'll now be poor nevermore.</p>
<p>The seat she takes is next to mine.<br />
she opens a copybook to correct the errors<br />
In ink-blotted papers one at a time,<br />
Trying to make sense of the leaning letters.</p>
<p>I little doubt we've known each other<br />
In a past paradise-like life:<br />
As a brother, lover or even mother,<br />
Either of these would define my delight.</p>
<p>I ask – although I already knew --<br />
If she was a teacher in a country school.<br />
The question to her was hardly new:<br />
She nods politely, though kinda cool.</p>
<p>“In the next town”, as she erasing rubs,<br />
Leaving little time to make my pitch:<br />
<em>Come live with me and be my love</em><br />
I quote as we roll around a ditch.</p>
<p>She stands and smiles a smile so fair:<br />
“My English is not so good,” she says.<br />
Once outside in the dusty square<br />
To a big guy's kiss she answers yes.</p>
<p>And pointing at my balding dome,<br />
The old lecher still seated here,<br />
Who propositioned her with a poem.<br />
They laugh out loud and rude, I fear.</p>
<p>Let me give you a piece of advice<br />
If it's not already too late to choose.<br />
As a lesson I can't be more concise:<br />
Give heed to the Reincarnation Blues.</p>
