What the hell, Jacks thought, it’s lunch time, how can they be closed. Something’s wrong. He peered through the glass and saw the old waiter  sitting  alone  at  a  table  reading  the  Freie  Presse,  a  fascist  German- language  daily.  He  knocked  on  the  window.  The  waiter  looked  up,  startled and stared wide-eyed at the door. When he recognized Marvin Jacks he put down  the  paper,  smiled,  stood  up  heavily  and  opened  the  door  after unlocking it.",

Jacks  remained  standing  while  the  waiter hurried  into  the  kitchen  and  returned  immediately  clutching  a  piece  of notebook  paper.  He  smiled.  “They  let  her  write  it  when  she  said  it  was instructions for picking up her daughter at school. They told me to translate it. They are really stupid, because if it was for me, which she said it was, why would she have to write it out. Anyway, here it is.” Jacks read it.  Herr Jacks, Bitte, holen Sie meine Tochter von der Schule ab, um ein-uhr: Rudolf-Steiner- Schule, Warnes 1331. She signed it: Marie Clement",

        description: [
          "During World War II, American leaders proudly proclaimed this country the “arsenal of democracy,” supplying weapons and related materiel to allies like Great Britain and the Soviet Union. To cite just one example, I recall reading about Soviet armored units equipped with U.S. Sherman tanks, though the Soviets had an even better tank of their own in the T-34 and its many variants. However, recent news that the United States is providing yet more massive arms deliveries to Israel (worth $20 billion) for 2026 and thereafter caught me off guard.  Israel quite plainly is engaged in the near-total destruction of Gaza and the massacre of Palestinians there.  So, tell me, how over all these years did the self-styled arsenal of democracy become an arsenal of genocide?",
          "Israel, after all, couldn’t demolish Gaza, killing at least 40,000 Palestinians in a population of only 2.1 million, including thousands of babies and infants, without massive infusions of U.S. weaponry. Often, the U.S. doesn’t even sell the weaponry to Israel, a rich country that can pay its own bills. Congress just freely gifts body- and baby-shredding bombs in the name of defending Israel from Hamas. Obviously, by hook or crook, or rather by shells, bombs, and missiles, Israel is intent on rendering Gaza Palestinian-free and granting Israelis more living space there (and on the West Bank). That’s not “defense” — it’s the 2024 equivalent of Old Testament-style vengeance by annihilation.",

In my case, it’s a tough one for a few reasons, the biggest being that I’m an avowed pacifist who believes that war is a crime against humanity, a failure of the imagination, and never (no, not ever) necessary. Along with the rest of my family of five, I live below the taxable income level. That way, we don’t pay into a system that funds war preparations and war-making. We have to be a little creative to make our money stretch further and we don’t eat out or go to the movies every week. But we don’t ever feel deprived as a result. In essence, I’ve traded career success and workplace achievement for a slightly clearer conscience and time — time to work to end militarism and break our collective addiction!",

          "I have spoken to you about the historical origin of what today may be called imperialism, and you will have already noticed from what I said yesterday that it is essential to see how contemporary occurrences, which were once real factors in social life, are now merely leftovers from older times as far as reality is concerned. In olden times institutions and customs had their real meaning. To a certain extent they were realities. Realty has ended though. After passing through the stage of symbols, it has finally become a platitude.",
          "	In general we live in the age of platitudes. It is necessary, however, to realize that platitudes need a certain soil from which to grow, and on the other hand they are a preparation for something which is yet to come in human evolution. If the old realities had not transformed themselves into platitudes, that is, into something existing yet illusional, then the new reality could not come into being. The new could not come if for example a visible god appeared in human form as happened in the last years of the Roman empire. For the Roman emperors were, at least according to their pretensions, still gods. Nero, at least hypothetically, was a real god in human form. In the course of time such things have lost their meaning. They have passed through the stage of symbols and have become mere platitudes.",
          "	But the more things become platitudes, the more the terrain is prepared for a new reality – a spiritual life which is not derived from the sensible world, but from the super-sensible world; for a spiritual life which does not seek the divine-spiritual beings in human form, but as real, genuine beings amongst the visible people on earth. First must come the age of platitudes which must, however, be recognized as such. Then the development of a new spiritual life will be possible. In order to understand the contemporary world under such disagreeable conditions, one must direct one's attention toward the birth of a new spiritual life, fully conscious of the illusionary nature of what was formerly reality in human evolution.",

There was a sliver of moon in the sky now, but it provided little light. The forest was very different at night than it was during the day and not only because they could hardly see.

It happens to be a wedding I'd give a lot to be able to get to, and when the invitation first arrived, I thought it might just be possible for me to make the trip abroad, by plane, expenses be hanged. However, I've since discussed the matter rather extensively with my wife, a breathtakingly levelheaded girl, and we've decided against it--for one thing, I'd completely forgotten that my mother-in-law is looking forward to spending the last two weeks in April with us. I really don't get to see Mother Grencher terribly often, and she's not getting any younger. She's fifty-eight. (As she'd be the first to admit.)",

Accordingly, I've gone ahead and jotted down a few revealing notes on the bride as I knew her almost six years ago. If my notes should cause the groom, whom I haven't met, an uneasy moment or two, so much the better. Nobody's aiming to please, here. More, really, to edify, to instruct.",

We were all essentially letter-writing types, and when we spoke to each other out of the line of duty, it was usually to ask somebody if he had any ink he wasn't using. When we weren't writing letters or attending classes, each of us went pretty much his own way. Mine usually led me, on clear days, in scenic circles around the countryside. Rainy days, I generally sat in a dry place and read a book, often just an axe length away from a ping-pong table.",

Pete was a poet, a profession not very amenable to earning money, so he moonlighted as an assistant insurance underwriter at Encore Underwriters, Inc., 66 Wall Street, New York City, which is where I met him.",

Getting something published in that magazine was enough to win Brooklyn’s 3-B (Best Breast-Beating) Gold Medal, so Peter Product’s reputation went into orbit. Simon and Schuster approached him directly (he had no agent yet) for a book of his poems. S & S knew that they would gain no profit, but publishing poetry is good for a publishing house’s reputation. Pete had a pendrive full of his life’s work, none of which, by the way, approached the poetic quality and heartfelt metaphoric feeling of “Ode”. He sent it all to   S & S, who edited it as best they could and issued it with the title Ode to the Brooklyn Bridge – and other verses by Peter Product.",

His girlfriend – María, a dark-haired Argentine beauty – worked as a secretary at Encore, actually my secretary. I was a licensed insurance underwriter, Peter Product was one of my assistants. My section was growing and making a lot of money. Most of the other sections used the secretary pool, but I had the most important places in the country to cover: New York City and Kentucky. The importance of NYC is obvious, but Kentucky? It’s the whisky, stupid. Whisky distilleries were and probably still are great fire risks, and their contents valuable. So risky and so valuable that no insurance company would dare to cover them alone. That’s where Encore Underwriters came in. We would distribute the risk over various companies, even including Lloyd’s of London. The latter, the biggest insurance company in the world, would automatically accept fifty percent of any risk if our American companies combined would take the other fifty percent."

          'Most favela dwellers come from the north, from Bahia, Pernambuco, Ceará, Minas Gerais. Many from still farther away. Most find it a thousand times better here then there, even if they must live in a favela. "Here at least we eat. There you plant in the scorching heat and then comes the harvest. You harvest, but the buyer pays a miserable sum." Or: "You plant, it doesn\'t rain, the crop is ruined." "We suffered there, and when the harvest brought nothing in I swore never to plant again; two days later we left with our belongings and children, a two-day bus trip." That\'s not so much though; most leave by train, which takes up to ten days, depending on the distance.',
          'They usually leave their traditions and customs behind. Once in Sao Paulo they seldom dance the quadrilla, hardly any folk-songs are sung; bumba meu moi (meu boi: "my ox", a kind of religious theatre and procession) or Folia dos Reis (a musical play about the Three Wise Men), are hardly ever performed. Many are ashamed of these things and think that in the city they must be "modern" and sing, dance and celebrate differently. That\'s why life in the favela, almost everywhere in the city in fact, is so barren and monotonously gray. But that\'s also why most of them still harbor a silent nostalgia for their "terra", and many want to go back when they\'re old to live in peace on their savings.',

          "I roved around for a while in Brooklyn, had a couple of jobs delivering newspapers (The Brooklyn Eagle) and meat and vegetables (Abe & Ben's Kosher Market), but finally decided I should get more serious, so looked up the help wanted ads in the newspapers. An employment agency sent me to an insurance company to apply for a job as “assistant underwriter.” Besides not knowing anything about insurance, I didn't even know what an “underwriter” is, except that it sounds like underwater. I asked the employment agency guy, but he didn't know either. He told me not to worry about it, that the General Cover company was desperate for a young white All-American male, relatively intelligent, with a high school education, no experience necessary, assistant underwriter trainee, and I filled the bill, at least according to him. “They'll tell you what an underwriter is, and you can tell me.”",
          "General Cover Underwriters occupied a whole floor in a skyscraper on Wall Street. I was interviewed first by a vice- president, then by a supervisor named George Fellows, who asked me three easy questions and told me I was hired, starting immediately. He turned me over to Bob, who shook hands and sat me, almost physically, at “my” desk, complete with swivel chair, blotter, telephone and a device I couldn't identify. It turned out to be a voice recorder that I used to write letters. Once a few letters were recorded, I ejected the recording and carried it down to the other end of the floor to the typing pool occupied by a dozen or so women, mostly young, because female ambition those days seldom amounted to more than getting married and staying home to mind the children.",

Judith is a loyal communist, and does as she is told, and does her spying well.",

He is then sent to Germany and asigned to Military Intelligence, where German linguists are needed, not Russian ones. Marvin, the other book-end, is a loyal American, but not much of a spy.",
