<p class="intro">On the last day of the first month of the second year of the reign of
Solon, I and others of this house mourned the death of our
<em>kurios</em>, Jadmon. He was a good man. He treated everyone in his
charge well, whether they were free or enslaved.</p>
<p>On the day of his passing, we gathered in his room, as he had asked.
He spoke to us one by one, giving each of us advice by which to remember
him. Jadmon was a wise man. He gave us wise counsel.</p>
<p>Aesopos was the only slave standing by his death bed. Jadmon often
relied on his advice. It seemed only fitting that he would want to say
goodbye to Aesopos before he left this world. We did not know that he
had something more to say.</p>
<p>“Aesopos, come close. And you...,” he said to me, “you come close as
well. I want you to be a witness to what I am about to do.”</p>
<p>I did as I was bidden. I was curious.</p>
<p>“Aesopos,” Jadmon said, “you have been a faithful servant, advisor
and confidant to me for all these years.”</p>
<p>Aesopos lowered his head respectfully.</p>
<p>“Because of that, I proclaim that from this day forward, and for all
the days of your life, you are and will ever be a free man. I only ask
that you share your wisdom with all the people as you have with me.”</p>
<p>Aesopos stood silent. It had always been his habit never to allow his
face to show his joy, sadness, anger or compassion. But I could see joy
in his face even as he tried to hide it. If Jadmon had been standing, I
suspect Aesopos would have embraced his knees in a final show of respect
and humility. Instead, he opened his mouth, searching for words.</p>
<p>“<em>Evkharisto.” </em>he said,”<em>Evkharisto para poli.</em>”</p>
<p>Aesopos looked at me. There was a question on his face, one that was
all the more clear because he had not spoken it aloud.</p>
<p>“<em>Why am I thanking him?“</em></p>
<p>And with that, Jadmon closed his eyes and began his journey to the
next life. First, the chanters sang their mourning songs, then the songs
gave way to silent respect. I approached his body, placed coins on his
eyes and a payment to Charon in his mouth to ensure that his passage to
the next world would be unhindered. The women of the house then came
into the room to wash his body and wrap him in a white shroud.</p>
<p>Aesopos and I walked out of the room and into the fading light of the
dusk. The other men bore Jadmon’s body to a place where a funeral pyre
was being built.</p>
<p>“You are a free man, Aesopos.” I said.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“What will you do now?”</p>
<p>He looked out to the hills in the distance and shaded his eyes from
the sun.</p>
<p>“I’ve never been on the other side of those hills.” he said. “I’ll go
there.”</p>
<p>He walked away from the house tentatively and stopped when he saw a
boy sitting alongside the footpath with his hands held together, light
seeping though his closed fingers. He laughed and opened his hands and
out came a firefly. Aesopos watched it fly toward the hills until its
light faded.</p>
<p>The next day, Aesopos gathered his belongings and set off for the
other side of the hills. I watched him as he walked away. Perhaps it was
the distance, but his gait, while as slow as it ever was, seemed more
assured. His back, normally bent like a twig, grew straight. He was
still crippled, as he had been all his life, but he moved with more
purpose than I had ever seen. After he disappeared around a bend in the
road, I did not see him again until he returned from his journey. When
he did, he told me this story.</p>
<p>On his first full day of freedom, Aesopos started down a worn path
and walked until dusk. By the end of the day, he had reached the far
side of the hills. He looked back on the path and could not see the
house he had come from or the town where he had lived. He looked up and
saw a tern flying overhead. He had seen many terns in the past. Jadmon’s
house was near the sea. But he had not expected to see a tern so far
inland and he wondered where it was going. But it did not matter. It was
airborne and that was all that mattered.</p>

<p>He grew tired from his journey, so he found a spot in a field of
grass and lay down. The green, the breeze and the quiet lulled him
toward sleep. But as darkness fell, he felt a terror he had never known
before. He was gripped by the sounds made by creatures he could not see.
He wanted to get to his feet, but he could not move. He shut his eyes
tight, curled himself into a tight ball and tried not to hear the sounds
around him. After a long while, he fell asleep.</p>

<p>He dreamed he was flying. He had become the tern he had seen flying
over him earlier. The ribbons of green below him and the bright expanse
of the ocean made him feel as large as the sky itself. But he felt that
at any moment his wings might fail, and he would go down into the sea
like Icarus. He felt himself falling from a great height and a terrible
fear pulled him awake and sat him upright.</p>
<p>By then, the morning sun was rising from behind the hills. He rose to
his feet, started down the footpath and came to a place where it
branched into many smaller paths. He stood for a moment and looked
ahead. On one side, the paths led between the hills. On the other, many
paths led across the open land to the sea. He decided to walk between
the hills. He had once called these hills “the walls of my prison,
nothing more.” But now they felt like the walls of a great house and the
space between them felt safe.</p>
<p>He walked past several small houses. There were kitchen gardens
alongside the houses where women tended herbs, vegetables and flowers of
many colors. Aesopos stopped at one of the houses and bought olives from
a kind woman. She smiled and wished him a good day. He thanked her
respectfully. He had become a traveller, maybe even a god in disguise.
It was a strange feeling but pleasing nevertheless. Still, he told no
one he was a former slave.</p>
<p>He stopped to look up at the sky. He felt its breadth and immensity
in the pit of his stomach. He moved on, but he strayed from the path and
walked the fields. After a while, he came to a stand of trees and sat
down on the ground. He could hear the sound of birds and looked upward
to find them. It was then he spotted a sparrow on a branch above him.
The sparrow was building a nest while a jay hovered close by, coveting
the place where the sparrow was building. Aesopos listened to the chirps
and squawks of both birds and imagined their conversation.</p>
<p>“This is a fine place for a nest.” said the jay.</p>
<p>“I agree,” said he sparrow. “That’s why I’m building my nest here.
And jays are not allowed!”</p>
<p>“Ha!” said the jay. “I can tear you limb from limb!”</p>
<p>“And I can bring about forces you could never see or imagine and
drive you into the ground!”</p>
<p>And the sparrow chattered long and loud. The jay, never having heard
such a noise from such a small creature, stepped back. He stood his
ground for a moment, then flew away.</p>
<p>Aesopos smiled.</p>
<p>“It isn’t always the biggest and strongest who prevail.” he said to
the sparrow and to himself. “Sometimes it is the one with the biggest
heart. And sometimes even that is not enough.”</p>
<p>He sat down alongside the path when he saw a raven foraging through
the grass. Out of its sight, a cat crawled toward it, its tail twitching
and its eyes wide open. Suddenly, the cat pounced on the raven, who
cried out and jabbed the cat’s face with its beak. But it was too late.
The cat killed the raven and ran off with his prize. But then a hawk
appeared and snatched the raven from the cat’s jaws. Off it flew. The
cat watched it vanish into the sky with something like shame.</p>
<p>“Hmmm...” Aesopos thought to himself. “It seems that the animals have
as many stories to tell about themselves as they do about people.”</p>
<p>Aesopos set off again. All around him were the imprints of people,
evidence that someone lived nearby even if he could not see them. Rows
of olive trees stood like sentinels. Patches of flowers grew around
houses suggesting their owners sought the company of passing strangers.
He thought about knocking on someone’s door, sure that they would see
him as a god visiting in disguise. But that seemed wrong somehow.
Aesopos never was one for deceit.</p>
<p>He came upon a house where children were playing. He saw, too, that
there was a fledgling on the ground spinning in circles on its tiny
wings, unable to fly. Out of the shadows, a cat came closer, seeing easy
prey.</p>
<p>A girl of about seven saw the fledgling and the cat and ran toward
them.</p>
<p>“<em>Ohi, ohi, ohi!</em>” she cried, running after the cat and
pushing it away with her hands. “<em>Shoo!“</em></p>
<p>Then she picked up the fledgling in her hands and held it close to
her heart.<br />
“You know, the bird can’t survive without its mother.” Aesopos said to
the girl.</p>
<p>“I know how to feed him.” she said. “I’ve done it before.”</p>
<p>“So, you will care for it until it is strong enough to fly, then you
will set it free?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know.” she said. “He’s very sweet and the woods have so much
bad in them.”</p>
<p>Aesopos thought for a moment about what to say to the girl. This bird
could be as free as he was. But it also could find itself in the jaws of
a cat. Or it could spend its life in the care of this girl, safe but not
free. Which fate would the bird choose if it could choose?</p>
<p>“When the bird can fly,” said Aesopos, “give it a chance to fly
away.”</p>
<p>“I could never do that.” she said.</p>
<p>“If the bird stays, you have a friend. If it flies away, it has found
its freedom. And you have helped it. Do you see?”</p>
<p>The girl slowly nodded. She looked up to the trees to to see if the
fledgling’s mother was nearby. She saw no other birds and carefully held
the fledgling.</p>
<p>Aesopos walked on, following a path that led to a scattering of
houses. He came upon a fallen tree, sat down and stretched out his
legs.</p>
<p>It was then that he noticed a cat had been following him. The cat was
a deep grey with bright green eyes. Aesopos leaned over and reached out
his hand.</p>
<p>“<em>Po, po, po, po</em>...,” he whispered.</p>
<p>When the cat came closer, Aesopos realized that this was the same one
the girl had chased away from the fledgling. He sat still and waited for
the cat to come closer to him. The cat sniffed the hem of his robe and
played with the loose threads that hung to the ground. It rubbed
Aesopos’ sandal with the corner of its mouth, sat back on its hind legs
and jumped into Aesopos’ lap. Then it stood up on all four legs and
climbed up his arm. Aesopos smiled and the cat settled onto his
shoulders, purring and shifting its weight.</p>
<p>“You are a creature of many faces, my friend.” said Aesopos. “You can
be kind and cruel. You can hunt an innocent fledgling as easily as you
can comfort an old man. You can kill to survive and still live the
highest life. I have often told stories about you, about your cruel and
devious nature. But that is not your story, is it?”</p>
<p>Aesopos sat with the cat on his shoulders until a mouse scurried
across the path in front of them. The cat jumped from his shoulders in
pursuit the mouse. They both ran into the tall grass, where Aesopos
could no longer see them.</p>
<p>Aesopos roamed the land behind the hills for days. He wandered
through the woods and fields, walked beside the rivers and streams, met
the people and the animals and came to know them.</p>

<p>He walked across an open field between a stand of olive trees and a
fast-running stream. He shaded his eyes from the sun and looked down. On
the ground were feathers scattered around him, each the size of his
forefinger. He walked further and saw more feathers from the same bird
alongside smaller feathers from another bird. He could see a story being
told.</p>

<p>He recognized some of the feathers as those of a hawk. In his
imagination, he could see the hawk hunting a large bird, perhaps a goose
or a duck, and attacking it. Then, in a deep patch of grass, Aesopos saw
the hawk lying dead, its head turned and its neck broken. Near it there
were webbed footprints in the ground. The distance between them grew
longer before they disappeared completely, telling the tale of the
hawk’s prey escaping with its life. At first, Aesopos smiled at the
thought of the hawk losing both its prey and its own life. But he looked
again at the hawk, its eyes still open, and placed his hand over his
heart and bowed his head.</p>
<p>He took to the path again and came to a place where the land spread
wide, and the deep blue Aegean spanned the horizon. He looked back at
the hills and thought of a time long ago when, as a boy, he sat atop a
cliff with an old man who waited for dolphins to appear on the waves and
remind him how it felt to be young and to discover the world for the
first time. At the time, Aesopos did not understand what the old man was
trying to recapture. But now he felt it in his bones.</p>
<p>He came to a shoreline, stopped where the sea met the land and let
the incoming waves wash over his feet. He looked back to the hills where
he had found safety. Then he turned and looked out to sea and felt the
wind in his hair. It was then he realized he was no longer afraid of the
wide-open spaces. The hills had guided him and kept him safe. But now he
felt he could leave them.</p>
<p>I saw Aesopos when he came back to Jadmon’s house.</p>
<p>“How are you, my friend?” I said, grabbing hold of his shoulders.</p>
<p>“I am well,” he said. “And I know much more now than I did
before.”</p>
<p>“What have you learned?”</p>
<p>“I learned about the world and the souls within it. I’ve always used
them as the stuff out of which I fashioned my stories. But I found out
that they are themselves stories, told in their own voices and written
in the land itself, stories about freedom, all its wonders and dangers.
It is not to be feared, only known. And I learned about Aesopos.”</p>
<p>“Aesopos?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Aesopos has a story to live, too.”</p>
<p>“What will you do now?” I asked.</p>
<p>“I will go somewhere I have never been and see it as a free man.”</p>
<p>Then he told me the story I have just related. The next day, he set
off for the harbor to find a ship to take him away. I never saw him
after that. I often wonder what became of him.</p>

<p>Paul Holler has been a writer of short stories, poems, articles and
interviews with noted authors for many years. His work has appeared in
<em>Southern Cross Review, The MacGuffin, Flash, Freshwater Literary
Journal, Write City Review, Ekphrastic Review, The Phare, Eclectica
</em>and other journals.</p>
<p>From the time I was a child, I’ve been drawn to Aesop’s fables. I
liked the humor, the wisdom far beyond my own and the subversive way he
used animals to show people a mirror of themselves while he entertained
them. I still do.</p>
<p style="font-style:italic">About 15 years ago, I became interested in writing stories about
Aesop’s life. Not much is known about his life. Some scholars doubt that
he existed at all. It seemed right that stories about his life should be
fictional, so I began writing them as fiction.</p>
<p style="font-style:italic">I usually refer to these stories as my Aesop Project, but it’s less
formal than that. Sometimes I begin with a fable and imagine how it may
have come to be written. Other stories in the project come from my own
experience. Each story is told by a different narrator. These have
included a merchant, a sailor, a woman of the upper classes, a man
remembering his boyhood, a councilman, a man employed by a wealthy
landowner and Aesop himself.</p>
<p style="font-style:italic">Writing these stories has reacquainted me with the fables and allowed
me to see them in a new light. I feel I’ve learned a few things along
the way. I hope readers have, too.</p>
