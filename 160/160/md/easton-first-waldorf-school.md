# The Founding of the First Waldorf School

### Chapter 10 of “Rudolf Steiner: Herald of a New Epoch”

## by Stewart Easton
 
In earlier chapters of this book it was shown how when quite a
young man Rudolf Steiner interested himself in education. While he was
still at school he tutored fellow-pupils of his own age and younger;
when he was at the Vienna Institute of Technology he eked out his
meager scholarship funds by tutoring, and then for several years he
was responsible for the education of a severely handicapped boy, who
was eventually able to become entirely normal and qualify as a doctor.
In view of what has been said in this book about Steiner's
extraordinary capacity for observation, and his intuitive grasp of
what lies behind the perceptible world, it will be readily appreciated
that in all his youthful educational work he was constantly learning
from his experience, and observing how human beings develop and change
during childhood. It is, therefore, not surprising that as soon as he
had a magazine at his disposal in which he could say what he wanted,
he began to write educational articles, little though these may
perhaps have been appreciated in the last years of the nineteenth
century by the rather critical subscribers to the Berlin Magazine for
Literature. Even at this time he took the position that it was the
primary task of the teacher to awaken abilities in his students, and
not to stuff them with knowledge, or "transmit to them our own
convictions."

When a few years later he founded the magazine Luzifer-Gnosis whose
subscribers knew that their magazine would be a vehicle for Rudolf
Steiner's ideas in every field, it was also natural for him to revert
fairly often to social and educational questions in which he was
vitally interested. The articles on the social order written for
Luzifer-Gnosis in 1905 and 1906 necessarily lacked those ideas which
he was later to describe in such detail, because, as we have seen,
Steiner was not yet ready to speak of the threefold nature of man and
so could not speak of the threefold nature of society. But in his
fundamental educational lecture first given in 1907 and then
personally revised for publication, after having been given in a
slightly different form to many different audiences, he was already
able to enunciate all the major educational principles later used in
his educational work. In this lecture called The Education of the
Child in the Light of Theosophy (or Anthroposophy) Steiner explains
how a child in the first seven years of his life until the change of
teeth lives in his will forces and learns by imitation, never by
precept; how from the change of teeth to puberty (from the age of 7 to
14) he lives in the element of feeling, making it necessary for his
studies to be saturated with artistic feeling, and therefore for him
to be guided by a teacher with whom he should develop a relationship
of love as well as respect; and how only at puberty can he really
begin to think independently as his intellect for the first time
becomes free. Human willing, feeling, and thinking thus follow each
other in time, as first the physical, then the etheric and astral
bodies, are successively developed until the young person at last
acquires his own earthly I or ego at the age of about 21.

The entire educational programme of the Waldorf School at Stuttgart
and subsequent schools either bearing this name, or called Steiner
schools after the name of their originator, or after other
personalities or higher beings to whom the school founders feel
related, was already implicit in this lecture; and it would almost be
possible to deduce an educational programme from it. Everything in
Steiner education is based upon the child and his development, and not
at all on the supposed needs of society. Thus the word "education,"
which in Latin means "leading forth" may truly be applied to this form
of education, as distinct from the word "learning" which is more
properly applied to most educational systems. In this lecture also
first appears, most significantly, a passage in which Steiner voices
his confident hope that some day he will be asked to take the lead in
bringing his educational ideas to realization. "These things," he
writes, "can of course only be touched on here, but in future
Anthroposophy will be called upon to give the necessary indications,
and this it is in a position to do. For it is no empty abstraction but
a body of living facts which can give guiding lines for the conduct of
life's realities."

Twelve years had passed before Steiner was at last given the
opportunity to put his educational ideas into operation. As a result
of his first lecture to the workers in Emil Molt's tobacco factory he
was asked by them how the next generation could grow up free from the
cultural deprivation from which they themselves had suffered. He
immediately responded positively to the question and its implied
request; and even before a full week had gone by after his lecture, he
was already meeting for practical educational discussions with Emil
Molt and two other anthroposophists, both of whom were to play a
leading part in the school, and one of whom had been very active in
the Threefold Movement from the beginning. The discussion, which was
very wide-ranging, naturally turned upon the cultural realm of the
Threefold Social Order, and on the necessity for new cultural
impulses. But Steiner also spoke at length about how necessary it was
for industrial workers to become aware of the world outside the field
of their own specialized work, and to win back the dignity of which
they had been robbed when first they came to be regarded virtually as
interchangeable parts in the industrial system.

Up to this time Emil Molt, who was a strongly paternalistic employer,
genuinely interested in the welfare of his employees, had been
offering extension courses in various subjects to the workers. But
they had excited relatively little interest, and he was thinking
already of abandoning them for lack of support. But from the beginning
the workers were fired with enthusiasm for the idea of a totally
different kind of school for their children, and Molt, who was already
a leader in the Threefold movement, immediately expressed himself as
ready to devote the profits of his enterprise as "gift-money" for this
new cultural venture. After numerous discussions Steiner agreed to
become what he called the "guide and spiritual adviser" of the school,
whereupon Molt bought a downtown restaurant which he proceeded to have
remodeled as a school. The prospective student body for the opening,
which was planned for September in the same year, consisted of the
workers' children, about a hundred and fifty in all, to which were
quickly added the children of the Stuttgart anthroposophists,
approximately fifty in number, and coming almost entirely from a
different class from their new fellow-students. Thus the school was
planned from the beginning to include all grades up to the twelfth. A
complete educational programme therefore had to be offered, which
would include the classes in the various arts that Steiner considered
essential, and teachers had to be found for all of them. Perhaps
fortunately, a few professional educators, who were also
anthroposophists, were available with the necessary teaching
experience. But the vast bulk of the teachers were chosen by Steiner
himself from volunteers from every walk of life who wished to take
part in the epoch-making experiment, and who were already familiar
with Anthroposophy and competent in the subjects they would be
teaching. Many of these men and women left their existing employment
to work with him in this venture; and it is probable that such a group
of dedicated and gifted teachers has never been assembled before or
since at the beginning of any school in history.

Obviously, the first task was to train them, both as teachers, and as
pioneers in a new form of education. All Steiner schools, including
this first one, are run by their faculty. For this reason it would be
necessary for the teachers to learn how to work together as a team in
a spirit of harmony in spite of the absence of any overall authority.
At the beginning, instead of having such an authority over them they
possessed a "guide and spiritual adviser" in whom they all had
absolute confi­dence, and he in turn had confidence in them because
they had all been handpicked by him. The State authorities of
Württemberg had granted him the right to make the experiment over a
period of three years, although all he had submitted to them was a
memorandum telling them how he proposed to run the school. Thus
Steiner was in the unique position for an educator of having no
immediate financial worries, no inspector breathing down his neck, and
an absolute freedom to select his teachers and his curriculum, with a
student body whose parents were willing absolutely to entrust their
children to him and those whom he had selected.

It was arranged that Rudolf Steiner should meet with all the teachers
in Stuttgart in late August and early September for the purpose of
giving them a special training course which would continue almost
until the opening of the school. This opening was scheduled for
September 7th, 1919, under five months from the day the decision was
made to create a new school in Stuttgart run according to principles
derived from the anthroposophical view of man. But before giving this
course an important task awaited him - to return to Dornach and tell
the members there what was being planned at Stuttgart, while at the
same time giving encouragement and advice to those who were working on
the Goetheanum.

In this series of lectures given to the Dornach members, published
under the title of Education as a Social Problem, Steiner began by
speaking about the necessity for the Threefold Social Order, on which
he had been working in Germany for months, insisting in particular on
the need for the fundamental transformation of cultural life. He spoke
of the great dangers threatening mankind from the one-sided
development of the intellect, a faculty that men had only recently
acquired for themselves, independent of divine inspiration. They are
able now to use this faculty for their own ends, but if it is not to
fall into the hands of Ahriman it must in future be permeated by the
Christ Impulse. If men do not use their thinking capacity to fulfill
the divine purposes it will necessarily he misused, and all kinds of
new evils will be allowed entry into the world.

This introduction, on a theme to which he was to revert often in the
last year of his life, was here given mainly as a background for his
detailed explanation of the supreme importance of the role played by
teachers in the social structure, and the qualities that would be
required of them in the new school - how essential it was that they
should be thoroughly versed in the science of spirit, so that they
could have a true appreciation of the children committed to their
charge, as beings of body, soul, and spirit, whose soul faculties
would be unfolding beneath their gaze year by year; and how essential
it was for these teachers to be able to develop living imaginative
thinking in themselves. "The burning question is therefore," he told
his audience, "how can teacher training be transformed in future? It
can be transformed in only one way, and that is, that the teacher
himself absorbs what can come from spiritual science as knowledge of
man's true nature. The teacher must be permeated by the reality of
man’s connection with the supersensible worlds. He must be in the
position to see in the growing child evidence that he has descended
from the supersensible world through conception and birth, has clothed
himself with a body, and wishes to acquire here in the physical world
what he cannot acquire in the life between death and a new birth, and
in which the teacher has to help, Every child should stand before the
soul of the teacher as a question posed by the supersensible world to
the sense world. This question cannot be asked in a definite and
comprehensive way in regard to every individual child unless one
employs the knowledge that comes from spiritual science concerning the
nature of man." \[Education as a Social Problem, N.Y. 1969, Lecture
4\]

As soon as Steiner had given his last lecture in this cycle, a lecture
in which he especially stressed the dangers of the development of
one-sided intelligence, he betook himself to Stuttgart where his
chosen teachers were awaiting him, and here for fourteen consecutive
days he gave three separate courses, one in the morning, another in
the afternoon, and the third in the evening. The course given in the
morning was called The General Knowledge of Man as a Basis for
Pedagogy, a beauti­fully exact title for the actual content of the
course which has been published in several editions in English under
the title of Study of Man. This course is still regarded as the
essential foundation for all work in teacher training programmes for
Steiner schools; and indeed it is the most comprehensive course in
human psychology as well as in educational theory ever given by Rudolf
Steiner. In particular the nature of man as a threefold being is
strongly stressed and illustrated in numerous ways. The second course
is published under the title Practical Course for Teachers, and it
contains general and specific information on both the subject matter
and methods used for children from different age groups. One of these
lectures was also devoted to the arts as they would be taught in the
Waldorf School. The third course was the so-called Pedagogical Course,
or Course on Educational Practice. These courses were completed in the
evening of September 5th. The next day, on which no lectures were
given, was spent by the teachers in making ready for the next day's
ceremonial opening - and perhaps for the beginning of the digestion of
the concentrated food of the previous fortnight! The absence of an
assembly hall in the remodeled restaurant that was to serve as the
school made it necessary for the opening ceremony, attended by parents
and children as well as teachers and anthroposophists, to be held
elsewhere. The school music teacher opened with a Bach Prelude, which
was followed by a recitation by Marie Steiner and a demonstration of
eurythmy by some children whom she had instructed. Then came an
introductory speech by Emil Molt, followed by Rudolf Steiner's opening
address. This, of course was the highlight of the morning's
proceedings. In the afternoon, in an atmosphere of general festivity,
the teachers and children were introduced to each other, and at night
all the teachers were invited to a performance of The Magic Flute in
the Stuttgart Opera House. There Rudolf Steiner sat by Herr Molt,
pointing out to the industrialist where the teachers were all sitting
in different parts of the theatre. On such occasions the years fell
away from him - he was now 58 - and he was as animated and excited as
any of the children. School began the next day.

Steiner's address at the opening of the school, important though it
was, cannot be considered here in any detail As he always did during
the lifetime of the Threefold social movement, he related the
establishment of the school to the need for a new impulse in the
cultural life of Germany, an impulse which should from the beginning
be drawn from the free cultural realm of the Threefold Social Order.
The school was in truth an utterly free enterprise in an educational
world dominated at the time by the state, and with educational
requirements set by the state. Moreover it was a unitary school, and -
an extraordinary innovation at that time - a co-educational school,
offering only general education, without the specialization that in
Germany of that age was thought to be such a great educational
advance. The first Waldorf School was, indeed, so unusual at the time,
and in many respects Waldorf education is so unusual even in our own
age that we shall devote some space to its general features. It is
worth mentioning here that Steiner, even in his opening address, made
it clear that the school was not and never would become a school for
teaching Anthroposophy. The teachers would work from an
anthroposophical impulse and out of the knowledge of Anthroposophy
that they had acquired, including knowledge of the threefold nature of
the human being. But they would tell the children nothing of what lay
behind their teaching. Even in the religious classes that were given
in all German schools in the 1920s no anthroposophical concepts were
taught. A Catholic priest taught the Catholic children and a
Protestant pastor taught the Protestant children. Those parents who
were neither Catholic nor Protestants could choose for their children
a general nondenominational Christianity course given by one of the
regular school teachers, which might of course be somewhat influenced
by the anthroposophical orientation of the teacher. In the early years
of the school it became, as it turned out, by far the most popular of
the three religious courses!

At the center of all anthroposophical thinking in the realm of
education is the recognition that a child is not simply a small man or
woman, and he should not be treated as such, reasoned with, preached
to, filled with intellectual knowledge by adults, and expected to grow
up in the image of his parents or teachers. A child is a potentially
but not actually mature human being who will develop through the years
of childhood at a pace that is virtually the same for all children,
since the pace is governed not only by biological laws but by laws of
the soul and spirit. At birth a child frees his physical body from his
mother's womb, at the change of teeth he frees his etheric body, and
at puberty his astral body. Thus for the first seven years of his
life, all education should be directed toward enabling him to make
proper use of his physical body. With the change of teeth and the
freeing of the etheric body, his education is directed primarily to
this body for the next seven years until puberty. At the age of
fourteen the astral body is usually entirely freed - indeed puberty
actually consists of this freeing - and after the young person is able
to work with forces not available to him before. With such insights as
these provided by anthroposophy, education ceases to be all arbitrary
process of more or less hit-or-miss methods and curricula of study,
and becomes a conscious effort to bring out the full potentialities of
each individual child as they are inherent at each particular age, by
teaching always subjects that belong to that age and in a manner
suitable for it, and not for the age he will have reached two or three
years later. Not until about the age of 21 does a young person receive
his own I which is then freed for his use, as the other bodies were
freed at birth, 7 and 14. It is, of course, possible to teach most
children to read and write before the change of teeth, but it is not
desirable because forces have to be used for reading and writing that
have not yet become fully available for their use. It is possible for
children of eleven to acquire various mathematical aptitudes before
puberty which, according to Waldorf pedagogy, should not be acquired
until later. In the long run nothing whatever is gained by trying to
make use prematurely of these forces. It is not in the least important
at the age of 21 whether one learned to read and write at the age of 5
or at the age of 7. What is important then is one's ability to read
and write well and to possess a lively intelligence unmarred by
premature senes­cence. Children in Steiner schools are always kept in
the same class as others of their age group, and are never allowed to
skip a class because of their precocious intellectual capacities. Many
subjects, especially as taught in the Steiner schools, possess
relatively little intellectual content in the sense that the children
are not expected to understand them in the way adults understand them.
So it is possible to retain precociously intellectual children in the
same class as all others of the same age without boring them; indeed,
it is not at all unusual for such children to be relatively backward
in artistic work, and to experience difficulties when they do
eurythmy. If they are really good in all these subjects and activities
they will certainly be encouraged to help other children who are less
gifted than they, thus learning at an early age that it is a privilege
to possess such gifts, carrying with it the responsibility to place
them at the disposition of others.

In all respects Waldorf education is a general education, and at no
time during the twelve years or so spent at school do the children
specialize in any particular subject. Nor is there any competition
within the classes. Marks are not given; the teacher makes his own
evaluation of the children which is sent to their parents, who usually
discuss the report cards of their children with the teachers and with
the children themselves. The evaluation considers them in relation to
their own past performances and capacities, as the teacher sees them -
never in relation to other children. Parents who wish their children
to shine and outshine others so that they may bask in the glory
reflected on them by their children, receive no encouragement at
Steiner schools; nor are any prizes given. A teacher feels himself
most successful if there is a real solidarity among the members of his
class and a true social feeling, so that no trace of rivalry or
competition shows itself.

Even today all this is very different from what happens in most state
schools. In 1919 in Germany it was truly revolutionary, as was also
the mingling of children from different class backgrounds. In the
first year of the school about 150 children came from the working
class, as we have seen, their parents being employees of the tobacco
factory, whose fees were paid from the "gift-money" made available by
Emil Molt from the factory's profits. The other fifty or sixty
children came from the middle or upper class, their parents being
anthroposophists, very few of whom at this time were from the working
class. As time went on, and the school won a very high reputation in
Stuttgart, and even in Germany as a whole, the student body began to
increase rapidly. By 1928 there were already more than a thousand
children enrolled in the school, and more than fifty teachers. The
proportion of children from the working class necessarily dropped with
this increased enrollment since fees now had to be charged, and except
for the children of the Waldorf Astoria factory workers, it was the
parents who paid them. Indeed, little though this was originally
intended, wherever Steiner schools have come into being, the student
body has never been a true cross-section of society as Steiner would
have wished. Scholarships, full or partial, have ensured that some
children are enrolled whose parents come from the working class. But
they remain a small minority everywhere, and only the original Waldorf
School in Stuttgart has ever had the high proportion of children from
the working class that it had at its beginning in 1919.

Almost all the innovations that distinguish Waldorf from state
schools, and even from so-called "progressive" schools today are based
on Steiner's perception of the child as a developing being with
different needs at different ages. Most modern Waldorf schools, unlike
the first school in Stuttgart at its founding, have kindergartens, and
some even have nursery schools. But no attempt is made in these
schools to teach the children anything with an intellectual content,
as for example reading and writing, because of the perception that the
pre-school child learns almost exclusively through imitation, and
ought to do so. In kindergarten and nursery school, therefore, the
children learn by doing, for example singing, dancing, making things
with their hands, leaving the development of the intellect to the
first year in primary school.

Examples of the adaptation of the school curriculum to the age of the
children could be multiplied indefinitely, and the interested reader
is referred to the many books on the Steiner schools and the kind of
education they offer, including a chapter by the present author in his
“Man and World in the Light of Anthroposophy”. Scarcely less
interesting to educators is the way the schools are administered in
accordance with Steiner's belief that only those who take an active
part in teaching should be responsible for the school management.
Almost all Steiner schools have therefore established a College of
Teachers, which is the decision-making body and includes all fulltime
teachers who are employed on a regular basis. The College, at a
minimum, will choose all new faculty members, and usually makes itself
responsible for all business decisions, including the teachers'
salaries, the decision often being made on the basis of the teacher's
need and responsibilities. The effort is always made to make it clear
to everyone that the salary paid is not regarded as a compensation for
work done, thus obeying the fundamental rule enunciated by Rudolf
Steiner that labor must never be regarded as a commodity - one of the
pillars of the Threefold Order as he explained it. Very few indeed of
the schools making use of Steiner's educational principles have ever
had to be closed because of bad management or lack of parental
support. So perhaps it may be reasonably assumed that the system of
faculty management works, and that professional administrators such as
are to be found in all state school systems are not an absolute
necessity.

Interestingly enough, a report exists in which a state school
inspector expressed his impressions of the original Waldorf School in
Stuttgart after it had been in operation for seven years, by which
time the student body had arisen to over a thousand, and was no longer
dependent on the largesse of Emil Molt, who paid only the fees of
children of the workers in his factory. This report was not made
public, but the inspector, F. Hartlieb, wrote an article based on his
report, and had it published in a Württemberg educational journal. It
was later translated into English and published. Throughout the
article the author, who was not an anthroposophist and had had no
knowledge of Anthroposophy before it became part of his official
duties to report on the Waldorf School, emphasizes how much the state
system could learn from it. Recognizing, as he said, that it was
impossible to appreciate the Waldorf School at its true value without
some knowledge of Steiner's educational principles, he devoted much
space in his report to a (very accurate) explanation of some basic
anthroposophical concepts; and how they are reflected in the
educational practice and in the curriculum of the school. Most
surprisingly for a professional educator, Hartlieb lavished his
praises on the Waldorf School teachers who came to the school from
many different walks of life, each contributing his special talents to
the whole.

"Without prejudice of any sort," he wrote, "I must put on record the
fact that the College of Teachers with its high moral standard and
intellectual attainments gives the Waldorf School its peculiar stamp
and quality. A staff of teachers in such a close bond of union,
working in the same spirit and filled with the same warmth of
enthusiasm, cannot but bring their feeling of unity to daily
expression. Each one serves the other in love; each one radiates
forces, to receive forces into himself in return. . . Thus they grow
together into an exemplary community of life and work, such as
deserves the highest recognition . . . The Waldorf School has no Board
of Governors empowered to inspect its work. Nor does the time-table
subject the individual to any kind of narrowing restrictions. Unity
among the teachers is ensured by the teachers' conferences, at which
all-important questions are discussed in detail, and which the
teachers attend at the School - sometimes several times a week and
until late at night. . . . The children are warmly attached to their
teachers, both men and women, who, without recourse to corporal
punishment, train the soul and spirit of the boys and girls entrusted
to them by love, goodness, wisdom and example, more even than by their
enlightened methods of instruction. The teacher coming from a State
school is struck by the fact that greater freedom of movement is
allowed among the children of the Waldorf School than is generally the
case. . . . The right behavior of the children in the Waldorf School
is not regulated and one-sidedly enforced by an external discipline,
but is founded in the inner life, so as to grow spontaneously from
within. . . . The friendly spirit in the Waldorf School is beautifully
revealed in the monthly festival when all the pupils up to the twelfth
form gather with their teachers in the gymnasium, and follow with
great interest the musical and eurythmy performances. The presence of
the parents, who come in large numbers to all School gatherings, such
as concerts, plays and so on, outside the usual school-work, gives the
festival a homelike character. It also points clearly to the fact that
parents, pupils and teachers are closely associated with one another.
Finally, it should be pointed out that, in conformity with the natural
family life, boys and girls are taught together. The Waldorf School
has established co-education from the first form up to the twelfth and
last class, and has contrived to make the differentiation of the sexes
in soul and spirit serve the cause of education.48 \[F. Hartlieb, The
Free Waldorf School at Stuttgart, London, 1928\]

Almost everything that is done in present-day Steiner schools that
makes them distinctive originates from Rudolf Steiner himself. During
the few years that he was able to supervise the education personally
he proved to be a cornucopia of new ideas and suggestions. The school
festivals referred to by Herr Hartlieb remain today one of the
distinctive features of Steiner schools, as do the concerts, plays and
other performances by the students to which parents are invited. The
festivals, as may be supposed, stemmed from Steiner's numerous
lectures on their significance, of which something will be said in
Chapter 12. For a long time after the founding of the first Waldorf
School in Stuttgart he attended in person as many of the faculty
meetings as he was able, and though they were held regularly every
week he used to make the journey from Dornach to Stuttgart for most of
them. The teachers used to call him "the teacher of the teachers," and
it was at these meetings that he gave them some of his most fruitful
suggestions. To every question he was asked he gave an answer, and he
played an active part in all discussions.

Steiner, it appears, was also greatly loved by the children, and
during his sojourns in Stuttgart he visited as many classes as he
could, always with the consent of their teachers. Such visits were
never looked upon as inspections, and he never at any time permitted
himself a word of criticism of the teacher in the presence of the
class. Sometimes, at the teacher's sugges­tion he would take over the
class for the rest of the period, giving an impromptu presentation
which often proved of immense benefit to the still not very
experienced teacher. When he left the classroom he liked to ask the
children if they loved their teachers, always to be met with the
enthusiastic "yes" that he quite certainly expected.

Many of the teachers used to make the not very long journey from
Stuttgart to Dornach at the weekends for the express purpose of asking
Rudolf Steiner yet another set of questions. In Dornach these men and
women brought a breath of fresh air to the somewhat hothouse
atmosphere. The first group of teachers, being drawn from many
professions and coming from all parts of the German-speaking world,
included people who had already won distinction elsewhere, though they
were new to teaching. They made a considerable impression in Dornach
not only with their questions but with their often brilliant talk. The
members in Dornach, many of whom had lived there since before the war,
were devoted and knowledgeable anthroposophists, but few of them could
be considered men and women of the world. Some of them resented the
invasion by the Stuttgart teachers and also the enthusiastic bands of
young people who were working in one capacity or another for the
Threefold Social Order. Some of the teachers and perhaps a majority of
the young workers had a relatively slight knowledge of Anthroposophy,
which was found somewhat shocking by many older members. Dornach had
by this time become the real center of Anthroposophy, but important
work continued to be done in other centers such as Stuttgart, Munich
and Berlin, whose members were loath to admit the new supremacy of
Dornach resulting from the building of the Goetheanum, and the work
connected with it.

In addition to his numerous formal and informal talks to the Stuttgart
teachers, Rudolf Steiner soon began to give courses in pedagogy
elsewhere than in Stuttgart and Dornach. A Christmas educational
conference held in the Goetheanum in 1921 was the occasion for visits
of many foreign educators to Dornach, leading to further invitations
to lecture abroad, in the hope that similar Waldorf Schools could be
inaugurated outside Switzerland and Germany, The impulse towards this
education proved especially strong in England. Rudolf Steiner was
first invited to speak at an educational festival held in April 1922
at Shakespeare's birthplace, Stratford-on-Avon. He took the
opportunity not only to see about a dozen plays - he approved of the
way the comedies were presented, but had other ideas on the staging of
the tragedies - but also to give a lecture on Shakespeare himself and
his inspiration, as well as on education. His lectures were well
reported in the English press, and he was asked to deliver a whole
course of lectures later in the year at Manchester College, Oxford
University. These lectures were later published under the title The
Spiritual Ground of Education. Thus, as early as 1922, Steiner became
well known in English educational circles, and the movement to start
another school on the lines of the Waldorf School in Stuttgart made
some headway.

Two further series of lectures on education were given in 1923
(Ilkley) and in 1924 (Torquay). By the time the second cycle was given
under the title of The Kingdom of Childhood it had been determined
that an English school would be founded. This was accomplished the
following year when the so-called New School in Streatham, a London
suburb, came into being. Later its name was changed to Michael Hall
School; it still exists, being located now at Forest Row in Sussex.

In 1923 a young married couple opened a Waldorf School in a private
house in The Hague in Holland, with ten pupils. Rudolf Steiner,
encouraged by the initiative, paid it a visit later in the year, and
the following year, when he visited Arnhem, Holland, for the last
series of lectures he was to give in that country, he found time in a
very crowded programme to give there a remarkable cycle of ten
lectures, published under the English title of "Human Values in
Education", in which he spoke fervently about the future of all
anthroposophical work in the world, including education. So many new
possibilities existed now, he told his audience, that were not present
before, and the spiritual world was waiting to give new inspirations
to mankind. The school in the Hague survived and expanded, under a
small group of very gifted teachers who remained with it for decades;
and though it was closed down by the Nazis during the war, it was
reopened immediately after their departure. Several schools in other
countries were opened during the next decade, including the first
school in the United States, the Rudolf Steiner School in New York,
opened in 1929.

Until World War II the Steiner school movement grew rather slowly, in
part because of financial stringencies, including the uncontrolled
inflation in Germany and Austria in the early 1920s, and the worldwide
depression of the l930s. The National Socialist regime in Germany
closed down all the Waldorf schools, including the parent school in
Stuttgart, for reasons that do credit to the schools rather than to
the Nazis! They claimed that the Waldorf schools were insufficiently
nationalistic (as they said also unceasingly about Rudolf Steiner
himself whom they regarded as an implacable enemy of their party),
and, worse still, the schools had as their aim the development of free
individualities. Naturally they could scarcely defend themselves
against such charges, of which they were obviously guilty, and proud
of the fact. But they had their reward after the Nazi regime was
overthrown when the British and United States' military governments
did all they could to help them back into operation, for precisely the
same reason that they had been suppressed by the Third Reich.

In spite of the shortage of materials and bombed out buildings, the
schools soon recovered their position as by far the largest private
educational system in Germany. The Nazi authorities allowed two of the
three Dutch schools to remain open, and of course Switzerland and
Sweden as neutrals were unaffected by the Nazi tyranny, except for the
financial stringencies engendered by the war itself and the shortages
from which they suffered. In Great Britain, curiously enough, all the
major schools were founded already before the war and continued to
operate during it; and it was not until very recent times that the
movement in Britain began to add more schools. The leading school had
to be evacuated far from London during the war.

By 1952 there were 65 schools operating throughout the world, though
several of these were small and struggling, and not all did in fact
survive into the next decade. But with the 1960s the movement began a
considerable expansion, the end of which is by no means in sight. It
is difficult to state with any accuracy just how many Waldorf and
Steiner schools are now in 1980 in operation, in part because some of
the more recent schools may not be using all the elements of Steiner
education used by the older and better established schools. There is
no system of accreditation, and a school that likes to call itself a
Steiner school will always be given the benefit of the doubt by its
elders. Certainly there are more than 150 Steiner schools now in
operation \[there are now (2005) around 800 – Ed.\], making it the
largest group of private schools in the world following the same
educational principles. Indeed, there is no educational movement with
a foothold in all five (or six) continents that can be compared with
it.

As a consequence, it is mainly because of Rudolf Steiner's
contributions to education that he is known to the world today. But
probably very few people indeed are aware that the first school in
Stuttgart on which all others have been modelled, arose from the
positive wish of its founder Emil Molt to make a first step forward
toward the “Threefold Society”, by establishing a new kind of school
in the spiritual/cultural domain, which would be a free and unitary
co-educational school of a kind that was entirely unique in its time.
Even today, sixty years later, the same may be said of the network of
Steiner schools throughout the world, even though some elements or
Steiner education have indeed been taken over by others, usually
without acknowledgement. Few, if any, of these schools would deny
today that they owe almost everything to the educational impulse given
by their original founder, Rudolf Steiner, whose lectures on education
remain the basis for every Waldorf teacher training course given
anywhere through­out the world.
