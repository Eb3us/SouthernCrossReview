<h3>Chapter 14</h3>

</header>

<main>
<p>ORIGINS</p>
<p>Most favela dwellers come from the north, from Bahia, Pernambuco,
Ceará, Minas Gerais. Many from still farther away. Most find it a
thousand times better here then there, even if they must live in a
favela. "Here at least we eat. There you plant in the scorching heat and
then comes the harvest. You harvest, but the buyer pays a miserable
sum." Or: "You plant, it doesn't rain, the crop is ruined." "We suffered
there, and when the harvest brought nothing in I swore never to plant
again; two days later we left with our belongings and children, a
two-day bus trip." That's not so much though; most leave by train, which
takes up to ten days, depending on the distance.</p>
<p>They usually leave their traditions and customs behind. Once in Sao
Paulo they seldom dance the quadrilla, hardly any folk-songs are sung;
bumba meu moi (meu boi: "my ox", a kind of religious theatre and
procession) or Folia dos Reis (a musical play about the Three Wise Men),
are hardly ever performed. Many are ashamed of these things and think
that in the city they must be "modern" and sing, dance and celebrate
differently. That's why life in the favela, almost everywhere in the
city in fact, is so barren and monotonously gray. But that's also why
most of them still harbor a silent nostalgia for their "terra", and many
want to go back when they're old to live in peace on their savings.</p>
<p>In the city they no longer orient themselves according to the
goodness which emanates from the people, but according to the
civilization of the wealthy as they see proclaimed on television, etc. -
with disastrous results.</p>
<p>EDUCATION</p>
<p>Officially, there are eight years of compulsory education. But many
children, especially girls, don't go to school at all because their
parents don't consider it necessary, and they do more work in the home
than the boys, who grow up much freer and hardly help at all. When they
do go to school they are often absent and are handicapped by the fact
that their parents can't help them with their homework. Furthermore,
they have not had adequate nutrition or stimulation since the time of
birth. They are usually left back in the first year, drag themselves
through school life, and give up at the third or fourth grade.
Completing four years of school is already something special and makes
life easier, because then there are various trade courses which they can
take: for girls hair-dresser, manicurist, seamstress, nurse's assistant;
for boys: mechanic, waiter, cook, etc.</p>
<p>EARNINGS</p>
<p>Most favela people earn the salário mínimo (the legal minimum wage) -
about $100 per month. The family income is increased by what some
children earn by shining shoes, washing cars or delivering women's
shopping home in carts from the markets. This isn't much, but sometimes
they earn in a day more than the father's daily wage. This is of course
very tempting for them. They earn some money from which, according to
character and inclination, they pass a larger or smaller amount to their
homes and the rest they spend on chewing gum, sweets and similar stuff
which they never got as small children. But the future is lost because
they then either don't go to school anymore at all or only sporadically,
reach only the second grade and never have a chance to learn a trade.
This means that they, like their fathers, must do the heaviest and
dirtiest work.</p>
<p>FOOD</p>
<p>Rice and beans, rice and beans, rice and beans, for lunch and supper.
The beans are usually cooked in a pot, spiced with some garlic, and rice
is added. Also mistura (mixture). This means everything else, for
example meat and vegetables. The poorer ones divide a small piece of
meat among the members of the family. Vegetables are hardly ever eaten
and when they are it's mostly tomatoes and "leaves" (any kind of
lettuce). But in general green is written in small letters. For example,
if something better is cooked for Christmas, it consists of rice and
beans, somewhat more meat (usually chicken), noodles with tomato sauce,
"maionese", that is, potato salad with mayonnaise. Meals are monotonous
and stereotyped. On the one hand it's practical, for the housewife's
dilemma "What will I cook?" is absent. On the other hand this monotony
has negative effects which go beyond the physical. At home I hardly ever
cook beans and rice and "invent" new meals from leftovers. That's what I
always tell the children, that cooking is an art and that they should
invent something, even if it's not always successful.</p>
<p>In the north rice (which isn't native to Brazil, having established
itself around 1810 with the opening of the harbors) is hardly eaten.
Sweet potatoes, manioca, cará and other roots are preferred. A lot of
manioca-meal is eaten with beans. (We call it sawdust because it's so
dry and you have difficulty swallowing it at first.)</p>
<p>DIARY 1976-1980</p>
<p>7 September 1976. Brazil's Independence Day</p>
<p>I first stepped on Brazilian soil eleven years ago. Surely I was more
rested then after a 24 day ocean voyage than I am now. In any case, I am
exhausted today and really feel the need for a rest. I must take a
breath and objectively think about what I am to do during the next years
of my life, whether I'll stay in the Waldorf School or not, what I can
accomplish here, etc. Many who think altruistically say I should
dedicate myself completely to the "poor". But how? I must earn money.
Furthermore, I find that the wealthy children are often just as poor,
when I consider the more difficult cases in my class.</p>
<p>NOVEMBER 1976</p>
<p>The school play is approaching with enormous strides. The performance
of "Widukind" with my eighth grade is almost upon us. I am torn asunder
between rehearsals, painting scenery, costume fittings and my
housewifely duties. The children at home bear it calmly and often
receive me with nice surprises. Besides all this are the normal classes,
preparation for Christmas, etc.</p>
<p>CHRISTMAAS 1976</p>
<p>Every year Waldorf schools perform the "Oberurfer Christmas play".
For the past three years I have been taking increasing numbers of favela
children to see it. This time there were about forty. And how do you
organize this bunch to get them all into the city buses? Well, it's not
easy, but the mass isn't so amorphous either, for smaller groups develop
naturally within the larger one, which is difficult to oversee as a
whole. Older children care for younger ones, brothers and sisters watch
out that they are all still there.</p>
<p>Before we depart I look to see if we are more or less presentable.
They all gather in front of my gate. " Blow your nose." - "Go and wash
your hands." - "Get the comb in the children's room and comb your hair
and if it's still too stringy, put a kerchief over it."</p>
<p>A boy with whom I had only a nodding acquaintance came without shoes.
I loaned him a pair of Ruben's. But they didn't fit, so he carried them
in his hands and when we arrived at the school he placed them neatly at
the entrance of the auditorium. Being so squeezed in was just too
unusual for him. After all, the shepherds go barefoot in the Christmas
play.</p>
<p>Finally we are ready to march. Divided into two groups, I push them
into the first bus, then the second. "We'll meet at the Borba Gato
bus-stop." Except for the bigger ones, the children all pass through the
turnstile without having to pay.</p>
<p>I march up the hill to the Waldorf School with this endless tail of
children. In an orderly column we enter the auditorium. Many parents
smile, touched; others look on somewhat shocked at this unexpected,
unusual sight of poor, brown, black (but also white) children in this
"white" setting. We sit in the first rows and they all beam at me. The
play begins, the angel floats in.</p>
<p>"An angel!" Vitoria cries from the heart. She, who is so pitch-black
and always pushed aside by the others, could hardly grasp the angel's
brilliant white light. For most of them theater is reality.</p>
<p>We met Peter Schmidt of the Giroflex factory on the way back. "What
is this mob of children?" I briefly described our work in the favela.
"We'll come back to that again," he said. A historic phrase! For he
really did come back to it, for which I am eternally grateful. He was
the first to take our work seriously and promised to help. And not only
promised. In 1977 we had a teacher paid by Giroflex. We were thus able
to expand the favela work and the children could come every day. After a
bad experience with a trained teacher, I employed Cido as youth
supervisor, cooking teacher, etc. The children were thrilled. Cido is
simply ideal in that he has imagination, ideas, likes to work, feels
good with the children, is able to handle the large groups that stream
to us during festivals. Furthermore, he was poor himself as a child and
knows how it feels.</p>
<p>The number of children has grown enormously. Thank God Dona Regina
and Dona Helena had pity on us. Dona Regina sews purses, pillowcases,
blankets with the children from leftovers and tells them stories while
doing so. Dona Helena knits with them – wallets, dwarf-dolls, sweaters.
Both are desperate for more room. We are so cramped. Everything is done
in the tiny children’s room, which contains a three-tier bed, a closet
and desk. Children swarm everywhere – on the bed, the floor, the desk.
And the smell and the heat that develop after two hours of work! The
smell improves somewhat when Cido is giving his cooking lessons at the
same time. Meanwhile I help the children with their homework, clear a
niche in the kitchen to prepare supper, listen to Ruben’s multiplication
tables practice, do rhythmic clapping with Marcia, etc.</p>
<p>Space! Space! Space is what we need!</p>
<p>JULY 1977</p>
<p>I've just returned from Guarajú, the beach serving the Sao Paulo
upper crust. Dr. Gudrun of the anthroposophical clinic lent us her
holiday house for a week. Us, that is, me and fourteen children from the
favela as well as Maristela, Marcia and Rubens. As the children entered
the house they were stunned for a moment, then broke out in cries of
joy, ran through all the rooms and just couldn't believe that it would
belong to them for a week. The same thing happened when we went to the
sea: first apprehension looking at the infinite expanse of water, then
they skipped in screaming for happiness. So much water all at once. Most
of them knew only the miserable favela stream</p>
<p>where they get their water. The week was a complete success: water,
sun, an excess of room to play, rocks to climb, sand and castles and
waterfalls to build. For once they were always clean, with full stomachs
and occupied as children should be. I could teach them all the games I
knew (ball-games, halma, memory, mikado, jumping, racing) During the
mid-day break they read, drew or knitted. Most impressive was that
everything was fun, even the things which don't usually inspire much
enthusiasm like cooking and washing dishes. My main occupation at the
sea was counting heads in the waves. What a fright when one wasn't
visible behind the waves!</p>
