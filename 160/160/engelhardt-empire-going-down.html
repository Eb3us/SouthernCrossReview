<h3>But What Isn't?</h3>

</header>

<main>
<p class="intro">He’s the man of the hour (and you can choose your hour), win, lose,
or draw. I mean, who can deny it? Certainly not the crowd at his debate
with Kamala Harris that, as he <a
href="https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-audience-harris-debate-gutfeld-b2615455.html">reminded
us</a> recently, absolutely “went crazy” over what he had to say. (And
it couldn’t matter less that the event had no live audience whatsoever.)
In a sense, he isn’t wrong. After all, it’s still all too possible that,
in a couple of weeks, he could once again be elected — yes! — president
of the United States.</p>
<p>Indeed, it’s as yet unclear whether American voters will decline The
Donald, but what is increasingly clear — there can’t be a doubt on the
subject — is that he himself is <a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/06/trump-behavior-final-meltdown">on
the decline</a> in a typically wild and mad sort of way. And yet he
might indeed still be elected to lead (even if that hardly seems the
right word anymore) this country. And what exactly does that tell us
about this all-American world of ours?</p>
<p>All too much, I fear. Above all, that it’s increasingly anything but
all-American.</p>
<p>Can you believe that only 30-plus years ago, after the Soviet Union
collapsed, this country, the very one Donald Trump might once again
preside over, was considered (at least in Washington) the “<a
href="https://www.airandspaceforces.com/article/0792edit/">lone
superpower</a>” on planet Earth? And in some sense, it actually was.
After all, the great European imperial powers were ancient history by
then, the Russians in a state of post-Cold War devastation, and
Communist China had yet to truly begin its rise. But like all great
imperial powers, it should now be far clearer that, in the wake of a
seemingly <a
href="https://tomdispatch.com/william-astore-turning-victory-into-defeat/">endless
series of lost wars</a> abroad, its global “moment” has long been
ending. Its ability to command or direct the world now seems largely a
thing of the past. There can be little question any more that the
(increasingly dis-)United States is an imperial power on the
decline.</p>
<p><strong>Make America Grotesque Again?</strong></p>
<p>Don’t misunderstand me. This country remains all too powerful when it
comes to its military and nuclear forces. Just check out the latest <a
href="https://www.defensenews.com/pentagon/2024/03/11/pentagon-unveils-850-billion-budget-request-amid-spending-uncertainty/">Pentagon
budget</a> or the <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/30/us/politics/us-deploys-troops-middle-east.html">more
than 40,000</a> American military personnel, <a
href="https://www.axios.com/2024/08/28/us-warships-middle-east-iran-israel-war">battleships</a>,
<a
href="https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2024/08/26/two-us-aircraft-carriers-to-stay-in-middle-east-after-hezbollah-attack/">aircraft
carriers</a>, <a
href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/pentagon-tells-israel-it-will-adjust-us-troops-middle-east-2024-08-02/">jet
fighter planes</a>, and who knows what else deployed to a Middle East
that Israel is now blowing sky-high. But if you want a measurement of
just how far the Lone Superpower has fallen, keep in mind that, once
upon a time not so terribly long ago, an Israeli leader like Benjamin
Netanyahu would never have dared to pay so little attention to the
desires of Washington when it came to his actions in the Middle East.
Once upon a time, a figure like Netanyahu couldn’t have ignored <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/07/us/politics/biden-israel-oct-7-gaza-hamas.html">the
wishes of the top officials</a> of the very country still arming his own
in a <a
href="https://www.ap.org/news-highlights/spotlights/2024/us-spends-a-record-17-9-billion-on-military-aid-to-israel-since-last-oct-7/">staggering
fashion</a>, while doing whatever he damn well pleased to tear his
region to shreds.</p>
<p>Consider him visible evidence that this country is indeed no longer
the world’s lone superpower (and not just because of the rise of China
either). Yes, the Pentagon budget remains a staggering (and <a
href="https://tomdispatch.com/spending-unlimited-2/">still
increasing</a>) affair, but something has certainly changed. Consider it
anything but symbolic (though it is that, too) that 81-year-old Joe
Biden is by far the oldest president in American history. (Ronald Reagan
left office at age 77.) Worse yet, should Donald Trump win re-election
this November and last until the end of his term, he would set a new
record and <a
href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2024/06/14/donald-trump-age-birthday-president/">leave
Biden</a> in the aging dust of history.</p>

<p>While it no longer even occurs to observers to use a phrase like
“lone superpower” when it comes to the United States, it still seems
that, in a deeper sense, the reality of this country’s imperial decline
has yet to be fully taken in here, even by those who no longer see it as
the operative great power on Planet Earth. In truth, it’s not just that
it has lost much of its grandeur and influence abroad but that, though
this is seldom mentioned in such a context, it’s visibly coming apart at
the seams right here at home and that should, of course, be a
significant part of any definition of imperial decline. As it happens,
such a decline of a major global power will always prove anything but a
distant foreign affair.</p>
<p>Even if it’s not normally thought about or written about that way, it
is, in fact, happening right here, right now, in these increasingly
dis-United States of America in a distinctly up close and personal
fashion. At this point, you can, in fact, see evidence of it almost any
time you turn on the news. In some sense, it couldn’t be more graphic or
literal. After all, former president Donald Trump, once again running
for president, is, symbolically speaking, declining before our very eyes
as he rants and verbally stumbles in a <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/06/us/politics/trump-speeches-age-cognitive-decline.html">distinctly
declinist fashion</a>, even if to the cheers of striking numbers of his
MAGA fans and followers. (By the way, in light of recent history, isn’t
it perhaps time to redefine MAGA as Make America Grotesque Again?)</p>
<p>And yes, in these years of imperial decline, Donald Trump has gotten
(whether positively or negatively) almost unprecedented attention here
at home. Sometimes, in fact, it seems as if he (and he alone)
<em>is</em> the news. But here’s the truly strange thing: he, the MAGA
movement, and Election 2024 are seldom seen for what (at least in part)
they really are. He, that MAGA phenomenon, and the 20 million — yes, 20
million! — military-style AR-15 automatic rifles (the <a
href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/interactive/2023/american-ar-15-gun-owners/">best-selling
rifle in America</a>) now in private hands — mainly the mitts of those
who are White, male, between the ages of 40 and 65, and have accompanied
him into this version of America — actually represent the truest sign of
imperial decline imaginable in the place its leaders still like to think
of as the greatest on Planet Earth.</p>
<p>Yes, Donald Trump is living, breathing evidence that this country is
none too slowly coming apart at the seams. I mean, when in our history
could you count on the fact that, if one candidate for president loses
the upcoming election, he (and yes, it distinctly is a <em>he</em>) will
undoubtedly claim that it’s been stolen from him and that he actually
won? And his followers, significant numbers of them armed to the teeth,
will agree with him and do who knows what (but nothing good). And of
course, were he instead to win, four years later you can count on one
thing: in some sense, this country is likely to be politically
unrecognizable. If you don’t believe me, just check out the Heritage
Foundation’s <a href="https://tomdispatch.com/project-2025/">Project
2025</a> to get a sense of the direction that a whole crew of his former
officials and other Trumpian types think it should head. In other words,
the United States is not just going down as a global power but
potentially, in some fashion, beginning to disintegrate domestically as
well, even possibly as a democracy. And if that isn’t both the
functional and the literal definition of “decline,” what is?</p>
<p>Let me just say that, if I could bring my parents back from the
(long) dead and tell them the fantastic story of Donald Trump and how he
became president or, for that matter, how the Supreme Court, led by six
right-wing (including three Trump-appointed) justices, essentially
immunized a significant range of his illegal acts in office by <a
href="https://www.laprogressive.com/law-and-justice/second-coming-of-dred-scott">granting
him</a> “presumptive immunity” for them, I guarantee you they wouldn’t
have believed such a thing possible. Nor would they have believed that a
“businessman,” without the slightest political background, who survived
multiple (and I do mean <a
href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2016/live-updates/general-election/real-time-fact-checking-and-analysis-of-the-first-presidential-debate/fact-check-has-trump-declared-bankruptcy-four-or-six-times/">multiple</a>)
bankruptcies and was best known for hosting a reality (or perhaps
irreality) TV show, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Apprentice_(American_TV_series)"><em>The
Apprentice</em></a>, for 14 seasons that tested the supposed business
skills of its contestants, could become president of the United
States.</p>
<p>Trump’s very victory in 2016 should, in other words, have instantly
been seen as the functional definition of American imperial decline — a
crucial sign of the weakening and potential collapse of this country’s
position in the world translated into domestic politics. And an election
victory this November could, in the end, mean both the figurative and
literal bankruptcy of the American system, while his defeat, in a nation
now armed to the teeth, could give chaos a new name in the imperial
homeland.</p>
<p>In other words, whether Donald Trump wins or loses Election 2024,
this country is in trouble deep and, four years from now, its situation
could be almost unimaginable. It could be run by a degenerating
82-year-old madman or, even with Kamala Harris in the White House, a
country in an ever more deeply divided and increasingly violent state of
mind. It will not be, as it proudly proclaimed itself once upon a
distant time, “the leader of the free world,” nor is it likely to be a
fully functional global superpower (though what chaos or devastating
violence its “fall” could bring the world, including <a
href="https://tomdispatch.com/powder-keg-in-the-pacific/">future
conflicts</a> with China, remains hard to imagine).</p>
<p><strong>Chill, Baby, Chill?</strong></p>
<p>And let’s not forget that, in some sense, that may be the least of
our problems. After all, as we’ve experienced all too recently with
hurricanes <a
href="https://www.sc.edu/uofsc/posts/2024/10/conversation-hurricane-helene-deadly-disaster-six-states.php">Helene</a>
and <a
href="https://www.npr.org/sections/the-picture-show/2024/10/10/g-s1-27291/photos-hurricane-milton-slams-florida">Milton</a>,
whatever devastation may lie ahead socially and politically for this
country, another kind of devastation is fast becoming a distinct (and
distinctive) part of everyday life, here and in the world at large.
Whether we’re talking about increasingly powerful storms or ever more
devastating <a
href="https://www.nature.org/en-us/what-we-do/our-priorities/tackle-climate-change/climate-change-stories/extreme-wildfires-are-getting-worse-with-climate-change/">fires</a>
and <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/climate/global-flooding-climate-change.html">floods</a>,
we’re on a planet that’s heading for trouble in a big-time fashion.</p>
<p>The fact is that we all now live on a different Earth, one that’s
clearly going to experience devastating weather of every imaginable
sort. Climate change, in other words, is truly our new reality and it’s
clear that the devastation has only begun.</p>
<p>As ever more homelands on this planet become ever less livable and
ever greater numbers of us <a
href="https://www.zurich.com/media/magazine/2022/there-could-be-1-2-billion-climate-refugees-by-2050-here-s-what-you-need-to-know">begin
wandering</a> in search of places to inhabit — yes, Donald, climate
change is indeed creating a previously inconceivable world of “illegal
immigrants”! — imagine the once greatest power on planet Earth with a
president who <a
href="https://democrats.org/news/donald-the-denier-donald-trump-has-repeatedly-called-climate-change-a-hoax/">still
insists</a> that global warming is a “hoax.” Imagine a president on this
very planet right now who plans, above all else, to “<a
href="https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-drill-baby-drill-plan-wrong-answer-right-questions-rcna165805">drill,
baby, drill</a>” from his first day back in the White House — and that’s
in the nation that’s already the world’s record producer of <a
href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61545">oil</a> and
<a
href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rrapier/2024/07/24/us-grows-its-leads-in-natural-gas-production-and-lng-exports/">natural
gas</a>.</p>
<p>That should, of course, be the definition of creating a dysfunctional
country on an increasingly dysfunctional planet, one where the old
imperial dreams of so many “great powers” will have ever less
meaning.</p>
<p>Yes, the Middle East is now in ever greater chaos as the Biden
administration’s support for Netanyahu only continues, even as he draws
even more of the region into disastrous conflict, while <a
href="https://www.nbcnews.com/investigations/israel-not-briefed-us-military-officials-plans-retaliation-iran-rcna174443">hardly
bothering</a> to consult with Washington’s top officials. Still, count
on one thing: the chaos you see out there now is, in its own eerie
fashion, already coming home to roost and if Donald Trump ends up back
in the White House, believe me, we’ll need another term entirely than
“lone superpower” to describe this country.</p>
<p>Might the planet’s “great stupid power” work?</p>
<p>And mind you, despite the rise of China, it still remains an open
question, whether there can be another lone superpower of any sort or
even a truly great power on a planet all too literally going to hell in
a (flaming) handbasket, one whose land surface and ocean temperatures
have already hit <a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/oct/08/earths-vital-signs-show-humanitys-future-in-balance-say-climate-experts">record
levels</a> with far worse to come.</p>
<p>You might almost imagine that climate change had grasped the
withering global power of the United States and decided to act
accordingly. In some fashion, we now seem to be on a post-imperial
planet in which — if only — the best approach would be: chill, baby,
chill.</p>
