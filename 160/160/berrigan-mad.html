<h1>Militarism Abuse Disorder</h1>
<p><img src="berrigan-mad-1.png" class="a" /></p>
<h3>A Very American Malaise</h3>
<h2>By <a href="https://tomdispatch.com/authors/fridaberrigan/">Frida Berrigan</a></h2>


</header>

<main>
<p class="intro">My name is Frida and my community is military dependent. (I feel, by
the way, like I’m introducing myself at a very strange AA-like meeting
with lousy coffee.) As with people who have substance abuse disorders,
I’m part of a very large club. After all, there are weapons
manufacturers and subcontractors <a
href="https://tomdispatch.com/congress-has-been-captured-by-the-arms-industry/">in
just about</a> every congressional district in the <a
href="https://oldcc.gov/sites/default/files/OLDCC_DSBS_FY2021_FINAL_WEB.pdf">country</a>,
so that members of Congress will never forget whom they are really
working for: the military-industrial complex.</p>
<p>Using the vernacular of the day, perhaps it’s particularly on target
to say that our whole country suffers from Militarism Abuse Disorder or
(all too appropriately) MAD.</p>
<p>I must confess that I don’t like to admit to my military dependency.
Who does? In my case, it’s a tough one for a few reasons, the biggest
being that I’m an avowed pacifist who believes that war is a crime
against humanity, a failure of the imagination, and never (no, <em>not
ever</em>) necessary. Along with the rest of my family of five, I live
<a
href="https://nwtrcc.org/war-tax-resistance-resources/pamphlets/practical-war-tax-resistance-5/">below
the taxable income</a> level. That way, we don’t pay <a
href="https://www.nationalpriorities.org/analysis/2024/tax-day-2024/">into
a system</a> that funds war preparations and war-making. We have to be a
little creative to make our money stretch further and we don’t eat out
or go to the movies every week. But we don’t ever feel deprived as a
result. In essence, I’ve traded career success and workplace achievement
for a <a
href="https://www.warresisters.org/store/where-your-income-tax-money-really-goes-fy2025">slightly
clearer conscience</a> and time — time to work to end militarism and
break our collective addiction!</p>
<p>The Peter G. Peterson Foundation <a
href="https://www.pgpf.org/budget-basics/budget-explainer-national-defense">estimates</a>
that, in 2023, the United States of America spent $142 billion buying
weapons systems and another $122 billion on the research and development
of future weaponry and other militarized equipment. And keep in mind
that those big numbers represent only a small fraction of any Pentagon
budget, the latest of which the Pentagon’s proposing to be <a
href="https://breakingdefense.com/2024/03/defense-budget-2025-defense-spending-biden-how-much-money-does-the-pentagon-get/">$849.8
billion</a> for 2025 — and that’s just one year (and <a
href="https://tomdispatch.com/fueling-the-warfare-state/">not all of
what passes</a> for “national defense” spending either). A recent
analysis by the Costs of War Project at Brown University <a
href="https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/costs/economic/budget">calculated</a>
that, since September 11, 2001, the United States has used an estimated
$8 trillion-plus just for its post-9/11 wars. Talk about addiction! It
makes me pretty MAD, if I’m being honest with you!</p>
<p>It would be nice to ignore such monstrous numbers and the even bigger
implications they suggest, to unfocus my eyes slightly as I regularly
drive by the fenced facilities, manicured office parks, and noisy,
bustling shipyards that make up the mega-billion-dollar-a-year industry
right in my own neighborhood that’s preparing for… well, yes… the end of
the world. Instead, I’m trying to be clear-eyed and aware. I’m checking
my personal life all the time for compromise or conciliation with
militarism: Am I being brainwashed when I find myself cheering for the
fighters in that blockbuster movie we splurged on? Am I doing enough to
push for a ceasefire in Gaza? Am I showing up with young people in my
community who are backing higher salaries for teachers and no more
police in schools? And of course, I keep asking myself: How are my daily
consumer decisions lining up with my lofty politics?</p>
<p>I don’t always like the answers that come up in response to such
questions, but I keep asking them, keep trying, keep pushing. Those who
suffer from Militarism Abuse Disorder can’t even ask the questions,
because they’re distracted by the promises of good jobs, nice
apartments, and cheap consumer goods that the military-industrial
complex is always claiming are right around the corner.</p>
<p>But here in my community, they never deliver!</p>
<p><strong>New London: A Profile of Militarism Abuse
Disorder</strong></p>
<p><a
href="https://www.ctdatahaven.org/sites/ctdatahaven/files/new_london_profile_v1.pdf">New
London</a>is a town of fewer than 28,000 people. The median income here
is a little over $46,000 — $32,000 less than the state average. We are a
very <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/new-london/">old
community</a>. Long part of the fishing and hunting grounds of the <a
href="https://www.easternpequottribalnation.org/">Eastern Pequots,</a>
<a href="https://nehanticnation.com/">Nehantics</a>, <a
href="https://www.mptn-nsn.gov/">Mashantucket Pequot</a>, and <a
href="https://www.mohegan.nsn.us/">Mohegan</a>, the city was founded in
the 1600s and incorporated in the late 1700s. You see evidence of our
age in the shape of our streets, curbed and meandering, long ago carved
out of fields by cows and wagons, and in our architecture — aging
industrial buildings, warehouses, and ice houses in the neighborhoods
where their workers once lived — now derelict and empty or repurposed as
auto repair stores or barber shops.</p>
<p>Sometimes I watch, almost mesmerized by the ferocious energy of all
those cars careening up Howard Street on their way to work at <a
href="https://www.gdeb.com/">General Dynamics</a>. Car after car headed
for work at the very break of day. Every workday at about 3 p.m., they
reverse course, a river of steel and plastic rushing and then idling in
traffic, trying to get out of town as fast as possible.</p>

<p>General Dynamics Electric Boat repairs, services, and manufactures
submarines armed with both conventional and nuclear weapons. And it
certainly tells you something about our world that the company is in the
midst of a <a
href="https://www.cbia.com/news/featured/electric-boat-workforce/">major
hiring jag,</a> looking to fill thousands of positions in New London,
Groton, and coastal Rhode Island to build the <a
href="http://columbia-class.com/">Columbia-class</a> submarine, the next
generation of nuclear-powered, nuclear-armed subs. Those behemoths of
human ingenuity and engineering will <a
href="https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/navys-132000000000-columbia-class-submarine-has-problem-211960">cost
taxpayers</a> a whopping $132 billion, with each of the 12 new boats
clocking in at about $15 billion — and mind you, that’s before anything
even goes wrong or the schedule to produce them predictably stretches
out and out. The company has already solved one big problem: how to <a
href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pentagon-budget-price-gouging-military-contractors-60-minutes-2023-05-21/">wring
maximum profits</a> out of this next generation of
planet-obliteration-capable subs. And that’s a problem that isn’t even
particularly hard to sort out, because some of those <a
href="https://investorrelations.gd.com/news/press-release-details/2023/General-Dynamics-Electric-Boat-Awarded-967-Million-Contract-Modification-for-Virginia-Class-Submarines/default.aspx">contracts</a>
are “cost plus,” meaning <a
href="https://news.usni.org/2019/11/13/first-2-columbia-ssbns-will-have-cost-plus-contract-remaining-subs-will-be-fixed-price">the
company</a> says what the project costs and then adds a percentage on
top of that as profit.</p>
<p>Such a cost-plus business bothers me a lot. I could <em>almost</em>
be converted into a hard-nosed militarist if our weapons production
industry was a nonprofit set of organizations, run with the kind of
shoestring ingenuity that dozens of outfits in New London employ to feed
the hungry, house the homeless, and care for the victims of domestic
violence.</p>
<p>I break from my traffic-watching fugue on Howard Street to reflect on
all that furious effort, all those advanced degrees, all that almost
impossible intelligence being poured into making an even better, bigger,
faster, sleeker, stealthier weapons-delivery system, capable of carrying
and firing conventional and nuclear warheads. Why? We have <a
href="https://www.sublant.usff.navy.mil/About-Us/Submarine-Facts/">so
many already</a>. And as the only nation that has ever used nuclear
weapons in war (in 1945) and has <a
href="https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2024-07/focus/looming-threat-renewed-us-nuclear-testing">tested</a>,
perfected, and helped <a
href="https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/nuclear-weapons-who-has-what-glance">proliferate</a>
the technology of ultimate destruction for the last eight decades, the
United States should be leading the charge to denuclearize, disarm, and
abolish such weaponry. That, after all, is what’s called for in the <a
href="https://disarmament.unoda.org/wmd/nuclear/tpnw/">Treaty on the
Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons</a>.</p>
<p>If we are ever going to break our MAD addiction, one place to start
is here on Howard Street with people who make their living working on
one tiny component of this incredibly complex system. <a
href="https://ips-dc.org/from-a-militarized-to-a-decarbonized-economy-a-case-for-conversion/">Economic
conversion</a>, moving resources and skills and jobs from the
military-industrial complex to civilian sectors, is a big project. And
it could indeed begin right here on Howard Street.</p>
<p><strong>You Get What You Pay For</strong></p>
<p>Our small town is also home to the Coast Guard Academy and two
private colleges. Add the acreage of those three non-taxpaying
institutions to the nearly 30 churches, synagogues, and other houses of
worship that enjoy tax-free status here; throw in the dozens of
nonprofits that do all the good work<strong> </strong>and you end up
with an awfully small tax base. As a result, the municipal budget leans
heavily on commercial taxpayers like <a
href="https://www.gdeb.com/">General Dynamics Electric Boat</a>, the
military-industrial behemoth that moved into 24 acres of prime
waterfront real estate in 2009 after it was vacated by the tax scofflaw
<a
href="https://ij.org/ll/the-end-of-an-eminent-domain-error-pfizer-closes-in-new-london/">Pfizer</a>.</p>
<p>General Dynamics, like other military manufacturers, essentially only
has one customer to please, the United States government. That makes
the cost-plus contracting scheme even more egregious, guaranteeing that,
no matter what goes wrong, its profits are always assured. Such a
bonkers, counter-capitalist scenario passes all the costs on to American
taxpayers and allows the privately held corporation to pocket all the
profits, while handing out fat dividends to its shareholders. According
to <a
href="https://www.sahmcapital.com/news/content/we-think-shareholders-are-less-likely-to-approve-a-large-pay-rise-for-general-dynamics-corporations-nysegd-ceo-for-now-2024-04-25">Sahm
Capitol</a>, “Over the past three years, General Dynamics’ Earnings Per
Share grew by 3.7% and over the past three years, the total shareholder
return was 62%.”</p>
<p>For 2024, General Dynamics Electric Boat is paying taxes on property
valued at $90.8 million — almost twice as much as that of the next
highest taxpayer in our town. But it is also a bone of contention. The
company, which paid <a href="https://aflcio.org/paywatch/GD">CEO Phebe
Novakovic</a> $22.5 million in salary and stock awards in 2023, has no
trouble taking the City of New London to court when they feel like their
property is being overvalued or overtaxed. They win, too, so their
property valuations yo-yo year to year when New London has been ordered
to repay taxes to General Dynamics. Whether they pay taxes based on
$90.8 million in property or $57 million doesn’t really matter to the
company. It’s literal pocket change to the Pentagon’s <a
href="https://dsm.forecastinternational.com/2024/03/01/top-100-defense-contractors-2023/">third
largest weapons contractor</a>, a company that boasted $42.3 billion in
revenue in 2023. But it matters a lot in a place like New London, where
the annual budget process routinely shaves jobs from the schools, public
works, and the civil service to make the columns all add up.</p>
<p>According to a <a
href="https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/files/cow/imce/papers/2017/Job%20Opportunity%20Cost%20of%20War%20-%20HGP%20-%20FINAL.pdf">report</a>by
Heidi Garrett-Peltier for the Costs of War Project at Brown University,
$1 million of federal spending in the military sector creates 6.9 jobs
(5.8 direct jobs and 1.1 in the supply chain). That same $1 million
would create 8.4 jobs in the wind energy sector or 9.5 jobs in solar
energy. Investing $1 million in energy efficiency retrofits creates 10.6
jobs. Use that $1 million to build streets or highways or tunnels or
bridges or to repair schools and it will create “over 40 percent more
jobs than the military, with a total multiplier of 9.8 jobs per $1
million spending.”</p>
<p>Wait, what? Are you telling me that, with their lack of transparency,
accountability, and their cost-plus contracts, while building weapons
systems for the sole purpose of destruction and wasting a lot of money
in the process, the military-industrial complex is a lousy job creator?
Am I to understand that spending money on just about <em>anything</em>
else creates more jobs and more economic activity, while not threatening
the world with annihilation?</p>
<p>As I work on a local level in my small town in Connecticut, I see how
municipal policy should prioritize small businesses, mom-and-pop stores
made of brick and mortar, over multinational corporations or big
business. I see the return on investment from a small business in
granular and tangible ways: the grocery store owner who starts each day
by picking up garbage in his parking lot, the funeral home that sponsors
the Little League team, the woman at the art gallery and frame shop who
waters the street flowers, or the self-employed local photographer who
serves on the board of the cooperative grocery store.</p>
<p>These businesses don’t employ tens of thousands of people, but they
also don’t insist on tax abatements that undermine our local budget or
fill our crowded streets with commuters hell-bent on getting away from
the office and our town as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>You get what you pay for, right? Garrett-Peltier’s Costs of War
report goes on to note that “healthcare spending creates more than twice
as many jobs for the same level of spending, while education creates up
to nearly three times as many jobs as defense spending… The employment
multipliers for these domestic programs are 14.3 for healthcare, 19.2
for primary and secondary education, and 11.2 for higher education; the
average figure for education is 15.2 jobs per $1 million spending.”</p>
<p>These are numbers I wish my City Council would commit to memory. In
fact, we should all know these numbers by heart, because they counter
the dominant narrative that military spending is good for the economy
and that good-paying jobs depend on militarism.</p>
<p>The United States is investing trillions of dollars in the military,
as well as in weapons contractors like General Dynamics, Boeing, and
Lockheed Martin. Every U.S. president in modern history has prioritized
the bottom lines of those corporations over a safe and healthy future
for the next generation. Consider all of that as just so many symptoms
of Militarism Abuse Syndrome. Isn’t it finally time to get really mad at
MAD? Let’s kick the habit and get clean!</p>
