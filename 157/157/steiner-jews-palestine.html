<p class="intro">Many intelligent people will find it superfluous to speak about the
strange gathering that took place in Basel a few days ago under the name
"Zionist Congress." The fact that a number of European Jews came
together to promote the idea of establishing a new Palestinian empire
and encouraging the Jews to emigrate to this new "promised land" was
seen to be the insane idea of a morbidly excited fantasy. In this
judgment, they calmed down. They did not discuss the matter anymore. I
believe, however, that these wise men have lagged ten years behind in
their judgments. And ten years is a small eternity in our time when
events are flowing so fast. Ten years ago, with some justification, one
could think that a Jew was half mad who had the idea of ​​moving his
people to Palestine. Today one may only consider him hypersensitive and
vain; but in another ten years things can be very different.</p>
<p>However, in the case of Herzl and Nordau, the present leaders of the
Zionist movement, I think it is more about vanity than a sensitivity to
a perceived increase in antisemitism. The commonplace phrases that Herzl
put forward in his booklet "The Jewish State" (M. Breitenstein's
bookstore, Leipzig and Vienna, 1896) and the verbal fluff with which the
sensationalist Nordau in Basel delighted his listeners are certainly not
from the deepest depths of troubled souls. But they come from
intelligent minds who know what has the strongest effect on Jews who
have a sensitive heart and a sophisticated sense of self-respect. These
latter members of the Jewish people will, in my opinion, become
followers of Herzl and Nordau. And the number of these members is
certainly not small.</p>
<p>What good is it to emphasize so often that the Jews who feel this way
are in serious error? They turn their eyes away from the great progress
that the Jews have made in recent decades, the emancipation of the Jews,
and only see that they are still excluded from certain places, and
certain rights are still abridged; and, moreover, they hear that they
are being insulted by the antisemites in the most desperate way. They do
so because their hurt feelings cloud their minds. They are unable to see
the powerlessness of antisemitism; they only see its drive and its
outrageous excesses. They doubt whoever tells them: look at how futile
the machinations of the hate of the Jews is, and how all their endeavors
end in disgrace.</p>
<p>They listen only to those who say to them like Theodor Herzl: <em>"In
the populations, anti<em>s</em>emitism is growing daily, hourly,
and must continue to grow, because the causes persist and cannot be
remedied. ... Our welfare seems to contain something provocative,
because for many centuries the world has been accustomed to seeing in us
the most despicable of the poor. At the same time one does not realize,
out of ignorance or narrow-mindedness, that our welfare weakens us as
Jews and extinguishes our peculiarities. Only the pressure presses us
back to the old tribe, only the hatred of our surroundings makes us
strangers again. So we are and will remain, whether we like it or not, a
historical group of recognizable togetherness. We are one people; the
enemy makes us such against our will, as has always
        been the case in history".</em></p>
<p>And those with whom such words resonate most powerfully today were
only a short time ago passionately prepared to merge their ethnicity
into that of the West. It is not real antisemitism that is the cause of
this Jewish over-sensitivity, but the false image of an over-excited
fantasy of the anti-Jewish movement. Anyone who has anything to do with
Jews knows how deep-seated among the best of its people is the tendency
to form such a false image. Mistrust of the non-Jew has thoroughly
seized their souls. They also suspect people in whom they can perceive
no trace of conscious antisemitism; they suspect an unconscious,
instinctive, secret hatred of the Jews at the bottom of the soul. I
count it among the most beautiful fruits that could drive human
inclination if every trace of suspicion between a Jew and a non-Jew were
extinguished. To exclude such inclinations I would call a victory over human nature.
.</p>
<p>There may come a time when the sphere of Jewish personalities becomes
so irritated that any understanding with non-Jews becomes impossible.
What counts in the so-called Jewish question is sensible arguments and
plans, not the tearing of intimate threads between Jew and non-Jew, or
the rise of emotional tendencies, or a thousand unspeakable things. It
would be best if there were as little talk as possible in this matter.
Only the mutual actions of individuals should be valued. It does not
matter if someone is Jewish or German: if I find him nice, I like him;
if he is disgusting, I avoid him. This is so simple that it is almost
silly when you say it. But how foolish you have to be to say the
opposite!</p>
<p>I think the antisemites are harmless people. The best of them are
like children. They want to have something to blame for the ill they
suffer. When a child drops a plate, he looks for somebody or something
that has bumped it to blame for the accident. He does not look for the
cause, the fault, in himself. That is what the antisemites do. Many
people feel bad. They look for something to blame. The circumstances
have brought it about that many currently see this something in
Judaism.</p>
<p>Much worse than the antisemites are the heartless leaders of the
Europe-weary Jews, Herzl and Nordau. They turn an unpleasant
childishness into a world-history stream; they turn harmless banter into
terrible cannon fire. They are seducers, tempters of their people. They
sacrifice the understanding that all reasonable people should desire
to their own vanity, which thirsts for programs, because where deeds
are lacking the right program is established.</p>
<p>However harmless antisemitism is in itself, it becomes dangerous when
the Jews see it in the light Herzl and Nordau put it in.</p>
<p>And they understand the language of the tempters, these masters:
<em>"One will pray in the temples for the success of our work. But
in the churches too! It is the solution of an old pressure under which
all suffered. But first of all light must be shed on minds. The idea
must fly out to the last miserable nests where our people live. They
will wake up from their dull brooding. For in all our lives comes a new
content. Everyone only needs to think about it themselves, and the train
will be a mighty one. And what glory awaits those fighters for the
cause! That is why I believe that a generation of Jews will grow out of
the earth. The Maccabees will rise again." </em>So writes Theodor
Herzl in his "The Jewish State".</p>
<p>I fear there will come a time when the Jews will no longer believe
what we non-Jews tell them about antisemitism, in favor of parroting
their Jewish seducers. And like so many beguiled people, they will
translate the empty phrases of these deceivers into the language of
their hearts. The seduced will suffer; but the seducers will triumph
over the success that their vanity has achieved.</p>
<p>In Basil the question has been basically decided: what should be done
to make the solution of the Jewish question as impossible as it possibly
could be? Whether Herzl and Nordau really believe that their Palestinian
Empire can be established, I am not in a position to say. I
hypothesize, in honor of their intelligence, that they do not believe in
it. If I am right in this assumption, then one must blame these leaders
for placing more obstacles between Jews and non-Jews than the
antisemitic agitators.</p>
<p>The Zionist movement is an enemy of Judaism. The Jews would do best
to look closely at the people who paint ghosts for them.</p>

<p>Editor’s note: This article was written in 1897, long before Hitler
and National Socialism came to power in Germany and perpetrated the
holocaust. So Rudolf Steiner was wrong about the “harmlessness” of
antisemitism. When one considers, however, what is happening today in
the Jewish state of Israel and Gaza, it becomes possible to think that
he may have been right about the temptation of Zionism. FTS</p>
