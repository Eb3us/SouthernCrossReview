<h3>Freeing the World from the Deadly Shadow of Genocide and Ecocide</h3>
<h2>By <a href="https://tomdispatch.com/authors/williamastore/">William J. Astore</a></h2>

<main>
<p class="intro">When I was in the U.S. military, I learned a saying (often <a
href="https://www.dialogues-de-platon.org/faq/faq008.htm">wrongly
attributed</a> to the Greek philosopher Plato) that only the dead have
seen the end of war. Its persistence through history to this very moment
should indeed be sobering. What would it take for us humans to stop
killing each other with such vigor and in such numbers?</p>
<p>Song lyrics tell me <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KoXt9pZLGM">to be proud</a> to be
an American, yet war and profligate preparations for more of the same
are omnipresent here. My government spends more on its military than the
<a
href="https://www.pgpf.org/blog/2023/04/the-united-states-spends-more-on-defense-than-the-next-10-countries-combined">next
10 countries</a> combined (and most of them are allies). In this
century, our leaders have twice warned of an “<a
href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/01/29/bush-axis-of-evil-2002-1127725">axis
of evil</a>” intent on harming us, whether the fantasy troika of Iraq,
Iran, and North Korea cited by President George W. Bush early in 2002 or
<a
href="https://www.voanews.com/a/china-not-russia-still-tops-list-of-threats-to-us/7534999.html">a
new one</a> — China, Russia, and North Korea — in the Indo-Pacific
today. Predictably given that sort of threat inflation, this country is
now <a href="https://tomdispatch.com/spending-unlimited-2/">closing in
on</a> a trillion dollars a year in “<a
href="https://bracingviews.substack.com/p/the-pentagon-ate-our-government">defense
spending</a>,” or close to two-thirds of federal discretionary spending,
in the name of having a military machine capable of defeating “evil”
troikas (as well as combatting global terrorism). A significant part of
that huge sum is reserved for producing a <a
href="https://www.businessinsider.com/nuclear-modernization-plans-are-unnecessarily-costly-and-risky-2021-7">new
generation</a> of nuclear weapons that will be quite capable of
destroying this planet with missiles and warheads to spare.</p>
<p><span id="anchor"></span>My country, to be blunt, has long been <a
href="https://tomdispatch.com/william-astore-confessions-of-a-recovering-weapons-addict/">addicted</a>
to war, killing, violence, and massive preparations for more of the
same. We need an intervention. We need to confront our addiction. Yet
when it comes to war and preparations for future conflicts, our leaders
aren’t even close to hitting rock bottom. They remain in remarkable
denial and see no reason to change their ways.</p>
<p>To cite two recent examples: Just before Easter weekend this year,
President Biden swore he was personally <a
href="https://www.reuters.com/world/biden-acknowledges-pain-arab-americans-over-war-gaza-2024-03-29">devastated</a>
by Palestinian suffering in Gaza. At the same time, his administration
insisted that a United Nations Security Council resolution for a
ceasefire in Gaza that it allowed to pass was “<a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4ohUMB9Wjg">non-binding</a>” and,
perhaps to make that very point, reportedly <a
href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/03/29/us-weapons-israel-gaza-war/">shipped</a>
1,800 MK84 2,000-pound bombs and 500 MK82 500-pound bombs off to Israel,
assumedly to be used in — yes! — Gaza.</p>
<p>The Biden administration refuses to see the slightest contradiction
in such a stance. Men like Joe Biden and his chief diplomat Antony
Blinken confess to being disturbed, <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxnpY0owPkA">even shocked</a>, by
the devastation our bombs deliver. Who knew Israel would use them to
kill or wound <a
href="https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20240403-gaza-death-toll-nears-33000/">more
than 100,000</a> Palestinians? Who knew that they’d reduce <a
href="https://chrishedges.substack.com/p/a-genocide-foretold">significant
parts of Gaza</a> to rubble? Who knew that a blank check of support for
Israel would enable that country to — it’s hard not to use the phrase —
offer a final solution to the Gaza question?</p>
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1642598348/ref=nosim/?tag=tomdispatch-20">
<div class="polaroid">
<img class="b" src="obsolete-past.png" alt="On Shedding an Obsolete Past" style="width:100%">
<div class="container"><p>Buy the Book!</p></div></div></a>
<p>Not to be outdone by the Democrats, Republican Congressman Tim
Walberg of Michigan recently cited the examples of <a
href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/gop-rep-tim-walberg-suggests-gaza-handled-nagasaki-hiroshima-rcna145752">Hiroshima
and Nagasaki</a> in seeking a “quick” end to the conflict in Gaza
(before walking his comments back somewhat). For him, Israel remains
America’s greatest ally, whatever <a
href="https://www.caitlinjohnst.one/p/israels-savage-destruction-of-gazas">its
actions</a>, even as he argues that Palestinians in Gaza merit no
humanitarian aid from the United States whatsoever.</p>
<p>With that horrifying spectacle — and given the TV news and social
media, it truly has been a spectacle! — of genocide in Gaza, America’s
leaders have embraced the very worst of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niccolò_Machiavelli">Machiavelli</a>,
preferring to be feared rather than loved, while putting power first and
principle last. Former National Security Adviser and Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger, recently deceased, rightly vilified for pursuing a <a
href="https://direct.mit.edu/isec/article/43/1/7/12204/The-Rarity-of-Realpolitik-What-Bismarck-s">Bismarckian
Realpolitik</a>, and deeply involved in the devastation of Vietnam,
Cambodia, and Laos, might even have blanched at the full-throttled
support for war (and weapons sales) now being pursued by this country’s
leaders. Dividing the world into armed camps based on fear seems basic
to our foreign policy, a reality now echoed in domestic politics as
well, as the Democratic blue team and the MAGA Republican red team
attack each other as “fascistic” or worse. In this all-American world of
ours, all is conflict, all is war.</p>
<p>When asked about such an addiction to war, your average government
official will likely claim it’s not our fault. “Freedom isn’t free,” so
the bumper sticker says, meaning in practice that this country stands
prepared to kill others without mercy to ensure its “way of life,” which
also in practice means unbridled consumption by an ever-shrinking
portion of Americans and unapologetic profiteering by the richest and
greediest of us. Call it the “moderate” bipartisan consensus within the
Washington Beltway. Only an “extremist” would dare call for restraint,
tolerance, diplomacy, and peace.</p>
<p><strong>A Common Cause to Unify Humanity</strong></p>
<p>Short of an attack on Earth by aliens, it’s hard to imagine the U.S.
today making common cause with “enemies” like China, Iran, North Korea,
or Russia. What gives? Isn’t there a better way and, if so, how would we
get there?</p>
<p>In fact, there is a common foe — or perhaps a common cause — that
should unite us all as humans. That cause is Earth, the health of our
planet and all the life forms on it. And that foe, to state the obvious
(even if it regularly goes unsaid), is war, which is unhealthy in the
extreme not just for us but for our planet, too.</p>
<p>War turns people into killers — of our fellow humans, of course, but
also of all forms of life within our (often very large) blast radii. In
addition, war is a mass distraction from what should truly matter to us:
the sacredness of life and the continued viability of our planet and its
ecology. Call it a cliché but there’s no way to deny it: there is indeed
only one Spaceship Earth. As far as we know now, our planet is the sole
body in the universe teeming with life. Of course, the universe is
incomprehensibly vast and there could well be other forms of life out
there, but we don’t know that, not with certainty anyway.</p>
<p>Imagine, in a dystopic future, America’s “best and brightest” (or the
“best and brightest” of another country) acting in a nuclear fury,
employing the very weaponry that <a
href="https://www.ucsusa.org/nuclear-weapons/worldwide">continues to
proliferate</a> but hasn’t been used since the destruction of two
Japanese cities on August 6 and 9, 1945, and so crippling Spaceship
Earth. Imagine also that our planet is truly the universe’s one
magnificent and magical spot of life. Wouldn’t it be hard then to
imagine a worse crime, not just against humanity, but life itself
cosmically? There would be no recompense, no forgiveness, no redemption
— and possibly no recovery either.</p>
<p>Of course, I don’t know if God (or gods) exists. Though I was raised
a Catholic, I find myself essentially an agnostic today. Yet I do
believe in the sacredness of life in all its diversity. And as tenacious
as life may be, given our constant pursuit of war, I fear the worst.</p>
<p>If you’re of a certain age, you may recall when the astronauts on
Apollo 8 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VraZdvxe1Jc">witnessed
earthrise</a> as their spaceship orbited the moon in 1968. The crew <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njpWalYduU4">read</a> from
Genesis, though in truth it could have been from any creation story we
humans have ever imagined to account for how we and our world came to
be. Specific religions or creeds didn’t truly matter at that moment, nor
should they now. What mattered was the sense of awe we felt as we first
viewed the Earth from space in its full glory but also all its
fragility.</p>
<p>For make no mistake, this planet is fragile. Its ecosystems can be
destroyed. Not for nothing did the inventor of the atomic bomb, J.
Robert Oppenheimer, turn to the <a
href="https://www.businessinsider.com/oppenheimer-famous-quote-become-death-destroyer-worlds-from-hindu-scripture-2023-7">Hindu
scriptures to intone</a>, “Now I am become death, the destroyer of
worlds,” when he saw the first atomic device explode and expand into a
mushroom cloud during the Trinity test in New Mexico in July 1945.</p>
<p>In the febrile postwar climate of anti-communism that would all too
soon follow, America’s leaders would decide that atomic bombs weren’t
faintly destructive enough. What they needed were thermonuclear bombs,
1,000 times more destructive, to fight World War III against the “<a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0YpTfXZdyo">big fat commie
rat</a>.” Now nine (9!) nations have nuclear weapons, with more
undoubtedly hankering to join the club. So how long before mushroom
clouds soar toward the stratosphere again? How long before we experience
some version of planetary ecocide via a nuclear exchange and the <a
href="https://climate.envsci.rutgers.edu/pdf/WiresClimateChangeNW.pdf">nuclear
winter</a> that could follow it?</p>
<p><strong>Genocide and Ecocide on a Planetary Scale</strong></p>
<p>The genocide happening in Gaza today may foreshadow one possible
future for this planet. The world’s lone superpower, its self-styled
beacon of freedom, now dismisses U.N. Security Council resolutions to
stop the killing as “non-binding.” Meanwhile, Israel, whose founding was
a response to a Holocaust inflicted during World War II and whose people
collectively said Never Again, is now killing, starving, and displacing
hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in the name of righteous vengeance
for Hamas’s October 7th attack.</p>
<p>If the U.S. and Israel can spin mass murder in Palestine as not just
defensible, but even positive (“defeating Hamas terrorists”), what hope
do we have as a species? Is this the future we have to look forward to,
an endless echoing of our murderous past?</p>
<p>I refuse to believe it. It truly should be possible to imagine and
work toward something better. Yet, in all honesty, it’s hard to imagine
new paths being blazed by such fossilized thinkers as Joe Biden and
Donald Trump.</p>
<p>“Don’t trust anyone over thirty” was a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Weinberg">telling
catchphrase</a> of the 1960s. Now, we’re being told as Americans that
we’ll have to place our trust in one of two men almost at or exceeding
80 years of age. Entrusting and empowering <a
href="https://bracingviews.substack.com/p/depression-thy-name-is-bidentrump">political
dinosaurs</a>, however, represents an almost surefire path toward future
extinction-level events.</p>
<p>Let me turn instead to a 25-year-old who did imagine a better future,
even as he protested in the most extreme way imaginable the genocide in
Gaza. This February, fellow airman Aaron Bushnell lit <a
href="https://bracingviews.substack.com/p/airman-sets-himself-on-fire-to-protest">himself
on fire</a> outside the Israeli embassy in Washington, D.C. He
sacrificed his life in a most public way to challenge us to do
something, anything, to stop genocide. America’s “leaders” answered him
by ignoring his sacrifice and sending more bombs, thousands of them, to
Israel.</p>
<p>Aaron Bushnell did, however, imagine a better world. As he explained
last year in a <a
href="https://www.caitlinjohnst.one/p/violent-extremists-get-called-moderates">private
post</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I’ve realized that a lot of the difference between me and my less
radical friends is that they are less capable of imagining a better
world than I am. I follow YouTubers like Andrewism that fill my head
with concrete images of free, post-scarcity communities and it makes me
so much more prepared to reject things about the current world, because
I’ve imagined how things could be and that helps me see how extremely
bullshit things are right now.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“What I’m trying to say is, it’s so important to imagine a better
world. Let your thoughts run wild with idealistic dreams of what the
world <em>should</em> look like and let the pain and anger at how it’s
not that way flow through you. Let it free your mind and fuel your rage
against the machine.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“It’s not too late for you or anyone. We can have the world of our
dreams tomorrow, but we have to be willing to fight today.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His all-too-public suicide was a fiery cry of despair, but also a
plea for a better future, one free of mass murder.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, millions of people across America witnessed a
total eclipse of the sun. It’s awe-inspiring, even a bit alarming, to
see the sun disappear in the middle of the day. Those watching took
comfort in knowing that it would reappear from behind the moon in a
matter of seconds or minutes and so gloried in that fleeting moment of
preternatural darkness.</p>
<p>But imagine if the moon and sun were somehow to become permanently
stuck in place. Imagine that darkness was our future — our only future.
Sadly enough, however, it’s not the moon but we humans who can
potentially cast the Earth into lasting darkness. Via the nuclear winter
that could result from a nuclear conflict on this planet, we could
indeed cast a shadow between the sun and life itself, a power of
destruction that, tragically, may far exceed our current level of
wisdom.</p>
<p>We know from history that it’s far easier to destroy than to create,
far easier to kill than to preserve. Yet when countries make genocide or
ecocide (from nuclear winter) possible and defensible (as a sign of
uncompromising “toughness” and perhaps the defense of “freedom”), you
know that their leaders are, in some sense, <a
href="https://peaceandplanetnews.org/biden-is-quietly-funding-nuclear-weapons-upgrades-that-could-imperil-the-planet/">morally
obtuse monsters</a>. And who or what are we if we choose to follow such
monsters?</p>
<p>As human populations rise, as vital resources like water, food, and
fuel shrink, as this planet grows ever hotter thanks to our intervention
and our excesses, we’ll need to cooperate more than ever to ensure our
mutual survival. Far too often, however, America’s strategic thinkers
dismiss cooperation through diplomacy or otherwise as naïve, unreliable,
and impractical. “Competition” through zero-sum games, war, or other
hyperviolent urges seems so much more “reasonable,” so much more
“human.”</p>
<p>To the victor goes the spoils, so it’s said. But a planet despoiled
by thermonuclear war, cast into darkness, ravaged by radiation, disease,
and death, would, of course, offer no victory to anyone. Unless we put
our efforts into ending war, rather than continuing to war on one
another, such conflicts will, sooner or later, undoubtedly put an end to
us.</p>
<p>In reality, our worst enemy isn’t some “axis” or other combination of
imagined foes from without, it’s within. We remain the world’s most
dangerous species, the one capable of wiping out most or all of the
rest, not to speak of ourselves, with our folly. So, as Aaron Bushnell
wrote, free your mind. Collectively, there must be a better way for all
creatures, great and small, on this fragile spaceship of ours.</p>
