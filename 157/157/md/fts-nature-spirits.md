Nicolás and Carolina were lost in the woods and didn't know which
way to turn. Whichever way they went they seemed to get more lost.
They sat down on the roots of a tree and Carolina began to cry.
Her brother told her not to cry, that they would find their way
out eventually, but the truth was that he felt like crying too.

Suddenly, they heard a faint sound of someone moaning:
"Oh, oh! help me! oh, oh!" They held their breath and waited. It
happened again: "Oh, oh!"

"Maybe it's only the wind," Nicolás said.

"No, it's someone crying for help," Carolina objected.
"What should we do?"

Nicolás thought for a moment. He was older so he had
to make the decisions. "Let's go to where the sound is coming
from. If it's only the wind we won't find anything. If someone
needs help we'll help them if we can."

They stood up and walked towards the sound, which was
repeated every few seconds. Finally they came upon a fallen tree.
A leg was sticking out from under it. The cries for help were
coming from under the tree's branches. They looked at each other,
then back at the leg. "A child must be under there," Nicolás said.

"Don't just stand there, get me out!" a man's voice
cried.

They tried to lift the tree, but it was heavy and they
couldn't hold it up.

"Wait, I have an idea," Nicolás said. There was a
large, round rock nearby, which he rolled up to the tree. "When I
lift the tree you roll the rock under it, Carolina." He grabbed
the tree-trunk with both hands and lifted with all his strength.
"Now!" he cried. Carolina was on her knees. She pushed as hard as
she could and the rock rolled under the tree. Then Nicolás dropped
it on the rock.

"Get me out!" the voice shouted again.

"Nicolás took hold of the leg and pulled. Another leg
appeared which Carolina grabbed and they dragged a strange little
man from under the tree. When he stood up and brushed himself off,
they saw that he wasn't any taller than Nicolás. He wore a pointed
green hat, green shirt and pants, no shoes and had a white beard
that reached to his waist.

"They ought to teach these trees better manners than
to fall on a body when he's sleeping," the little man growled.

"It wasn't the tree's fault," Carolina said.

          The little man looked surprised. "It wasn't mine,
either,"  he said.

"Aren't you going to say thank you?" Carolina asked
him.

"Don't be fresh, Carolina," Nicolás told her.

The little man looked from one to the other and ran
his fingers through his beard. "No, Carolina is right." He took
off his hat, bowed almost to the ground and said, "Thank you
kindly."

![](bosque2.jpg){class="a"}

Carolina giggled. The little man straightened up, put
his hat back on and laughed heartily.

"Now, my lovelies, tell me what you are doing alone so
deep in the forest."

"We're lost," Nicolás said.

"Lost, are we. And how did that happen?"

"We were going to our Aunt Nélida's house and we were
supposed to take the train that goes around the forest," Nicolás
explained. "But we decided to walk through it instead and we got
lost."

"Did you walk to save the carfare?"

"Yes."

"Are you poor?"

"Oh no," Carolina said. "We live in a nice house."

"We wanted to see if we could do it, too," Nicolás
added.

"Hmm, foolhardy, my boy, foolhardy."

"Can you tell us how to get to Aunt Nélida's?"
Carolina asked.

The little man stroked his beard. "I think I can help
you there, but first you must promise me not to come alone so deep
into the forest again, at least not until you're older."

"Oh, we won't," Carolina said. "Our mamá and papá and
Aunt Nélida are going to be worried about us."

He looked at Nicolás, who said, "Yes, sir."

"Good. Now, I don't know where your Aunt Nélida lives,
but I have some friends who can show you. Help me gather some
kindling wood. We'll need a fire anyway if were going to roast the
potatoes I have in my knapsack."

They gathered kindling wood and dry leaves and the
little man pulled a match the size of a pencil from his coat
pocket and struck it on the rock that was still holding up the
tree. Soon a fire was crackling away. "Now watch". He bent down,
picked up a twig that had fallen from the kindling, and drew a
figure on the ground:

![](tri-down.jpg){class="a"}

"Are you there, Rusty?" he called. "Ah yes, there you
are."

"Where?" Carolina asked, looking around.

"Look into the fire."

They looked into the fire and saw a small figure of
flame smiling at them.

![](bosque4.jpg){class="a"}

"That's Rusty Salamander," the little man said. "Tell
us, Rusty-- Where does Aunt Nélida live?"

Rusty Salamander shot out his arm, which was a tongue
of flame, to his right and nodded his head three times. Then he
disappeared, or at least they could no longer see him. Only
dancing flames were visible in the fire.

The little man looked in the direction Rusty
Salamander had indicated. "The south-west," he said, "where the
sun will soon be. After we eat these potatoes you go that way.
Just follow the sun and you'll soon reach your Aunt Nélida's." He
poured a pile of potatoes from his knapsack onto the ground and
pushed the twig through one of them and held it close over the
fire. "Find twigs and stick them through some potatoes. They're
delicious".

The children gladly followed his instructions and they
were soon eating the roasted potatoes, which were indeed
delicious.

"How far is it to Aunt Nélida's?" Nicolás asked the
little man.

"It's not far to the end of the woods. Once you're out
of the woods you can find it, can't you?"

"Sure, " Nicolás said.

The little man looked at them both, one after the
other, then he smiled and the skin at the corners of his eyes
crinkled. "You both look tired. You should have a nap, but before
you do I'm going to show you the signs you can use to call my
other friends in case you need them".

He squatted and scratched out three more signs next to
the Rusty Salamander sign. This is what he drew:

![](bosque5.jpg){class="a"}

"You can use the first sign to call Nebenezar Gnome,
the second is to call Beatrix Nixie and the third is to call
Sylvia Sylph," he said, pointing to each sign as he said the name.

"How will we know which one to call?" Nicolás asked.

"Oh, that's easy. If you have an earth problem you
call Ebenezer Gnome, if it's a water problem you call Beatrix
Nixie and if the problem has something to do with air, you call
Sylvia Sylph. But only call if you really need them. And you have
to draw the correct sign first. Will you remember them?"

Carolina, who was sitting against a tree, closed her
eyes and her head dropped onto her chest. She had fallen asleep.
But Nicolás stared at the signs and said that he would remember
them.

"Now rest," the little man said. "You have a long way
to go and the forest can be tricky and dangerous." Nicolás
suddenly felt very sleepy. He lay back and fell asleep on the soft
forest ground.

Carolina was the first to wake up. "Nicolás," she
cried, "where's the little man?" Nicolás sat up and rubbed his
eyes and looked around. Loose earth covered the place where the
fire had been. The  signs the little man had scratched in the
ground were no longer there. "He must have erased them", Nicolás
said.

"What?"

"The signs. But never mind, let's go."

They set off following the sun in the south-west.
After what seemed a long time but wasn't really, they heard
thunder and saw a lightning bolt in the sky. "It's going to rain,"
said Nicolás. "Look, there's a place we can take shelter." Off to
their right was a hill with a cave in its base. They ran to it and
scrambled inside. They huddled together and watched the rain fall
in sheets outside. Suddenly lightning struck the hill above them
and a huge rock fell across the entrance of the cave, shutting
them in. Nicolás pushed the rock but it didn't move.

"What are we going to do now?" Carolina asked him.

Nicolás thought a moment, then took from his pocket
the twig the little man had used to scratch the signs in the
ground and drew one of them on the floor of the cave:

![](tri-2.gif){class="a"}

"Ebenezer Gnome, please come and help us." They waited. At first
nothing happened, then they heard a noise behind them. They turned
around and saw a boy dressed all in brown, who was about as high
as Nicolás's knees. He walked between them, kicked the rock and it
fell away as though it were a pebble. Then he walked back into the
interior of the cave, smiling shyly as he passed them.

![](bosque6.jpg){class="a"}

"Thank you, Ebenezer Gnome," Carolina said.

The children crawled out of the cave into the
sunlight. The forest was wet from the rain and everything seemed
to shine. They continued on their way, still following the sun,
which was now farther down in the sky. They soon came to a rapidly
flowing river. It wasn't very wide but it seemed deep. Not far
downstream a tree that had been struck by lightning lay across the
river.

"We can cross on that tree," Nicolás said. They
climbed onto the base of the tree where its roots were and started
across, Nicolás leading the way. When they were at midstream a
branch on the other side cracked because of the extra weight and
the trunk they were on turned, just a little, but it was enough to
make Nicolás lose his balance and fall into the river. Carolina
fell onto the trunk and hugged it so she wouldn't fall off. She
watched in horror as her brother was swept downstream. She
remembered the water-being's name and hoped she would get the sign
right. She pulled a hair-clip from her ponytail and scratched the
water sign as well as she could onto the bark of the tree:

![](tri-3.gif){class="a"}

"Beatrix Nixie, Please come," she cried. "Help Nicolás".

No sooner had she pronounced the word "Nixie", than a
green-haired girl in a blue dress rose from the water in front of
Nicolás and raised her arm. The river's current reversed and
brought Nicolás rushing back to Carolina. She gave him her hand
and he climbed back up onto the tree. He rested a while and then
they made their way to the other bank.

![](bosque7.jpg){class="a"}

As they walked on Carolina said, "Do you think
something else is going to happen, Nico?"

"I don't know. But if it does, we have our friends to
help us."

"We're really lucky to have met that little man,"
Carolina said.

Something else did happen. They came to a very deep
chasm that extended on both sides as far as they could see and was
about ten yards wide.

"What are we going to do now, Nico?" Carolina asked
her brother.

The sun was now so low in the sky that they could no
longer see it, only its glow above the trees. If they couldn't get
across the chasm soon they'd have to spend the night in the woods.
Nicolás's clothes were still wet and it was beginning to get
cold. 

Nicolás felt in his pocket, but the twig was gone. He
picked up another and scratched the air sign on the ground:

![](tri-4.gif){class="a"}

"Sylvia Sylph, are you there?" he called. The figure of a little
girl, even smaller than Ebenezer Gnome, appeared before them. She
was hard to see because she was transparent and flowed from place
to place without touching the ground.

"We have to get across the chasm, Sylvia Sylph. Can
you help us?" Nicolás said.        

Sylvia Sylph smiled and came closer. They felt a rush
of warm air under them that lifted them up high over the chasm and
set them down softly on the other side.

![](bosque8.jpg){class="a"}

"Oh, thank you, Sylvia," Carolina said, but Sylvia
Sylph was nowhere to be seen.

"Come on, Carolina," Nicolás said, "before it gets
dark".

It didn't take them long to reach the edge of the
forest from where they could see Aunt Nélida's farmhouse with its
lights already on. They ran towards it. When they were almost
there they turned and looked back at the forest. The little man
stood at its edge, with Rusty Salamander and Ebenezer Gnome on his
left and Beatrix Nixie and Sylvia Sylph on his right. He wore a
white tunic with a golden star embossed on it, which glowed in the
twilight through his beard.

![](tri-5.gif){class="a"}



Carolina and Nicolás waved to them and all five waved
back. Then they vanished.

"The Star-man, that's what I'll call him," Carolina
said.

"Yeah," Nicolás agreed, "That's who he must be."

When Carolina and Nicolás entered the kitchen, Aunt
Nélida was cooking dinner.

"Hi," she said. "I was just about to call your mother.
I thought you were going to take an earlier train."

"We came through the forest," Nicolás said. "That's
why we're late."

Aunt Nélida laughed. "Oh really?" She didn't believe
that two small children could walk alone through the forest.

"But we won't do it again, not till we're older,"
Carolina said. "We promised the Star-man."

Aunt Nélida looked at them more closely and saw that
Nico’s clothes were still wet. Then they told her everything that
had happened to them. They repeated the story often after that.
Many grown-ups didn't believe them, but the children did. And so,
finally, did their Aunt Nélida and their mamá and papá.
