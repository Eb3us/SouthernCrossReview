# Coming Clean

## by Lynn Strongin

Georgia O'Keeffe as a child\
always ate round the raisin in the cookie:\
sought more sky than land in her world,\
but held the jewel at core: renewal\
saved best for last.

I recall the black child\
of nine or ten, a girl\
who told me with gem-clear eyes\
how her mother'd say "Always wear clean undies,\
for you never know when you might get hit by a truck."

What it amounts to is a scrupulous sense of privacy:\
There is no way---we can take in every contingency.\
We'd always keep a clean sweep of sky---in mind:\
We'd be prepared, at the same time,\
For the loss of it all---the coming clean.

Likely as we are to tread\
in the wrong places, like god's little foxes,\
at any time:\
There is no way we can meet the day with a strong enough\
sense of the holy.

### SAYRE (Woman Professor)

The men in her department envied her:\
she was too handsome, had published too many poems.\
So she'd tone down.

She wore olive-drab all that autumn,\
said she was in a dry season,\
could not write a single poem.

But her cheeks\
took on the flush\
of a woman riding.

Hand-to-hip, she'd\
breathe in the air of evening,\
the casual woman.

Sayre.\
She'd claim she was a loner,\
and had a bad spine. Who'd envy her?

So intense her fist\
would smash glass\
of a Sunday evening.

But she'd flush a whole nest of quail\
out of hiding\
without so much as a shotgun (or a sound.)

Camouflaged,\
broods of poems came.\
The poem for her was---love's occasion.

She'd rise after, with that radiance\
of a woman to meet her lover, eye shining\
face to face:

Not one of the men guessed it was another woman:\
So handsomely she moved, so darkly as through glass.
