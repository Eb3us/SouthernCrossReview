RE: [Exile's End -- a Memoir](https://southerncrossreview.org/157/exiles-end-memoir.pdf)

Thank you *very* much for your book. I am reading it and enjoying it
immensely. I love hearing about how people\'s lives intersect and one
\"finds\" Anthroposophy. This was so very thoughtful of you. Thanks
Again, *Frank Thomas Smith* for many hours of thought provoking and
interesting reads.

All the best,

Sue Mohler

RE: [The Nature Spirits](https://southerncrossreview.org/157/fts-nature-spirits.html)

I loved it. My achy 89 year old self reverted to the little girl who saw
elementals all around and had two special friends, Açidulait and
Monsieur MüllerMan.

RE: [Israel, the United States, and the Rethoric of the War on Terror](https://southerncrossreview.org/156/hilal-israel-terror.html)

Bravo Maha Hilal for exposing the mendacious rhetoric of the Zionists
and Neo--Cons both. 

It seems even more important for us to understand that together, they
executed both the 9/11 attacks and -- through a "Let it Happpen on
Purpose" -- October 7th.
