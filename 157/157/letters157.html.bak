<h1>Letters to the Editor</h1>
<p>RE: <a href="https://southerncrossreview.org/157/exiles-end-memoir.pdf">Exile’s End – a Memoir</a></p>
<p>Thank you <em>very</em> much for your book. I am reading it and
enjoying it immensely. I love hearing about how people's lives intersect
and one "finds" Anthroposophy. This was so very thoughtful of you.
Thanks Again, <em>Frank Thomas Smith</em> for many hours of thought
provoking and interesting reads.</p>
<p>All the best,</p>

<p>I loved it. My achy 89 year old self reverted to the little girl who
saw elementals all around and had two special friends, Açidulait and
Monsieur MüllerMan. </p>

<p>Bravo Maha Hilal for exposing the mendacious rhetoric of the Zionists
and Neo–Cons both. </p>
<p>It seems even more important for us to understand that together, they
executed both the 9/11 attacks and – through a “Let it Happpen on
Purpose” – October 7th. </p>

<p>I live outside Charleston. Here is a pic of a famous Oak Tree named,
"The Angel Oak" in West Ashley, Charleston County, SC.…I had a hemlock
tree where I lived in MA...as well as some other wonderful
trees...occasionally, I would hear whispers...Love the article. Tried
using the email or message tool on the website...it didn't work.…Thanks
for years of interesting reading.<br />
All the best,</p>
<p>Sue</p>
