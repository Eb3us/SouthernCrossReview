<h1>Coming Clean</h1>
<h2>by Lynn Strongin</h2>


</header>

<main style="display:flex;flex-direction:column;align-items:center">
<div>
<p class="intropoem">Georgia O’Keeffe as a child<br />
always ate round the raisin in the cookie:<br />
sought more sky than land in her world,<br />
but held the jewel at core: renewal<br />
saved best for last.</p>
<p>I recall the black child<br />
of nine or ten, a girl<br />
who told me with gem-clear eyes<br />
how her mother’d say “Always wear clean undies,<br />
for you never know when you might get hit by a truck.”</p>
<p>What it amounts to is a scrupulous sense of privacy:<br />
There is no way—we can take in every contingency.<br />
We’d always keep a clean sweep of sky—in mind:<br />
We’d be prepared, at the same time,<br />
For the loss of it all—the coming clean.</p>
<p>Likely as we are to tread<br />
in the wrong places, like god’s little foxes,<br />
at any time:<br />
There is no way we can meet the day with a strong enough<br />
sense of the holy.</p>
      </div>
<p style="text-align:center">*</p>
      <div>
<h3>SAYRE (Woman Professor)</h3>
<p class="intropoem">The men in her department envied her:<br />
she was too handsome, had published too many poems.<br />
So she’d tone down.</p>
<p>She wore olive-drab all that autumn,<br />
said she was in a dry season,<br />
could not write a single poem.</p>
<p>But her cheeks<br />
took on the flush<br />
of a woman riding.</p>
<p>Hand-to-hip, she’d<br />
breathe in the air of evening,<br />
the casual woman.</p>
<p>Sayre.<br />
She’d claim she was a loner,<br />
and had a bad spine. Who’d envy her?</p>
<p>So intense her fist<br />
would smash glass<br />
of a Sunday evening.</p>
<p>But she’d flush a whole nest of quail<br />
out of hiding<br />
without so much as a shotgun (or a sound.)</p>
<p>Camouflaged,<br />
broods of poems came.<br />
The poem for her was—love’s occasion.</p>
<p>She’d rise after, with that radiance<br />
of a woman to meet her lover, eye shining<br />
face to face:</p>
<p>Not one of the men guessed it was another woman:<br />
So handsomely she moved, so darkly as through glass.</p>
