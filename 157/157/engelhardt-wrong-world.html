<h3>A Planetary Cease Fire Is Desperately Needed</h3>
<h2>By <a href="https://tomdispatch.com/authors/tomeditor/">Tom Engelhardt</a></h2>


</header>

<main>
<p class="intro">On this planet of ours, it almost doesn’t matter who’s right and
who’s wrong when it comes to our wars.</p>
<p>Actually, let me correct that thought slightly: it certainly does
matter, but what matters so much more is that we humans simply can’t
stop fighting them. That is (or at least should be) a stunning and
deeply saddening reality. What obvious lessons we seem congenitally
incapable of learning! In the previous century, after all, there were
two truly global wars, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I_casualties">World War
I</a> and <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_casualties">World War
II</a>, that were estimated to have left significantly more than 100
million military personnel and civilians dead, while decimating parts of
the planet. The second of those conflicts ended with the obliteration of
the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6th and 9th,
1945, with the loss of <a
href="https://thebulletin.org/2020/08/counting-the-dead-at-hiroshima-and-nagasaki/">possibly
200,000 dead</a>, and the arrival in our world of a shattering new
weapon, the atomic bomb. After so many centuries of endless warfare, it
finally brought humanity to the edge of future annihilation.</p>
<p><span id="anchor"></span>And since those fateful August days so long
ago, ever more nations — with the addition of North Korea <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction">early
in this century</a>, the number has risen to <a
href="https://www.icanw.org/nuclear_arsenals">nine</a> — have acquired
nuclear weapons, while the nations that had them only continue to
“improve” and expand their arsenals. My own country, in fact, is
planning to spend something like <a
href="https://armscontrolcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/U.S.-Nuclear-Weapons-Modernization-Costs-Constraints-Fact-Sheet-v-May-2023.pdf">$1.5
trillion</a><strong> </strong>(yes, trillion!) “modernizing” its already
vast arsenal of nukes deliverable from the land, the sea, or the air,
and undoubtedly, in the years to come, from <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/21/world/europe/us-russia-nuclear-weapon-space.html">space</a>.
Russia is doing the same and the Chinese are <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/19/us/politics/china-nuclear-weapons-russia-arms-treaties.html">hustling</a>
to “catch up” in their ability to take down this planet in a big-time
fashion.</p>
<p>It is — or at least should be — incredible to think that today, 78
years after the first test atomic bomb was exploded in New Mexico, even
a relatively modest nuclear war between two countries like India and
Pakistan (as opposed to powers like the United States and Russia with
monster nuclear arsenals) could induce a <a
href="https://www.rutgers.edu/news/nuclear-war-would-cause-global-famine-and-kill-billions-rutgers-led-study-finds">global
nuclear winter</a> that would be likely to starve to death most of
humanity. Worse yet, at this point, that’s undoubtedly not even the
worst nuclear scenario imaginable.</p>
<p><strong>The Most Remarkable Accomplishment</strong></p>
<p>Not so very many years ago, in the period after the Cold War
officially ended in 1991 with the collapse of the Soviet Union, I would
have found it strange to be writing a piece about nuclear weapons. I
mean, yes, they were still obviously around in Russia, and in the U.S.
But after the Cuban missile crisis of 1962, those two powers had at
least started signing nuclear pacts, including the <a
href="https://www.cfr.org/timeline/us-russia-nuclear-arms-control">START
agreement</a> in 1991 to reduce the American and Soviet nuclear arsenals
significantly. And that seemed so hopeful then.</p>
<p>Given who we are, I’ve always found it somewhat miraculous that,
since those atomic bombs were dropped on two Japanese cities, even as
nuclear weapons spread and grew ever more powerful, another never was
used (unless you count the above-ground nuclear tests of the 1950s that
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daigo_Fukuryū_Maru">did indeed
harm</a> small numbers of human beings). Now, however, the great powers
on the planet are once again in a global nuclear arms race; key arms
treaties have been left in the dust of history; rumors are <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/21/world/europe/us-russia-nuclear-weapon-space.html">rife</a>
about such weaponry spreading into space; and two nuclear powers —
Russia and Israel — are at war at this very moment (even if not with
each other). The Russian leadership has indeed <a
href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/31/europe/medvedev-russia-nuclear-weapons-intl-hnk/index.html">threatened
to use</a> what are now called “tactical” nuclear weapons in its
conflict with Ukraine, though most of them are significantly more
powerful than the bombs that took out Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Only
recently, in fact, Russian President Vladimir Putin similarly <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/29/world/europe/putin-speech-ukraine-nuclear-conflict.html">threatened</a>
to use nuclear weaponry against European countries and the possible
“destruction of civilization.”</p>
<p>And yes, a mildly antinuclear movie, a biopic of Robert Oppenheimer,
the man who first developed such weaponry, did come out in this country
and was a <a
href="https://variety.com/2023/film/news/oppenheimer-billion-dollar-box-office-christopher-nolan-1235735537/">massive
hit</a> (right up there with a nuclear movie of another sort,
<em>Barbie</em>). In a sense, someday, if there are any of us left to
look back on this past we’re now living through, the greatest
“achievement” of humanity might be viewed as our ever more stunning
ability to nuke ourselves and everything else in sight, the works, the
whole shebang. Honestly, that might be the most remarkable
accomplishment of our species, if, of course, we don’t use them
again.</p>
<p>Oh, wait, I almost forgot! In our strange brilliance, we humans came
up with not one but two ways to utterly devastate humanity and the
planet we live on. While the first, atomic weaponry, remains an ongoing
threat of instantaneous destruction and horror, the second, a
slow-motion version of ultimate destruction, the literal broiling of
this planet over decades rather than minutes or hours, was launched <a
href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/scientists-clarify-starting-point-for-human-caused-climate-change/">almost
two centuries ago</a>. It was then that we humans began burning fossil
fuels — coal, oil, and later natural gas — to power our
industrialization and then our world. Today, the heating of this planet
continues to accelerate day by day, month by month, year by year, decade
by decade. <a
href="https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2024/01/2023-was-earths-hottest-year-on-record/">Heat
records</a> of a surprising sort are now regularly being set locally and
globally, while <a
href="https://www.edf.org/climate/how-climate-change-makes-hurricanes-more-destructive">storms</a>
are becoming more devastating, <a
href="https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2023/05/climate-change-and-droughts-whats-the-connection/">droughts</a>
ever more “mega,” and <a
href="https://www.npr.org/2023/08/22/1195154996/some-of-canadas-wildfires-likely-made-worse-by-human-driven-climate-change">forest
fires</a> fiercer, longer-lived, and more destructive.</p>
<p>And remind me, what have we learned from such a world? Well, the
United States certainly learned that it needed a military beyond compare
and began pouring what would, in the end, be untold trillions of dollars
into it. (As of 2023, our yearly “defense” spending would add up to <a
href="https://www.pgpf.org/chart-archive/0053_defense-comparison">more
than</a> that of the next 10 countries combined.) Between the end of
World War II and this moment, my country would also fight wars in Korea,
Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Grenada, Panama, Afghanistan, Iraq (twice), and
on a smaller (or do I mean larger?) scale its so-called war on terror
stretching from Pakistan across South Asia to the Middle East (where
only lately the Biden administration has been launching <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/04/world/middleeast/us-strikes-yemen-syria-iraq.html">multiple
air strikes</a> in Iraq, Syria, and Yemen), and <a
href="https://tomdispatch.com/the-pentagon-proclaims-failure-in-its-war-on-terror-in-africa/">deep
into Africa</a>. Today, in the wake of all that and having assumedly
learned something from more than a century of war-making, death, and
destruction (and since the end of World War II, not a significant
victory anywhere on the planet), my country has — yep, you guessed it! —
been <a
href="https://tomdispatch.com/the-military-industrial-complex-is-the-winner-not-you/">upping</a>
its “defense” budget in a big-time fashion, heading for the
trillion-dollar mark annually.</p>

<p>It all makes perfect sense, right?</p>
<p>Meanwhile, having discovered that nukes were capable of obliterating
life as we knew it on Planet Earth, we also came to realize that, by
mining for, drilling for, producing, and then burning fossil fuels —
coal, oil, and natural gas — in a distinctly unprecedented fashion, we
were, in fact, engaging in a war not <em>on</em>, but <em>of </em>terror
against this planet and every living thing, us included. The casualties
from climate change (and it is indeed changing this planet in an all too
disastrous fashion) are growing more numerous, as are the <a
href="https://tomdispatch.com/nowhere-to-run/">refugees</a> from places
that are already becoming too uncomfortably hot to handle. And yet, with
that now common knowledge and the last 10 months — <a
href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/2023-broke-temperature-records-will-2024-be-even-more-extreme-180983572/">month
by sweltering month</a><strong> —</strong> of record heat globally, the
<a
href="https://time.com/6692678/january-2024-hottest-record-global-warming/">hottest
months</a>, one after another, in human history, a leading candidate for
president of the United States is running on a platform of, as he puts
it, “<a
href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-says-wont-dictator-elected-day-one-rcna128267">drill,
drill, drill</a>,” ensuring that, should he win, the country that’s
already the <a
href="https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/how-us-oil-and-gas-industry-works">largest
producer</a> of oil and natural gas on Planet Earth will be leading us
all ever more directly into hell in a proverbial handbasket.</p>
<p><strong>A Planetary War of Terror</strong></p>
<p>Mind you, given that, in some fashion, we’re all involved in what can
only be thought of as a war of terror aimed at this planet, it’s not
just the Trumpists who are all too ready to ignore the reality of what
we’re actually doing in the twenty-first century. After all, with the
planet on edge and war itself an <a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/09/emissions-gaza-israel-hamas-war-climate-change">all-too-obvious
contributor</a> to global warming, Russia, Ukraine, Hamas, and Israel
are all now engaged in conflicts without any obvious end in sight that
won’t just ensure the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of people but
help heat the Earth to the boiling point. And let me add that my own
president, Joe Biden, has put significant energy into feeding the Gazan
war (including hundreds of millions of dollars of <a
href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-arms-transfer-congressional-oversight-biden-4de7597913abe75429f9ef48ace9bd88">arms
shipments</a> to Israel), no matter that doing so might <a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/feb/25/michigan-gretchen-whitmer-biden-israel-gaza-war">help
turn</a> our part of the planet over to President Drill, Drill,
Drill!</p>
<p>And lest I sell humanity short by focusing too much on my own
country, let’s not forget the <a
href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/global/10-conflicts-watch-2024">devastating
internal conflicts</a> in lands ranging from Pakistan to Sudan to
Ethiopia, where yet more of us are being slaughtered every day. And who
knows where war will break out next? <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Guyana–Venezuela_crisis">Venezuela
and Guyana</a>? North and South Korea (after all, the leader of North
Korea only recently <a
href="https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-kim-nuclear-missile-icbm-4b5cd2492261ce94dab0f5df1187caec">threatened
the South</a> with an atomic fate)? Or perhaps the <a
href="https://tomdispatch.com/the-south-china-seas-resource-wars/">South
China Sea</a> or Taiwan? The Biden administration, for instance, only
recently <a
href="https://responsiblestatecraft.org/us-aircraft-carrier-pacific/">deployed
five</a> of this country’s 11 aircraft carriers to the Pacific in a
clear challenge to China, just in case major wars in Europe and the
Middle East weren’t enough for us. No one knows, but given our history,
one thing seems painfully certain — war will undoubtedly break out again
and again and again.</p>
<p>And of course, war can now erupt in new ways, not just the
old-fashioned ones. After all, though it’s never thought of in this
fashion, the United States is indeed at war right now. And no, I’m not
thinking about the vast quantities of weaponry that we’re delivering to
Israel (or <a
href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-pushes-republicans-ukraine-israel-aid-bill-trump-opposes-2024-02-14/">not
at the moment</a> delivering to Ukraine). I’m thinking instead about the
fact that my country produced <a
href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/how-u-s-oil-production-reached-an-all-time-high-in-2023">record
levels</a> of oil in 2023 and has become the <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/02/03/climate/us-lng-natural-gas-leader.html">world’s
largest supplier</a> of natural gas (and, mind you, that’s with a
president who has <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/27/climate/biden-climate-campaign.html">taken
crucial steps</a> to whittle down our use of such fuels).</p>
<p>And yes, significant moves are being made in Europe and elsewhere
(though not in major fossil-fuel producer Russia) to repower humanity in
a fashion that will indeed cut fossil-fuel use in a major way, but it’s
simply not enough. China, for instance, is <a
href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/china-dominates-renewable-energy-coal-power-forecasts-russell-2024-01-11/">moving
faster</a> than any other country when it comes to installing renewable
energy and so changing its energy landscape. Unfortunately, it still
uses <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/03/business/energy-environment/china-coal-natural-gas.html">more
coal</a> and continues to build <a
href="https://www.npr.org/2023/03/02/1160441919/china-is-building-six-times-more-new-coal-plants-than-other-countries-report-fin">far
more</a> new coal power plants than all the other countries on this
planet combined. And consider it anything but strange that the major
private fossil-fuel companies are <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/02/business/oil-gas-companies-profits.html">still
making</a> absolute fortunes producing products that might as well be
slow-motion versions of atomic weaponry and, unbelievably enough, some
of them are still expanding their search for more of the same.</p>
<p>So, both apocalyptic war and war on the planet itself are now, sadly
enough, ever more deeply woven into the human constellation. Meanwhile,
it seems all too obvious that we can’t stop fighting older-style wars
either, killing staggering numbers of people, destroying lands, and
devastating parts of this world and those living on it.</p>
<p>Isn’t it strange that, after all these millennia, we humans just keep
on keeping on, that we can’t seem to truly face, no less truly deal
with, who and what we are and what we repeatedly do to ourselves, not to
speak of the rest of this planet? The logic of what should be done and
how we should live with one another seems all too obvious in a world
that today finds itself entering an ever more hellish state. It’s time
not just for a “cease fire” in Gaza, but for the declaration of some
kind of planetary cease fire.</p>
<p>But can we truly imagine such a thing?  Who knows?</p>
