<main style="display:flex;flex-direction:column;align-items:center">
<div>
<p class="intropoem">The starlight's intuitions pierced the twelve,<br />
The brittle night sky sparkled like a tune<br />
Tinkled and tapped out on the xylophone.<br />
Empty and vain, a glittering dune, the moon<br />
Arose too big, and, in the mood which ruled,<br />
Seemed like a useless beauty in a pit;<br />
And then one said, after he carefully spat,<br />
"No matter what we do, he looks at it!"</p>
<p>"I cannot see a child or find a girl<br />
Beyond his smile which glows like that spring moon."<br />
--"Nothing no more the same," the second said,<br />
"Though all may be forgiven never quite healed<br />
The wound I bear as witness, standing by,<br />
No ceremony surely appropriate,<br />
Nor secret love, escape or sleep because<br />
No matter what I do, he looks at it--"</p>
<p>"Now," said the third, "no thing will be the same;<br />
I am as one who never shuts his eyes,<br />
The sea and sky no more are marvelous,<br />
I know no more true freshness or surprise!"<br />
"Now," said the fourth, "nothing will be enough,<br />
--I heard his voice accompanying all wit;<br />
No word can be unsaid, no deed withdrawn,<br />
--No matter what is said he measures it!"</p>
<p>"Vision, imagination, hope or dream,<br />
Believed, denied, the scene we wished to see?<br />
It does not matter in the least; for what<br />
Is altered, if it is not true?  That we saw<br />
Goodness as it is, <em>this</em> is the awe<br />
And the abyss which we will not forget,<br />
His story now the sky which holds all thought:<br />
No matter what I think, I think of it!"</p>
<p>"And I will never be what I once was,"<br />
Said one for long as narrow as a knife,<br />
"And we will never be what we once were;<br />
We have died once; this is a second life."<br />
"My mind is spilled in moral chaos," one<br />
Righteous as Job exclaimed; "now infinite<br />
Suspicion of my heart stems what I will<br />
--No matter what I choose, he stares at it!"</p>
<p>'I am as one native in summer places<br />
--Ten weeks' excitement paid for by the rich;<br />
Debauched by that and then all winter bored,"<br />
The sixth declared.  "His peak left us a ditch!"<br />
"He came to make this life more difficult."<br />
The seventh said, "No one will ever fit<br />
His measure's heights; all is inadequate;<br />
No matter what I do, what good is it?"</p>
<p>"He gave forgiveness to us--what a gift!"<br />
The eighth chimed in. But now we know much<br />
Must be forgiven. But if forgiven, what?<br />
The crime that was will be; and the last touch<br />
Revives the memory: what is forgiveness worth?"<br />
The ninth spoke thus: "Who now will ever sit<br />
At ease in Zion at the Easter feast?<br />
No matter what the place, he touches it!"</p>
<p>"And I will always stammer, since he spoke,"<br />
One who had been most eloquent said, stammering.<br />
"I looked too much at the sun; like too much light,<br />
So too much goodness is a boomerang,"<br />
Laughed the eleventh of the troop.  "I must<br />
Try what he tried: I saw the infinite<br />
Who walked the lake and raised the hopeless dead:<br />
No matter what the feat, he first accomplished it!"</p>
<p>So spoke the twelfth, and then the twelve in chorus:<br />
"Unspeakable unnatural goodness is<br />
Risen and shines, and never will ignore us;<br />
He glows forever in all consciousness;<br />
Forgiveness, love and hope possess the pit,<br />
And bring our endless guilt, like shadow's bars;<br />
No matter what we do he stares at it!<br />
What pity then deny? what debt defer?<br />
We know he looks at us like all the stars,<br />
And we shall never be as we once were,<br />
This life will never be as once it was."</p>
