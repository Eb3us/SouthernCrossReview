<h3>Israel’s Blowback Genocide</h3>
<h2>By <a href="https://tomdispatch.com/authors/ellencantarow/">Ellen Cantarow</a></h2>


</header>

<main>
<p class="intro">Words can’t express the horrors of Israel’s genocide in Gaza. To
actually <em>feel</em> the nightmare, you would have to be there under
the bombs, fleeing with Palestinians desperately seeking a safe place
that doesn’t exist; seeing building after building destroyed; treading
through <a
href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/latest/we-dread-nightfall-stories-gaza">blood</a>
in one of the few, only partially standing hospitals; and witnessing
children and other patients sprawled on hospital floors, <a
href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/the-children-who-lost-limbs-in-gaza">limbs
amputated</a> without anesthesia (Israel having <a
href="https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/israel-blocks-entry-food-and-aid-supplies-kills-starving-civilians-attempt-forcibly-displace-palestinians-northern-gaza-enar">blocked</a>
all medical supplies).</p>
<p>It has taken the Jewish state’s savagery to break decades of silence
about its history of <a
href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2021/04/27/threshold-crossed/israeli-authorities-and-crimes-apartheid-and-persecution">crimes
against humanity</a>. U.S. military historian Robert Pape <a
href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-gaza-bombs-destruction-death-toll-scope-419488c511f83c85baea22458472a796?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=em">has
called</a> the onslaught against Gaza “one of the most intense civilian
punishment campaigns in history.” Former U.N. Assistant
Secretary-General for Human Rights Andrew Gilmour <a
href="https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20240221-un-official-deems-kill-rates-in-gaza-highest-in-the-world-since-rwandan-genocide/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">has
said</a> that we are witnessing “probably the highest kill rate of any
military… since the Rwandan genocide of 1994.”</p>
<p><strong>An Unsent Letter</strong></p>
<p>Palestine is finally an international cause. Outrage surges via
global demonstrations. Israel has become a pariah in the <a
href="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/opinionista/2024-03-19-israel-is-heading-for-full-pariah-status-after-falling-into-the-hamas-trap/">global
South</a>. In the United States, organizations including A Jewish Voice
for Peace, Code Pink, and the U.S. Campaign for Palestinian Rights have
been marching against the horrors now underway.</p>
<p>Within this charged atmosphere, the 66th reunion of my 1958
Philadelphia High School for Girls graduating class will take place in
June 2024. Girls’ High was that city’s leading academic public high
school of my time, together with its brother school, Central High
(attended by Noam Chomsky). It was stellar not only for its academic
excellence but for its integration of Black and White students at a time
of deep segregation elsewhere. My mother, who graduated from Girls’ High
in 1924, sent me there because of its policy of racial
inclusiveness.</p>
<p>I recently began preparing an open letter to my classmates about the
genocide in Gaza and the ongoing settler pogroms of ethnic cleansing on
the West Bank — houses burned, <a
href="https://tomdispatch.com/the-killing-of-gazas-environment/">olive
trees uprooted</a>, Palestinians made to flee. Ours is the prototypical
Zionist generation and I particularly wanted to address my former
classmates, some of whom still cling stubbornly to their allegiance to
Israel. I was told, however, that there wouldn’t be time to read the
letter at our reunion which lasts just a few afternoon hours. What
follows, then, is based on the letter I was preparing to read then, had
the time been available.</p>
<p><strong>Zionism and The Six Day War</strong></p>
<p>In the early 1950s, my best childhood friend collected money to plant
trees in Israel. At one point, her synagogue, which sponsored that
project, needed “straight pins.” Somehow, I heard “shraypins” instead, a
mysterious Hebrew word my imagination concocted and that her friends
would find funny indeed. Zionism, in other words, was simply foreign to
me.</p>
<p>The first time I recall a thrill from it came right after Israel’s
triumph in the 1967 <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six-Day_War">Six Day War</a>. I was
then actively involved in the anti-Vietnam War movement on my graduate
school campus and, on a trip to Paris that year, didn’t want to identify
as American. I spoke French quite well and not being able to tell from
my slight accent that I was an American, someone asked me where I was
from.  Searching for a nationality I wouldn’t be ashamed of, I blurted
out that I was an “Israelite.”</p>
<p>“Oh, your people!” he exclaimed. “Such a small people, but such a
brave people!” For the first time, I felt deeply proud of being Jewish,
not the sort of Jew who had (to my mind) cowered in a ghettoized Europe,
but a strong, triumphant Jew with a powerful army. Soon after, my
husband told me about Israel’s history — its 1948 expulsion of 750,000
Palestinian Arabs and its exploitation of the territories it illegally
occupied after the 1967 war. Not long after that, I read Noam Chomsky’s
first book about Israeli settler-colonialism, <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/039471248X/ref=nosim/?tag=tomdispatch-20"><em>Peace
in the Middle East?</em></a>, and never looked back.</p>
<p><strong>Settler Violence in the 1970s</strong></p>
<p>My husband, Louis Kampf, taught in the humanities department of
M.I.T. Chomsky was a colleague and became a good friend. It was under
his influence that, in 1979, I first went to Israel and visited the
occupied West Bank. I had an assignment to write about Israeli women — I
was then a feminist columnist for Cambridge’s <em>The Real Paper</em> —
and also agreed to do pieces for New York’s <em>The Village Voice</em>
and <em>Liberation Magazine</em>. For the <em>Voice</em> I wrote about
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moshe_Levinger">Gush Emunim</a> —
the Bloc of the Faithful, the ancestor of the Jewish settlers’ movement.
For <em>Liberation</em>, <a
href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2538371">I wrote</a> about a
Palestinian village, Halhul, two of whose teenagers were murdered by
Israeli settlers from nearby Kiryat Arba.</p>
<p>I stayed in Kiryat Arba, thanks to a distant cousin of my husband’s
who got me there in an undercover fashion. One of my interviewees
assured me that she believed in “a great chain of being,” Jews on top,
all other humans below, with Arabs at the very bottom, just before
animals, vegetables, and minerals. Her husband referred to the Talmudic
injunction to “rise and kill first.” Another settler assured me that the
Arabs could stay on the West Bank only if they would “bow their
heads.”</p>
<p>Muhammad Milhem, Halhul’s mayor, led me to the highest hill in his
village and, pointing toward Kiryat Arba, said, “This is a cancer in our
midst.” I wonder if he realized how tragically prophetic his words would
prove to be.</p>
<p><strong>Genocide in the 2020s</strong></p>
<p>Since October 8th, I’ve been riveted by the genocide in Gaza being
perpetrated by the Israeli military, which had prepared for it in a
retrospectively unsettling fashion by decades of dehumanizing
Palestinians. Hamas clearly committed war crimes on October 7th, but
international rules still govern war. A nation’s reprisal for acts
against its population must still be <a
href="https://www.diakonia.se/ihl/resources/international-humanitarian-law/ihl-principle-proportionality/">proportional</a>
to the original crime, which Israel’s war on Gaza isn’t — not faintly!
Instead, it’s been distinctly <a
href="https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/documents/atrocity-crimes/Doc.1_Convention%20on%20the%20Prevention%20and%20Punishment%20of%20the%20Crime%20of%20Genocide.pdf">genocidal</a>.
On March 28th, Reuters <a
href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/32552-palestinians-killed-gaza-since-oct-7-health-ministry-says-2024-03-28/#:~:text=DUBAI%2C_March_28_(Reuters),health_ministry_said_on_Thursday">reported</a>
that, according to Gaza’s health ministry, at least 32,552 Palestinians
had been killed and 74,980 injured in Israel’s post-October 7th military
offensive in the Gaza Strip, while more than 7,000 Gazans are missing,
many likely buried under the rubble.</p>
<p>Israel has cut off most food and water to the region. A March 18th <a
href="https://www.oxfam.org/en/press-releases/gaza-hunger-figures-worst-record-says-oxfam">Oxfam
press release</a> announced that Gaza hunger figures are the “worst on
record.” The World Health Organization (WHO) <a
href="https://www.who.int/news/item/18-03-2024-famine-in-gaza-is-imminent--with-immediate-and-long-term-health-consequences">reports</a>
that famine, a rare and catastrophic circumstance, is imminent. Usually
caused by extreme natural events, the famine in Gaza is wholly
human-made. Famine leaves the body prone to all sorts of horrendous
diseases. <a
href="https://www.who.int/news/item/21-12-2023-lethal-combination-of-hunger-and-disease-to-lead-to-more-deaths-in-gaza">According
to the WHO</a>, “[I]llness may ultimately kill more people than Israel’s
offensive. Infectious diseases are ‘soaring,’ particularly among
children with 100,000 reported cases of diarrhea, 25 times higher than
before Israel’s assaults.”</p>
<p>Were I able to show my classmates scenes from the hell that is now
the Gaza Strip, where would I begin? Would it be <a
href="https://theintercept.com/2024/03/23/intercepted-doctor-gaza-interview/#:~:text=in_Khan_Younis.-,Dr.,the_war_began_last_October">the
infant</a> whose face was partially blown off by an Israeli strike?
Would it be the 12 year old with burns over 70% of his body? Would it be
the countless <a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/02/gaza-palestinian-children-killed-idf-israel-war">unarmed
civilians</a>, including children, shot in the head and upper body with
murderous intent? Would it be <a
href="https://www.npr.org/2023/12/26/1221743518/an-aid-worker-describes-the-unbearable-suffering-of-wounded-children-in-gaza">a
baby</a> with both legs amputated, who will never learn to walk?</p>
<p>Dr. Yasser Khan, an ophthalmologist specializing in eyelid and facial
plastic and reconstructive surgery, spent 10 days in Gaza and, in <a
href="https://theintercept.com/2024/03/23/intercepted-doctor-gaza-interview/#:~:text=in_Khan_Younis.">an
interview</a> with a reporter from the <em>Intercept</em>, described
what he had seen in the European Gaza Hospital, now barely functioning,
where 35,000 people were reportedly sheltering. People were cooking in
the hallways of a building in which no sterile environment was possible
because there was nothing with which to sterilize. The medical workers
were still often performing 14 or 15 amputations on children daily. Khan
saw patients like an eight-year-old girl, rescued from the rubble with a
fractured leg, all of whose family — mother, father, aunts, uncles — was
wiped out. And there are thousands more like her, suffering from trauma
that coming generations will undoubtedly inherit. They have given rise
to a new acronym: <a
href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/02/29/gaza-children-wcnsf-orphans/">WCNSF,
or Wounded Child No Surviving Family</a>. Khan removed the eyes of
patients whose faces had been damaged by shrapnel, leaving an appearance
he dubbed “shrapnel face.”</p>
<p><strong>Aid Workers Targeted</strong></p>
<p>I would have wanted to remind my classmates that Israel has
frequently targeted aid workers, killing <a
href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2024/04/world-central-kitchen-workers-killed-israel-gaza-idf-jose-andres.html">seven
World Central Kitchen (WCK) employees</a> in early April. The Israelis
claimed that it was an accident and <a
href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/live-blog/israel-hamas-war-live-updates-rcna146529">fired</a>
the officers it held responsible. But chef Jose Andres, WCK founder,
insisted the attack was purposeful, that Israel had targeted the aid
convoy “car by car.”  </p>
<p>“This was not just a bad luck situation where ‘oops’ we dropped the
bomb in the wrong place,” <a
href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/chef-jose-andres-says-israel-targeted-his-aid-workers-systematically-car-by-car-2024-04-03/">Andres
said</a>. “This was over 1.5, 1.8 kilometers, with a very defined
humanitarian convoy that had signs in the top, in the roof, a very
colorful logo that we are obviously very proud of. It’s very clear who
we are and what we do.”</p>
<p>“WCK is not just any relief organization,” <a
href="https://www.thenation.com/article/world/world-central-kitchen-al-shifa-hospital-israel-gaza/">wrote</a>
Jack Mirkinson in <em>The</em> <em>Nation</em> magazine. “Andrés is a
global celebrity with ties to the international political establishment.
WCK had been <a
href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/since-october-7-world-central-kitchen-has-served-millions-of-meals-in-israel-and-gaza/">working
closely</a> with the Israeli government both in Gaza and in Israel
proper. It would be difficult to think of a more mainstream,
well-connected group.” It was as if Israel were showing off, Mirkinson
added, “flaunting its ability to cross every known line of international
humanitarian law and get away with it.”</p>
<p><strong>International Court of Justice Ruling</strong></p>
<p>The International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled on January 26th that
Israel’s slaughter in Gaza is a plausible case of genocide and
additional testimony from Francesca Albanese, the U.N.’s Special
Rapporteur on Palestine, “<a
href="https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/anatomy-genocide-report-special-rapporteur-situation-human-rights-palestinian-territories-occupied-1967-francesca-albanese-ahrc5573-advance-unedited-version">Anatomy
of a Genocide</a>,” only emphasized that point, given how little is left
but rubble in so much of Gaza. The majority of its homes no longer
exist, nor do its schools, universities, libraries, or music
conservatories.</p>
<p>Violating the <a
href="https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/en/ihl-treaties/gciv-1949/article-18#:~:text=and_sick_III.-,Protection_of_hospitals,the_Parties_to_the_conflict.">49th
Geneva Convention</a>, Israel has fired on ambulances and <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_health_workers_in_the_Israel–Hamas_war#:~:text=More_than_685_health_workers,by_Israeli_forces_against_Palestinians">killed</a>
more than 685 health workers, while wounding about 900 of them. It <a
href="https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/destruction-shifa-hospital-latest-evidence-israels-systematic-dismantling-gazas-health-system#:~:text=After_a_two-week-long,and_completely_out_of_service">has
destroyed</a> all but a few of Gaza’s 36 formerly flourishing hospitals,
claiming that Hamas fighters are hiding in tunnels under the buildings.
Against the civilian population Israel has used weapons like <a
href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/white-phosphorus#:~:text=Once_ignited%2C_white_phosphorus_is,of_phosphoric_acids_and_phosphine">white
phosphorous</a>, which burns to the bone and cannot be easily
extinguished. In the past, the Israeli military has been known for using
Gaza as a laboratory for <a
href="https://pulitzercenter.org/stories/cruel-experiments-israels-arms-industry">weapons
experiments</a> and the same is true of the current <a
href="https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/11/17/israels-weapons-industry-is-the-gaza-war-its-latest-test-lab#:~:text=Weapons_tested_in_each_war,laboratory_for_its_arms_industry">round
of fighting</a>.</p>
<p>Israel’s “war” against Gaza did not, of course, start on October 7th.
In 2006, after Gazans elected Hamas to govern them, Israel imposed a
siege on the Strip. As lawyer Dov Weisglass, then an aide to the prime
minister, said at the time, he wanted to keep Gazans <a
href="https://electronicintifada.net/content/israels-starvation-diet-gaza/11810">just
below starvation level</a> — not enough to kill them, but not enough to
fill them either. The present siege has turned Gaza into what’s been
called the largest open-air prison on earth, a virtual concentration
camp. <a
href="https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v27/n21/sara-roy/a-dubai-on-the-mediterranean">A
U.N. commentator</a> <a
href="https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v27/n21/sara-roy/a-dubai-on-the-mediterranean">described
this</a> as “possibly the most rigorous form of international sanctions
imposed in modern times.” Such conditions helped produce the October
attack.</p>
<p>Occupying the West Bank since 1967, Israel has distinctly contravened
international law. <a
href="https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/en/ihl-treaties/gciv-1949/article-49">Article
49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention</a> stipulates that “the Occupying
Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population
into the territory it occupies.” It also prohibits “individual or mass
forcible transfers, as well as deportations of protected persons from
occupied territory.” Israel, however, has settled about 700,000 Israeli
Jews in the West Bank. Once upon a time, there was indeed room for a
separate Palestinian state. <a
href="https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/israel-middle-east/articles/sorry-there-is-no-two-state-solution">No
more</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Arabs to the Gas Chambers</strong></p>
<p>When I visited the West Bank city of Hebron in the 1980s, I saw
graffiti on walls that proclaimed: “ARABS TO THE GAS CHAMBERS.” Back
then, the renowned Israeli public intellectual <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeshayahu_Leibowitz#:~:text=Leibowitz_was_an_Orthodox_Jew,or_the_world_to_come.">Yeshayahu
Leibowitz</a> warned that Israel was turning its soldiers into
Judeonazis. Recent YouTube videos of soldiers <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRptiehg_Jo">mocking their
victims</a> bear out his prophecy. Fascism is now pervasive in Israel.
There are courageous exceptions like journalists Amira Hass and Gideon
Levy who write for the newspaper <em>Haaretz</em> and the group <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/10/world/middleeast/israelis-palestinians-peace-activists.html">Combatants
for Peace</a>. But <a
href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2024-01-24/ty-article/.premium/dont-ask-israelis-right-now-about-palestinian-casualties-in-gaza/0000018d-3770-d32b-adcf-f77227570000">all
too many</a> Israelis have supported their country’s assault on Gaza, or
even wanted something worse. I wish I could have told my classmates
that, should they care about Israel, it’s their responsibility to speak
out now.</p>
<p>The genocide in Gaza has been enabled, of course, by President Biden,
who <a
href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/04/04/world-central-kitchen-us-weapons-israel/">continues
to send</a> billions of dollars’ worth of weaponry, including <a
href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/03/29/us-weapons-israel-gaza-war/">devastating
2,000-pound bombs</a>, to Israel. Without those arms, the government of
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu couldn’t be acting as it is. While it
purports to be searching for and killing Hamas perpetrators of the
October 7th atrocities, it’s actually gone to war against the entire
population of Gaza. Israeli historian <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwx1KhYvTg0">Ilan Pappe</a> <a
href="https://www.democracynow.org/2023/10/31/ilan_pappe_israel_invades_gaza">sees
it</a> as “a massive operation of killing, of ethnic cleansing of
depopulation.”</p>
<p>When Jews were being slaughtered by the Nazis, the world turned away.
Now, the world has awakened to Israel’s crimes. Many American Jews, like
those in <a href="https://www.jewishvoiceforpeace.org/">A Jewish Voice
for Peace</a> (whose demonstrations I’ve attended) are indeed speaking
out.</p>
<p>It’s often asked how a people who suffered so much could cause such
suffering. In fact, almost all the survivors of the Holocaust are dead.
Obviously, none of the perpetrators of the genocide in Gaza and the
ethnic cleansing of the West Bank were in European concentration camps.
In a 1979 interview, renowned Israeli dissident, Hebrew University
chemistry professor Israel Shahak pointed out that no Holocaust survivor
had ever been a member of the Israeli government. Israel frequently uses
the Holocaust to justify its actions in the Palestinian territories.
This is a sacrilege, while one of history’s great crimes is being
committed, and this member of the class of 1958 knows it.</p>
