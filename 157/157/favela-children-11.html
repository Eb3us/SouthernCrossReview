<p><strong>Londrina, 16 January 1972</strong></p>
<p class="intro">Up and away to <em>Marumbi!</em></p>
<p>I rode the whole night in the bus. Luckily, Daiggers brought my two
impossibly large suitcases to the station. In Apucarana I made the usual
connection with the <em>Viacao</em> <em>Londrinense</em>, the Londrina
bus company, famed for its busses breaking down after a few miles, which
is exactly what happened. We all got out and sat at the side of the road
waiting for the replacement bus. We were covered with dust by the time
it arrived in a cloud of red dust an hour later. It got as far as
Faxinal before giving up the ghost.</p>
<p>Thank God I was only going that far, where a jeep was waiting to take
me and my voluminous luggage the remaining fifteen miles to Cido's adobe
hut. It flew over rocks and holes, at one point getting stuck in one,
and had to be pulled out. When I finally arrived, children and dogs came
running and jumping all over me. They were all happy that I had really
come again. I was given something to eat right away: a cucumber, saved
especially for me, rice, beans and a piece of smoked bacon. And everyone
talked, talked, talked, the children about how they had counted the days
to my arrival, how they listened to the sound of every jeep; I, about
how I had run around Sao Paulo inquiring about schools and work and how
I told everyone about their life at the <em>sitio</em> (home on the
land) and that everybody gave me things for them: dresses, shoes,
shirts, suits, school-books, notebooks, pencils, sweets and a chocolate
Santa Claus which was divided into twenty parts so all could have a
taste.</p>
<p>The overweight suitcase was suspensefully unpacked to the
accompaniment of much laughter. Ivan the Great's trousers came up to Seu
Pedro's neck. His shoes were too big of course, but they are bound to
the feet with laces and thus offer protection against snakes during
field work. The new frying pan was consecrated with pancakes filled with
strawberry jam donated by my Yugoslavian pupil.</p>
<p><strong>17 January 1972</strong></p>
<p>Rise and shine! We all creep out of our beds and gather on the bench
in front of the hearth waiting for coffee and roasted corn-cobs. First
water must be brought up from below where it trickles through the mud;
not clear spring-water, but an opaque brew, probably infected will all
kinds of viruses. Some of it is put over the fire to make coffee, the
rest is for brushing our teeth. The sun is already quite hot and no one
feels much like working, but there's no alternative: we must go out to
the fields and pick weeds. I put on a straw hat, pick up a hoe and put
long sleeves over my bare arms in order to protect my noble white skin
from the brutal Brazilian sun. A rice field that had been weeded just
two weeks ago waited with a thick new growth. Hoe, hoe, hoe -
interspersed with conversation. Cido and Zéca had participated in a
church youth meeting and were very enthusiastic. We talked about it. How
should they love their parents? How should they love their country? Hoe,
hoe, hoe! Why are you against nationalism? Hoe, hoe, hoe! Who was
Hitler? etc. etc. As the heat increases the conversation dies out. I
push my hat around hoping to lessen the impact of the heat on my head
and see only weeds before me and -- as in a dream -- a nice pitcher of
cool clear spring-water and a basket of juicy oranges. Then Maricela
appears with a pot of not exactly clear but at least thirst-quenching
water. Finally it was eleven o'clock and we shuffled back for lunch:
rice, beans, a piece of pork and a vegetable treat for <em>Ruti</em>,
(Ute) - pumpkin.</p>
<p>Another drink of water and back to work. The air shimmers with heat
and the work is hard. The damned tree-stumps are all over, charred and
full of holes and sometimes snakes. And this gently clinging grass
<em>capim colonial</em>, which only comes out after three or four blows.
When you see a mass of <em>capim</em> ahead, you feel like despairing.
Luckily Zéca comes to my aid and pulls out the more resistant
bushels.</p>
<p>In the evening I am completely exhausted and even a bath in the river
doesn't have its usual healing effect. I sit lazily at the dinner table
(how good that one can do that here) and don't have the least desire to
teach anything. But duty calls. Inexorably Evaristo makes the sign for
class: he writes with his finger on his left palm. <em>Entao vamo</em>,
let's go! We last until ten o'clock. One after the other we creep into
bed.</p>
<p><strong>18 January</strong></p>
<p>A terrible rain-storm. The kitchen swam, the earthen floor turned to
mud. In the "living-room" the rain streamed through the door and window
and washed over the bean harvest stored there. While Evaristo was busy
covering the smoke-holes on the roof with a tarpaulin, Cido was
straining heroically in a race with the rain to push out the water that
had entered through the door. The situation was serious (because of the
beans which might rot), but also fun. Protected from the dripping water
by straw hats, we all fought against the superiority of the streaming
water, wading and slipping over the gradually dissolving earth floor.
The mother, however, stood earnestly at the hearth trying to keep the
fire going despite the rain pouring on it. She called us to order,
saying that we should pray that the house isn't swept away by the storm,
something which she had already experienced. No one knew what God had in
store for us.</p>
<p>You really feel more at the mercy of nature and the elements here
than elsewhere. A sincere reverence and faith go hand in hand with
superstitious acts. For example, you shouldn't look in a mirror after
dinner because you might see yourself distorted and remain so. Or a
cigarette may not be lit from a candle.</p>
<p><strong>20 January</strong></p>
<p>Seu Manuel and family invited the neighbors to a Saint Sebastian
celebration. As every year, Cido said the rosary with everyone who came
by horse, donkey or by foot. He gave a kind of catechism class for the
children. There were at least a hundred people, but all of them got some
coffee and home-made bread. Later pigs and other presents, such as eggs,
rice, corn, etc., were sold at auction. Seu Pedro did it very well and
with humor. Then the long way home in the dark, stumbling over
tree-stumps, springing over streams. No one really wanted to be first in
this goose-march; the end of the line wasn't much loved either. Ghost
stories were told. The forest over there is enchanted. Zéca rode through
it once and his horse suddenly shied, listened to the forest, and wasn't
to be moved from the spot. In the still darkness, with the moonlight
stabbing out over the scudding clouds, the unexplainable noises -- it
all seemed really uncanny.</p>
<p><strong>21 January 1972</strong></p>
<p>Practiced arithmetic with Marili and Marinalva while we sorted beans,
that endless mass that is needed for a family of fourteen for lunch and
supper. Zéca rode to town, a welcome change from the boredom of weeding.
He brought a sack of wheat to be ground at the mill and he had to buy
coffee, toothpaste and sugar as well as bring a birthday card to the
post office for Papa. There he was asked to whom he is writing in
Germany, whether it's to the "good" Germany and if he has a girlfriend
there, etc.</p>
<p>In the afternoon I harvested a sack of green corn in order to make
<em>curral</em> (corn pudding). But how was I to carry the heavy sack
home? With great effort I got it onto my head where it pricked me and
almost fell over. The pressure was terrible and I ran as fast as I could
to get it over with as soon as possible. It felt as though my head was
getting flatter and my neck was being pushed into my shoulders.
Relieved, I let the sack fall at the door of the house. Then I grated
the corn-cobs for two hours, stirred the pudding for a half-hour under
clouds of steam, only to see how the magnificent result vanished in five
minutes into fourteen mouths.</p>
<p>At five o'clock Zéca returned from Faxinal, carrier of news from the
"world" and of new provisions. The children came running from the field
and gathered around the sack, from which he took coffee, sugar and a
sweet for everyone.</p>
<p>This sweet tasted better than any I have ever had.</p>
<p>After bathing I rode Gringo, the horse, to his pasture. Zéca: "Now
after riding twenty miles he should get special feed, not only this dry
grass. It makes me sad."</p>
<p>After supper we refreshed our memories of the Londrina times five
years ago. How Paulo Manteiga (Butter-Paul) climbed up the
<em>abacate</em>-tree and was attacked by African wasps; how Zéca hurt
his head diving in the swamp; how Cido washed strangers' cars in the
city, was ashamed to ask the owners for money and came home without
having earned a cent. Finally Seu Pedro came in with a whip cut from a
branch to enhance my authority as teacher. We quickly got our notebooks
out and quiet reigned over the table, broken only by the murmuring of
sums and calls for help: :"Oh, Ute, what do I do now?" Zéca had to write
a report on his first day in Marumbi -- I almost died laughing. The
evening passed quickly solving riddles and talking about ships,
airplanes, travel and the wish to travel. It went on in bed over the
separation-wicker between girls and boys "bedrooms" until the first
snores were heard.</p>
<p><strong>22 January</strong></p>
<p>Today nobody could bring themselves to go out to work. The wood was
wet so we couldn't make the fire at first. It took an eternity till the
coffee woke some will to work in us. There was no bread. I made pancakes
from flour. As I stood at the fire the rain fell on my head and a
simmering drop of oil fell on the sick chicken who was trying to dry out
on the oven.</p>
<p><strong>Sunday, 23 January 1972</strong></p>
<p>It rained till midday, perfect weather for teaching. Evaristo
struggles with division, Joaozinho learns to tell time, Cido writes a
report, Marinalva, Maristela and Marili learn to write. Zéca went to
Dedinho's to bring him the sneakers I got for him when I heard that he
doesn't go anywhere because he has no shoes. As thanks he made a pile of
drawings and wrote a poem about land-laborers and city people. He could
also be doing something other than hoe weeds (not even his own, but
those of his <em>patrao</em>). <em>Joias perdidas no mato</em>, Jewels
lost in the jungle - as the banana seller said when he passed by with
his mule. Pearls lost in the wilderness. In many of the huts are people
with "good heads" for learning who don't use them because there are no
schools.</p>
<p>In the afternoon we took advantage of the rain-freshened air for a
family outing, hopping over puddles through fields of mud. On the way
back I cautiously asked Seu Pedro if Zéca couldn't come to Sao Paulo
with me now, before the harvest, in order to register for high school.
Contradicting all Zéca's prophesies, he had no objection. When we got
back I gave Zéca an essay to write: "What would you do if your father
said you could go to Sao Paulo?" Everything which had been seething in
him bubbled out in an hour's writing. When he finished I told him that
he could go.</p>
<p><strong>24 January</strong></p>
<p>This morning the dirty drinking-water took its toll. My stomach
twitched and rumbled terribly and I couldn't even think of coffee and
beans. They gave me a horribly bitter drink and health was restored.
Conversation about <em>benzedor</em>, people who heal by means of
blessings, prayers and herb-teas followed this cure. The power of prayer
is deeply ingrained in young and old alike. At night before sleeping
they all sit on their beds and say their prayers. Through the dark huts
you hear from all sides "<em>a bencao, Mae; a bencao, pai</em>" - bless
you, mother; bless you, father. This attitude, which transmits faith
(though its sometimes mixed with superstition) to the young, is what
gives me the courage to risk life in the city -- so full of thieves and
temptations -- for Zéca and Cido. These children have substance and a
solid inner life, which they hopefully will not lose even when they
sometimes despair of the world and themselves.</p>
<p><strong>27 January</strong></p>
<p>We rose with the birds to go to Londrina. Soaking wet from the dew,
Zéca and I reached the road, on which a car might pass that would take
us to Faxinal. We had better luck than the last time, when we waited
from eleven in the morning till three in the afternoon: an open combi
picked us up very soon. We spoke about the play we intended to put on.
One day Cido had come from the fields and announced, "I made up a
story". I grabbed a pencil and paper and wrote while Cido dictated. No
sooner had we finished than Zéca said, "I have also invented a story,
and a poem." A fruitful day!</p>
<p>Cido intends to write a play about his own life: the family move from
Pernambuco in a pick-up truck filled with twenty people, some benches,
suitcases, bundles and the gas oven, which had to be unloaded four times
a day to cook coffee, rice and beans; his mother's fright as she woke
one morning to find them all white and stiff -- white from hoar-frost.
Later the wretched beginnings in Marumbi, the monotonous life on the
land with few diversions, such as the ant invasion. One morning after a
heavy rainfall the house was swarming with ants; shelves, beds, walls,
cases, there was nothing not covered with the black, excitedly crawling
beasts. When the ants weren’t gone by evening, the inhabitants turned
the house over to them and slept on mattresses and sacks in the yard
under the mamao-tree. The next day they were still the masters of the
house. The second night out of doors. On the third night they left, all
in the same direction.</p>
<p>Anyway, we rode on to Londrina in the rattling bus and considered who
would play which roles, the costumes, etc. The choice of costumes was of
course not large: the curtain, a tablecloth, Maria's wedding veil and my
dress-jacket would have to bear with it.</p>
<p>In Londrina we ran from one place to another to get Zéca's documents
in order: voting card, military service certificate and similar rubbish.
The next day we returned to Marumbi.</p>
<p><strong>29 January</strong></p>
<p>Normally my morning chore was to pick up the milk from a fazenda two
miles away. But since the milker disappeared Zéca went with me. The cows
weren't exactly gentle. First we drove one to the milking place. The
hind legs had to be tied together with its tail a good trick with the
hind legs continuously kicking out. I held the calf that was struggling
for milk away on a rope while Zéca pulled rapidly on the udders until a
thin flow of milk streamed into the pail. The cow began to kick again
and I, in fright, let the calf go, which greedily began to suck. The cow
ran away with the calf after it, still sucking. Zéca and I ran after
them and the whole procedure started again. When a quart of milk had
been accumulated she deigned to let go with dung. The meager final
result was a quart of milk and pants full of liquid cow-shit. I couldn't
stop laughing. How easy it is in the city where you only have to go to
the super-market!</p>
<p>Today I stuffed myself with corn. Breakfast consisted of
<em>curral</em> (corn pudding), lunch <em>pamonha</em> (boiled corn
wrapped in corn-husks) and in the evening one roasted corn-cob after the
other. I feel like a corn depot. We spoke about war and the beginning of
industry in Brazil. Seu Pedro told how the first automobile was received
with fear and cries of joy in Batateira, his hometown, and how the
unaccustomed honking accelerated his grandfather's death. The first
airplane was seen as a flying monster. When Seu Pedro rode on the train
he was celebrated as a hero in his town. And now, at least in the big
cities, you can hardly escape with your life from the enormous amount of
cars.</p>
<p><strong>Sunday, 30 January</strong></p>
<p>On the daily milk-march with Zéca through corn as high as a man's eye
and tangled underbrush, I learned a lot about Brazil. He told me about
flying snakes that used to exist in Perenambuco, and about the
seven-headed monster in Juazeiro (North-Brazil) which was rendered
harmless about fifty years ago by a priest's prayers. We also spoke of
the wage earners in this area, their fear of the fazendeiros and their
complete subordination. We arrived at the fazenda and fought with the
cow, but with more success this time: two quarts.</p>
<p>During the afternoon I went to Arlindo's under a fiercely glowing sun
to give him his part in the play. He's another boy who can only put his
strength and reason into planting bananas. I had enough sun for one day.
During the day it cooks your brains; in the evening it blinds you.</p>
<p><strong>31 January</strong></p>
<p>I was a bit weak today and couldn't bring myself to go out to the
fields or teach the children. Probably it's the result of yesterday's
over-exposure to the sun. It was evening before I recovered. At night we
observed the stars, which you can see so clearly here compared to the
city. They once saw a glowing sphere cross the sky; what could it have
been? The mother told me in detail about their dog, who survived all
their journeys to Sao Paulo and Pernambuco, only to die of a snake-bite
here. The goat, which was to have given milk as antidote, fell over in
the dog's presence and died soon after. So strong is the power of snake
poison, said Dona Maria.</p>
<p><strong>1 February</strong></p>
<p>Hot, hot, hot! The children are working in the jungle clearing a
piece of land with bush-knives in order to plant beans there. You trudge
into an opaque mass of branches, felled trees, ferns and prickly
undergrowth and chop your way further into the <em>mato</em>. Later it
is all burned and the planting is done on the ashes between burnt out
tree-stumps. Zéca killed a <em>cascavel</em> (rattle-snake) with a brood
of fifteen. Now I walk through chopped-down undergrowth with mixed
feelings to bring the children the longed-for water jug. I have already
fallen several times into strange holes in which snake families could
still be living.</p>
<p>Today Dona maria told me how Evaristo came home one day from the
<em>roca</em>, fell exhausted to the floor in the shade and said that he
could hardly see anything. The <em>benzedor</em> was called. Prayers,
faith in God and <em>Nossa Senhora da Aparecida</em> (Mary) and garlic
compresses on the head and wrists did the job after three days. The boy
looks so strong despite being full of parasites and viruses.</p>
<p><strong>2 February</strong></p>
<p>For unknown reasons everyone was nervous today. Everything went
wrong. The milk wasn't picked up, land wasn't cleared because of
yesterday's rain storm; There were only beans and maniaca-meal for lunch
because there was no rice left. Afterwards we all had stomach pains and
had to drink the horrible tasting bitter herb-tea. The lessons didn't go
well either. The two youngest children, Rubens and Marcia, cried and
were finally brought to the benzador. The only decent thing we did was
to make props for the play: crowns, hats, knives for the guards, etc.
Things picked up around evening. Mario and the other Ukrainians came,
later Dedinho and Odair, for rehearsal. At last we became the usual
merry company. After rehearsal we played. Young and old jumped on each
others back and laughed like crazy.</p>
<p><strong>3 February</strong></p>
<p>Rubens still had stomach pains, so I brought him to Odair's
grandmother to be blessed. What an animal-friendly house! Pig in, goat
out, among the usual plucked hens, shaggy dogs and cats, as well as
geese, mosquitoes, stinging fly, etc.etc. I sat eating my corn-cake
surrounded by two dogs and countless hens who counted the bites. Finally
a hen jumped up onto the cake and took her portion.</p>
<p><strong>5 February</strong></p>
<p>As today is Saturday as well as the day of the theatre performance
and farewell party, the children stopped working at twelve o'clock. In
the afternoon we made the stage out of bamboo with a straw roof.
Joaozinho was sent to borrow a large petroleum lamp -- a two-hour walk.
Cido got a threshing tarpaulin from the next hut to use as the curtain
and Cido saddled the horse to distribute the last invitations over the
mountain. He returned from this expedition at nine o'clock at night when
the house and yard were already bursting full of expectant guests. The
concept of time must still be developed, otherwise things won't work out
very well in the industrial age in Sao Paulo. Cido was nervous and
angry, yelled at Zéca, who, offended, refused to act, and it took all my
powers of persuasion to appease their wounded honor.</p>
<p>After this behind-the-scenes skirmish, the play finally began and
they were all better than ever, improvising, introducing new jokes; even
the dog took part in the hunting scene. The smiling faces of the
audience were visible in the dim light of the kerosene lamp. My
temperamental revolt against the king's injustice, the battle with
swords in the palace, the ending, when King Zéca proclaimed that now the
poor as well as the rich would be happy, were all a great success.</p>
<p>After the theatre we danced until four in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>6 February</strong></p>
<p>Zéca packed his two pairs of pants, two shirts, toothbrush and towel.
After yesterday's gaiety, the atmosphere is tense today. Departure time
is near.</p>
<p><strong>7 February</strong></p>
<p>Tears, sobbing, wailing: Zéca is going with me to Sao Paulo. Nothing
and nobody can hold him back. As we walked along the road with our
suitcases he proudly told me of his plans for the future. "I'll show
everyone that you can become something even though you're poor." Mario,
the Ukrainian, rode after us to ask us to find his brother in Sao
Paulo.</p>
<p><strong>February 1972</strong></p>
<p>I've been back from Marumbi for several days. Six weeks at the end of
the world, far from the smog of Sao Paulo but also far from any chance
to study. Nervously I prepare the zoology course for my fourth grade
children and try to readjust myself to blonde hair and blue eyes.</p>
<p>Zéca is now the proud owner of four documents: health, trade and
personal I.D., as well as a voting certificate. You go around here with a file
full of documents, which you can only obtain by standing on line from
four in the morning at different government offices. Today is his first
day as a construction worker. He will go to high school at night. He is
not to be envied. After a hard day's work he sits in school from eight
to eleven at night being stuffed with sterile stuff: physics without
experiments, geography without maps, etc. But for him it's the only way
to a better future. I often help him with his school work. Recently we
tried to penetrate the mysteries of the consonant B. It isn't so easy to
make a B; the school-books provide exact instructions, which poor Zéca
must memorize for the exam. Drab theory.</p>
<p><strong>Marumbi, June 1972</strong></p>
<p>Yes, I'm back in Marumbi, sitting in an adobe hut on the rice
harvest, because the peanut harvest is being shelled on the only chair.
What am I doing here in the middle of the school term? During the summer
holidays I met a girl who has suffered from asthma for twelve years. I
arranged for treatment in a Sao Paulo clinic, but she had to come
immediately. I requested a leave of absence from the Waldorf School and
traveled all night and a half a day to get here to the wilderness. It's
more or less civilized until Faxinal, but then the dirt road becomes
bumpier, ever narrower until finally it's no more than an almost
overgrown path. It must have looked strange to the occasional
<em>caboclos</em> (farmers) who rode by to see me briskly marching along
in the morning sun with a knapsack full of warm clothes on my back. And
then the surprise when I arrived, alone, and with the heavy knapsack, as
though I wasn't afraid...</p>
<p>A cup of roasted coffee tasted good. Gradually we came to the main
reason for my visit. I was prepared for the possibility that Hilda's
parents would be afraid to let her go to the big city. They have barely
emerged from the last corner of the world. But Hilda decided to go
immediately. For her anything is better than sitting here day after day
waiting for her nightly attacks. Father and mother sat across from each
other and simply couldn't decide.</p>
<p>The father said to the mother, "You decide, as far as I'm concerned
she can go."</p>
<p>The mother said to the father, "You give the orders here."</p>
<p>And so it went for hours. With the patience of an angel I listened to
it all. Hilda implored me, she even wanted to run away with me. When I
was stiff from sitting so much I went to the nearby river where Dondoca
was doing her wash. The parents were afraid that I was going away.
Result: Hilda would go with me. Tomorrow she would pick me up at Cido's,
where I was staying the night, and we would take the early bus to Sao
Paulo. I had to be back in school.</p>
<p>The next morning I waited for her and when she didn't come I left
with a lightened knapsack and mad with rage. Hilda's mother now had a
"simpatia" against asthma, a feather and a brown powder, which she had
got from the church and buried in the mud wall of her house.</p>
<p><strong>July 1972</strong></p>
<p>I'm moving again. As we must move out of the school house sometime
anyway, I looked for an apartment or a house during the holidays and
nearly fainted when I realized that the cost of renting a simple
apartment is the same or more than I earn in a month. As a last resort I
considered marrying some rich old slob. But I was saved from this fate
by a teacher whose house had been broken into and looted and who
generously offered it to me because he didn't want to set foot in it
again.</p>
<p>I decided on the spot and in three hours we packed all the books,
clothes and pictures, bought some furniture, rented a pick-up and moved
into our little house in <em>Vila das Beleza</em>. I'm ecstatic. This
part of the city isn't nearly as fine and beautiful as the surroundings
of the school (translator's note: an understatement). We have an
extensive view, not of flowers and trees, but of eroded land. From the
window you can see the Brazilian people in all their racial mixture and
not only the eternal foreigners as is the case around the school.</p>
<p><strong>End of July 1972</strong></p>
<p>Life is certainly full of variety. Yesterday I had lunch with a
German engineer at the Hilton Hotel where a waiter pushed a chair under
me and today I sit on the stoop of a favela house and warm myself in the
sun surrounded by a flock of children.</p>
<p>Zeca and I went to visit his family, who have moved back to Londrina.
The bus broke down twice and it was icy cold. The coffee plants will
surely freeze again. The knowledge that there are only two blankets for
fourteen people at Zeca's didn't exactly warm me up. Finally the bus
recovered and we arrived in Londrina around midnight. We ran to Zeca's
house and knocked on the door. Everyone was asleep. The dog recognized
us and woke up the house. Joyfully we were dragged to bed. They all
hopped about and laughed. Soon we were sleepy and warmed ourselves
according to the closer-closer principle. I was afraid I'd be assigned a
single bed and have to freeze alone in it. But thank God I slept in the
big double-bed wedged in between the children. I snuggled against
Maristela's back.</p>
<p>Zeca's sisters and brothers haven't found work in Londrina. Only Cido
works a few hours a day. We scoured the city looking for work. All for
nothing. It drives you crazy. Everyone just hangs around. Those who
can't hold out go to Sao Paulo.</p>
