<p class="intro">Nicolás and Carolina were lost in the woods and didn’t know which way
to turn. Whichever way they went they seemed to get more lost. They sat
down on the roots of a tree and Carolina began to cry. Her brother told
her not to cry, that they would find their way out eventually, but the
truth was that he felt like crying too.</p>
<p>Suddenly, they heard a faint sound of someone moaning: “Oh, oh! help
me! oh, oh!” They held their breath and waited. It happened again: “Oh,
oh!”</p>
<p>“Maybe it’s only the wind,” Nicolás said.</p>
<p>“No, it’s someone crying for help,” Carolina objected. “What should
we do?”</p>
<p>Nicolás thought for a moment. He was older so he had to make the
decisions. “Let’s go to where the sound is coming from. If it’s only the
wind we won’t find anything. If someone needs help we’ll help them if we
can.”</p>
<p>They stood up and walked towards the sound, which was repeated every
few seconds. Finally they came upon a fallen tree. A leg was sticking
out from under it. The cries for help were coming from under the tree’s
branches. They looked at each other, then back at the leg. “A child must
be under there,” Nicolás said.</p>
<p>“Don’t just stand there, get me out!” a man’s voice cried.</p>
<p>They tried to lift the tree, but it was heavy and they couldn’t hold
it up.</p>
<p>“Wait, I have an idea,” Nicolás said. There was a large, round rock
nearby, which he rolled up to the tree. “When I lift the tree you roll
the rock under it, Carolina.” He grabbed the tree-trunk with both hands
and lifted with all his strength. “Now!” he cried. Carolina was on her
knees. She pushed as hard as she could and the rock rolled under the
tree. Then Nicolás dropped it on the rock.</p>
<p>“Get me out!” the voice shouted again.</p>
<p>“Nicolás took hold of the leg and pulled. Another leg appeared which
Carolina grabbed and they dragged a strange little man from under the
tree. When he stood up and brushed himself off, they saw that he wasn’t
any taller than Nicolás. He wore a pointed green hat, green shirt and
pants, no shoes and had a white beard that reached to his waist.</p>
<p>“They ought to teach these trees better manners than to fall on a
body when he’s sleeping,” the little man growled.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t the tree’s fault,” Carolina said.</p>
<p>The little man looked surprised. “It wasn’t mine, either,” 
he said.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you going to say thank you?” Carolina asked him.</p>
<p>“Don’t be fresh, Carolina,” Nicolás told her.</p>
<p>The little man looked from one to the other and ran his fingers
through his beard. “No, Carolina is right.” He took off his hat, bowed
almost to the ground and said, “Thank you kindly.”</p>
<p><img src="bosque2.jpg" class="a" /></p>
<p>Carolina giggled. The little man straightened up, put his hat back on
and laughed heartily.</p>
<p>“Now, my lovelies, tell me what you are doing alone so deep in the
forest.”</p>
<p>“We’re lost,” Nicolás said.</p>
<p>“Lost, are we. And how did that happen?”</p>
<p>“We were going to our Aunt Nélida’s house and we were supposed to
take the train that goes around the forest,” Nicolás explained. “But we
decided to walk through it instead and we got lost.”</p>
<p>“Did you walk to save the carfare?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Are you poor?”</p>
<p>“Oh no,” Carolina said. “We live in a nice house.”</p>
<p>“We wanted to see if we could do it, too,” Nicolás added.</p>
<p>“Hmm, foolhardy, my boy, foolhardy.”</p>
<p>“Can you tell us how to get to Aunt Nélida’s?” Carolina asked.</p>
<p>The little man stroked his beard. “I think I can help you there, but
first you must promise me not to come alone so deep into the forest
again, at least not until you’re older.”</p>
<p>“Oh, we won’t,” Carolina said. “Our mamá and papá and Aunt Nélida are
going to be worried about us.”</p>
<p>He looked at Nicolás, who said, “Yes, sir.”</p>
<p>“Good. Now, I don’t know where your Aunt Nélida lives, but I have
some friends who can show you. Help me gather some kindling wood. We’ll
need a fire anyway if were going to roast the potatoes I have in my
knapsack.”</p>
<p>They gathered kindling wood and dry leaves and the little man pulled
a match the size of a pencil from his coat pocket and struck it on the
rock that was still holding up the tree. Soon a fire was crackling away.
“Now watch”. He bent down, picked up a twig that had fallen from the
kindling, and drew a figure on the ground:</p>
<p><img src="tri-down.jpg" class="a" /></p>
<p>“Are you there, Rusty?” he called. “Ah yes, there you are.”</p>
<p>“Where?” Carolina asked, looking around.</p>
<p>“Look into the fire.”</p>
<p>They looked into the fire and saw a small figure of flame smiling at
them.</p>
<p><img src="bosque4.jpg" class="a" /></p>
<p>“That’s Rusty Salamander,” the little man said. “Tell us, Rusty–
Where does Aunt Nélida live?”</p>
<p>Rusty Salamander shot out his arm, which was a tongue of flame, to
his right and nodded his head three times. Then he disappeared, or at
least they could no longer see him. Only dancing flames were visible in
the fire.</p>
<p>The little man looked in the direction Rusty Salamander had
indicated. “The south-west,” he said, “where the sun will soon be. After
we eat these potatoes you go that way. Just follow the sun and you’ll
soon reach your Aunt Nélida’s.” He poured a pile of potatoes from his
knapsack onto the ground and pushed the twig through one of them and
held it close over the fire. “Find twigs and stick them through some
potatoes. They’re delicious”.</p>
<p>The children gladly followed his instructions and they were soon
eating the roasted potatoes, which were indeed delicious.</p>
<p>“How far is it to Aunt Nélida’s?” Nicolás asked the little man.</p>
<p>“It’s not far to the end of the woods. Once you’re out of the woods
you can find it, can’t you?”</p>
<p>“Sure,” Nicolás said.</p>
<p>The little man looked at them both, one after the other, then he
smiled and the skin at the corners of his eyes crinkled. “You both look
tired. You should have a nap, but before you do I’m going to show you
the signs you can use to call my other friends in case you need
them”.</p>
<p>He squatted and scratched out three more signs next to the Rusty
Salamander sign. This is what he drew:</p>
<p><img src="bosque5.jpg" class="a" /></p>
<p>“You can use the first sign to call Nebenezar Gnome, the second is to
call Beatrix Nixie and the third is to call Sylvia Sylph,” he said,
pointing to each sign as he said the name.</p>
<p>“How will we know which one to call?” Nicolás asked.</p>
<p>“Oh, that’s easy. If you have an earth problem you call Ebenezer
Gnome, if it’s a water problem you call Beatrix Nixie and if the problem
has something to do with air, you call Sylvia Sylph. But only call if
you really need them. And you have to draw the correct sign first. Will
you remember them?”</p>
<p>Carolina, who was sitting against a tree, closed her eyes and her
head dropped onto her chest. She had fallen asleep. But Nicolás stared
at the signs and said that he would remember them.</p>
<p>“Now rest,” the little man said. “You have a long way to go and the
forest can be tricky and dangerous.” Nicolás suddenly felt very sleepy.
He lay back and fell asleep on the soft forest ground.</p>
<p>Carolina was the first to wake up. “Nicolás,” she cried, “where’s the
little man?” Nicolás sat up and rubbed his eyes and looked around. Loose
earth covered the place where the fire had been. The  signs the little
man had scratched in the ground were no longer there. “He must have
erased them”, Nicolás said.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“The signs. But never mind, let’s go.”</p>
<p>They set off following the sun in the south-west. After what seemed a
long time but wasn’t really, they heard thunder and saw a lightning bolt
in the sky. “It’s going to rain,” said Nicolás. “Look, there’s a place
we can take shelter.” Off to their right was a hill with a cave in its
base. They ran to it and scrambled inside. They huddled together and
watched the rain fall in sheets outside. Suddenly lightning struck the
hill above them and a huge rock fell across the entrance of the cave,
shutting them in. Nicolás pushed the rock but it didn’t move.</p>
<p>“What are we going to do now?” Carolina asked him.</p>
<p>Nicolás thought a moment, then took from his pocket the twig the
little man had used to scratch the signs in the ground and drew one of
them on the floor of the cave:</p>
<p><img src="tri-2.gif" style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:4em"  /></p>
<p>“Ebenezer Gnome, please come and help us.” They waited. At first
nothing happened, then they heard a noise behind them. They turned
around and saw a boy dressed all in brown, who was about as high as
Nicolás’s knees. He walked between them, kicked the rock and it fell
away as though it were a pebble. Then he walked back into the interior
of the cave, smiling shyly as he passed them.</p>
<p><img src="bosque6.jpg" class="a" /></p>
<p>“Thank you, Ebenezer Gnome,” Carolina said.</p>
<p>The children crawled out of the cave into the sunlight. The forest
was wet from the rain and everything seemed to shine. They continued on
their way, still following the sun, which was now farther down in the
sky. They soon came to a rapidly flowing river. It wasn’t very wide but
it seemed deep. Not far downstream a tree that had been struck by
lightning lay across the river.</p>
<p>“We can cross on that tree,” Nicolás said. They climbed onto the base
of the tree where its roots were and started across, Nicolás leading the
way. When they were at midstream a branch on the other side cracked
because of the extra weight and the trunk they were on turned, just a
little, but it was enough to make Nicolás lose his balance and fall into
the river. Carolina fell onto the trunk and hugged it so she wouldn’t
fall off. She watched in horror as her brother was swept downstream. She
remembered the water-being’s name and hoped she would get the sign
right. She pulled a hair-clip from her ponytail and scratched the water
sign as well as she could onto the bark of the tree:</p>
<p><img src="tri-3.gif" style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:4em"  /></p>
<p>“Beatrix Nixie, Please come,” she cried. “Help Nicolás”.</p>
<p>No sooner had she pronounced the word “Nixie”, than a green-haired
girl in a blue dress rose from the water in front of Nicolás and raised
her arm. The river’s current reversed and brought Nicolás rushing back
to Carolina. She gave him her hand and he climbed back up onto the tree.
He rested a while and then they made their way to the other bank.</p>
<p><img src="bosque7.jpg" class="a" /></p>
<p>As they walked on Carolina said, “Do you think something else is
going to happen, Nico?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. But if it does, we have our friends to help us.”</p>
<p>“We’re really lucky to have met that little man,” Carolina said.</p>
<p>Something else did happen. They came to a very deep chasm that
extended on both sides as far as they could see and was about ten yards
wide.</p>
<p>“What are we going to do now, Nico?” Carolina asked her brother.</p>
<p>The sun was now so low in the sky that they could no longer see it,
only its glow above the trees. If they couldn’t get across the chasm
soon they’d have to spend the night in the woods. Nicolás’s clothes were
still wet and it was beginning to get cold. </p>
<p>Nicolás felt in his pocket, but the twig was gone. He picked up
another and scratched the air sign on the ground:</p>
<p><img src="tri-4.gif" style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:4em"  /></p>
<p>“Sylvia Sylph, are you there?” he called. The figure of a little
girl, even smaller than Ebenezer Gnome, appeared before them. She was
hard to see because she was transparent and flowed from place to place
without touching the ground.</p>
<p>“We have to get across the chasm, Sylvia Sylph. Can you help us?”
Nicolás said.        </p>
<p>Sylvia Sylph smiled and came closer. They felt a rush of warm air
under them that lifted them up high over the chasm and set them down
softly on the other side.</p>
<p><img src="bosque8.jpg" class="a" /></p>
<p>“Oh, thank you, Sylvia,” Carolina said, but Sylvia Sylph was nowhere
to be seen.</p>
<p>“Come on, Carolina,” Nicolás said, “before it gets dark”.</p>
<p>It didn’t take them long to reach the edge of the forest from where
they could see Aunt Nélida’s farmhouse with its lights already on. They
ran towards it. When they were almost there they turned and looked back
at the forest. The little man stood at its edge, with Rusty Salamander
and Ebenezer Gnome on his left and Beatrix Nixie and Sylvia Sylph on his
right. He wore a white tunic with a golden star embossed on it, which
glowed in the twilight through his beard.</p>
<p><img src="tri-5.gif" style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:4em"  /></p>
<p>Carolina and Nicolás waved to them and all five waved back. Then they
vanished.</p>
<p>“The Star-man, that’s what I’ll call him,” Carolina said.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Nicolás agreed, “That’s who he must be.”</p>
<p>When Carolina and Nicolás entered the kitchen, Aunt Nélida was
cooking dinner.</p>
<p>“Hi,” she said. “I was just about to call your mother. I thought you
were going to take an earlier train.”</p>
<p>“We came through the forest,” Nicolás said. “That’s why we’re
late.”</p>
<p>Aunt Nélida laughed. “Oh really?” She didn’t believe that two small
children could walk alone through the forest.</p>
<p>“But we won’t do it again, not till we’re older,” Carolina said. “We
promised the Star-man.”</p>
<p>Aunt Nélida looked at them more closely and saw that Nico’s clothes
were still wet. Then they told her everything that had happened to them.
They repeated the story often after that. Many grown-ups didn’t believe
them, but the children did. And so, finally, did their Aunt Nélida and
their mamá and papá.</p>
