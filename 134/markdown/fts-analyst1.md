Jim Tate was kicked out of Military Intelligence unceremoniously, and he wanted to know why. I was reminded of Jim's story when reading about and sympathizing with Bradley Manning, that private-first-class who sent all the so-called "secret" information to WikiLeaks. I was reminded of how stupid, that's the best word for it, but one could also say inept, bureaucratic, clumsy and a whole list of adjectives from the thesaurus to describe the United States Army -- or, probably, any army. It's just that my experience is with the American version. Just think: a private-first-class sitting in front of a computer somewhere in the desert in Iraq with access to the electronic messages sent from embassies all over the world to the State Department in Washington. Note, however, that Manning is an "intelligence analyst". Why does he have such an important sounding MOS (Military Occupation Specialty) and still be only a Pfc? It's because he's intelligent and maybe he knows a foreign language, it doesn't matter which one; the path to being an intelligence analyst is to know a foreign language. They give you IQ tests when you enter the army, and if your IQ is higher than a baboon's they call you out of formation for duty as something cooler than an infantry grunt.
What I'm about to tell you happened to Jim Tate when there was still a draft and therefore much smarter people were in the service; in fact draftees were often so much more intelligent than officers that it was embarrassing. I could tell you some anecdotes to prove it, but now isn't the time. Maybe later.
It was like this. Back in
the fifties, the United States was engaged in a big ugly war in Korea.
Not as big and ugly as Vietnam, but ugly anyway. Jim and I were drafted
and went to the Army Language School in Monterrey, California instead of
Korea. Lucky us, right? Right. We both scored high on the IQ test, so
they sent us to the School. We hadn't known each other previously, he
being from New York and I from L.A. But we couldn't help becoming
friends because our karma put us together in a twin-bunk cubicle in the
barrack. Jim studied Russian and I German for a year and we were then
sent to Germany as Intelligence analysts to fight the cold war -- a much
more comfortable one than the hot one in Korea.

`<FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 14pt">`{=html}One night over German beer
with a kick, Jim told me why he chose to study Russian. "It was
Dostoyevsky," he said, "The Brothers Karamazov, the most beautiful book
I ever read. Do you remember when Ivan and Alyosha are talking and Ivan
tells him about the children who suffer and it's God's fault, if He even
exists?" I nodded, having read the book hurriedly as an assignment in
college, and not remembering much. "And then comes The Grand Inquisitor?
God, and to think I grew up Catholic," he went on between gulps of beer.
"Dostoyevsky puts it all on the line right there in that chapter. If
Christ were to come back the Church wouldn't even recognize him, for
god's sake, I mean they couldn't, he'd screw everything up for them, the
Church, probably even with new stuff, revelations and stuff." He paused
and looked at me like he wanted to choke me into understanding. "And,"
he went on, "I thought: `<I>`{=html}God, if I could only read this book
in Russian!`</I>`{=html} And that's what I'm doing...trying to do, that
is, I mean it's not easy." That will give you an idea of what kind of
guy Jim Tate was. `</FONT>`{=html}

on to East Germany to check on Russian troop movements. They came back,
were debriefed and the information -- most of it completely useless --
was forwarded to the Order of Battle section, in the U.S. Army occupied
I.G. Farben building, also known colloquially as the I.G. Hochhaus,
where Jim Tate worked. For once the army had got it right, albeit

`<FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 14pt">`{=html}But one day the axe
fell...began to fall, that is. The Commanding Officer of the 7982 Europe
Liaison Unit was a Capt. Olshevski. He spoke Polish because his parents
were immigrants from Poland - is how he got into Military Intelligence.
Officers were in M.I. for one of two reasons: they spoke a foreign
language or they were fuck-ups -- or both. Olshevski was both. He must
have been about 30, 35 at the time, which for us was ancient, with a pot
belly and permanent sweat stains under his armpits, even in winter. He
always wore suspenders, which made it worse. Jim was working in the
"shithole" at the time, what we called the room where papers from
Russian army garbage were analyzed. The Russian soldiers in East Germany
didn't have toilet paper, so they used anything available, the result
being that some of the documents to be analyzed had done all-purpose
duty. Most of it was personal letters to mommy or girlfriends with an
occasional military document of no importance thrown in.

`<FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 14pt">`{=html}`<I>`{=html}A summary
court-martial consists of one commissioned officer, and may try only
enlisted personnel for non-capital offenses. The punishment which may be
imposed depends on the grade of the accused. In the case of enlisted
members above the fourth pay grade, a summary court-martial may impose
any punishment not forbidden by the law except death, dismissal,
dishonorable or bad conduct discharge, confinement for more than 1
month, hard labor without confinement for more than 45 days, restriction
to specified limits for more than 2 months, or forfeiture of more than
two-thirds of 1 month's pay. In the case of all other enlisted members,
the court-martial may also impose confinement for not more than one
month and may reduce the accused to the lowest pay grade, E-1. The
accused has the absolute right to refuse trial by summary court-martial.
The accused does not have the right to representation by an attorney.
The accused does have the right to cross-examine witnesses, to call
witnesses and produce evidence, and to testify or remain
silent.`</I>`{=html}`</FONT>`{=html}

Jim's punishment for something he didn't do. We were all agreed that Jim
could not have committed an error serious enough to warrant punishment
without even being told what it was, and a security breach was out of

`<FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 14pt">`{=html}Three months later, Jim
was surprised when arriving to work in the I.G.Hochhaus to find an
envelope on his desk with his name on it and "Private and Confidential"
stamped in red letters. Inside were his new "orders" - a transfer,
effective immediately, to Special Headquarters Unit, 2nd Armored
Division, Bad Kreuznach, Rheinland-Pfalz. `<I>`{=html}This`</I>`{=html}
was serious. Jim looked through the wall of Olshevski's glass palace in
time to see his C.O. lower his eyes to some paper on his desk. No point
talking to him, Jim thought, he must be behind it. He walked down the
corridor to Staff Sgt Roland's work room, a large room with its the
walls covered with transparent plastic marked in grease pencil with
Soviet military unit designations. Roland was the heart and soul of the
unit. When he was asked how long he'd been in Frankfurt, he always
answered "forever". He knew the Soviet military displacements and order
of battle by heart and could detect the slightest deviation or lie by a
source. Jim showed him his orders. "Know anything about this, sergeant?"
Actually they were drinking buddies. Sgt Roland went to a local Bierhaus
every evening to escape from his wife, Jim went once a week. Roland
talked about anything that came into his head -- classified or not --
once he had a few beers. His southern accent was so thick though that
the East German spies who frequented the place couldn't understand him.

we vowed to get to the bottom of the conspiracy against Jim and, while

If Military Intelligence is a home for fuck-ups, the Special
Headquarters Company in Bad Kreuznach was the geriatric version of same.
A bunch of such extreme fuck-ups that they couldn't even be trusted in
M.I. Basically they did the laundry for the 2nd Armored Division. Not to
mean that they actually `<I>`{=html}did`</I>`{=html} the laundry; they
organized and supervised a militia of Polish refugees who did the actual
work. The unit had about fifty men -- not counting the Poles --
including two full colonels, a Lt. Colonel, a gaggle of captains (no
lieutenants -- too young), a warrant officer, the rest sergeants -- and
now one Pfc who happened to be an intelligence analyst, just like Pfc
Manning. The First Sergeant, who ran a twenty percent loan racket on the
side, was suspicious: What was an intelligence analyst doing in a
laundry company? Actually everyone was nervous, from the colonels on

`<FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 14pt">`{=html}Lt. Colonel Moultrie Banks
was happy though. As you may or may not know, the army divides its
functions into eSes: S1=Command, S2=intelligence, S3=Operations,
S4=administration. Lt. Colonel Banks was S3 officer, but there was no S2
officer, because there was no intelligence. So when Banks saw that Pfc
Jim Tate was an intelligence analyst, he recognized the opportunity for
himself to become S2 as well as S3. The problem was that they had
nothing to classify Secret, let alone Top Secret. Jim solved that
problem, though. On going through the S3 files, he found instructions
from European headquarters in Heidelberg for the evacuation of
dependants in case of a Russian attack. All dependants should always
have their gas tanks at least half-full (or half-empty? Jim thought) and
keep a week's supply of non-perishable food on hand, warm clothes, etc.,

`<FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 14pt">`{=html}I haven't yet mentioned
one very important element of this story. You may have guessed: the love
angle. Jim bought a Vespa, one of those Italian scooters which were
cheap and reliable, on which he came to Frankfurt almost every weekend
-- and it wasn't to see me. Hanna was a German girl he'd met at the
Deutsch-Amerikanische Freundschafts-Klub and he'd fallen hard. That was
the reason his transfer to Bad Kreuznach affected him so strongly: it
meant he could only see Hanna on weekends instead of almost every day.
Actually, I had much to do with their relationship. You see, groups like
the German-American Friendship Club are great places to recruit sources.
After all, the Germans who went there were already susceptible to
Americans. Remember that all this was prior to Vietnam and American
soldiers were loved -- not necessarily respected as soldiers, the
Germans were much better at that, but loved as protectors against the
Russians and the inventors of blue jeans. `</FONT>`{=html}
```{=html}

```
```{=html}
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">
```
`<FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 14pt">`{=html}Hanna was, in fact, one of
my sources. She had been to East Germany several times and had brought
back the usual information: Russian vehicle numbers. If a truck or a
tank bore a certain number, we knew it belonged to a certain Soviet
division and was where it was supposed to be. If it belonged to a unit
that was supposed to be in Poland and it was reported near Potsdam, it
meant either the unit had moved or the source was lying. That's why we
demanded photographic proof. Most sources did it for the money and would
lie if they could get away with it. Not to help the Russians, but to
avoid the danger of being caught. Having to take photos naturally
increased the danger and the amount of money we had to pay them.
`<br>`{=html}`<br>`{=html}I had invited Jim to the Club, or rather told
him about it, because anyone could go. I warned him that if it was a
good place for us to recruit spies, it must also be good for the East
Germans to do the same. We both laughed. What a stupid game! In fact I
had three sources from the club, the other two being German males -- one
I suspected of being an East German spy. That's why I was staying away
from the club: if one of my sources was on the dark side, he could
suspect every other German member and..and...and. When Jim found out
that Hanna was working for me, he demanded that I drop her. He was
worried that she was in too much danger. She was originally from the
East and although she never went back to her hometown, it was always
possible that she could be recognized somewhere else. I was reluctant so
Jim said he was going to tell her that he knew and she should stop. That
was a no-no, because if I reported him for it he'd be in deep shit. But
he knew I wouldn't do that, so I gave in and told her she was out of the
game. I told my captain that she wanted out. `</FONT>`{=html}

`<FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 14pt">`{=html}But Jim had not forgotten
Capt. Olshevsky. He insisted that revenge was not his motive, but that
there was something fishy about Olshevsky wanting to get rid of him
without a motive for it. So one weekend a few months after Jim had been
transferred we decided to follow Olshevski when he left the office in
the Hochhaus, on the remote chance that we'd find out something to

Hochhaus late, probably the last one out, carrying an attaché case. Jim
remembered that he habitually arrived somewhat late in the morning and
was always still in the office when everyone else left. Not unlike the
Captain of a ship. We expected him to go by car to the officers' housing
area, but he walked down Eschersheimer Landstrasse about ten blocks
until he came to Mozartstrasse, where he turned left. Jim and I, both
graduates of the M.I. surveillance course, knew enough not to hurry to
the corner, in case the target had suspicions that he was being followed
and was waiting to confront us with a "Gotcha!" But no, I was on the
other side of the street and strolled past the corner first. I looked
left and saw Olshevsky standing before an apartment building entrance.
Apparently he had just rung a bell and was waiting for an answer.

walked back the way he came and when he turned the corner I hurried

hurrying back toward the Hochhaus. Just then Jim left the building, so I
motioned him to hurry up so we could trail Olshevki in duo as we had
coming. Jim ran to the corner and we followed Olshevsky back to the
Hochhaus parking lot, where he got into his car -- a Mercedes Benz --

which was most likely paid into a numbered Swiss account. They needed
more time. So tomorrow, Saturday, Hanna would put Olshevski's envelope
(a new one, the old one having obviously been opened) in the usual drop
in the Stadtswald. Then Hanna would go to the German CIA equivalent.
They call it the Defense of the Constitution Office. She would tell them
that she was recruited by the Stasi by force when she was already in the
west. They said her mother, still in the east, would suffer if she
didn't cooperate. Now, however, her mother has also defected -- and
would be present during the interview as proof. She didn't know anything
else, she was a unwilling tool, a puppet. They probably wouldn't believe
that story, but they would certainly want to check the part about her
receiving classified documents from "an American intelligence officer"
whose name she did not know. They would be able to check it out. Which
they did. `</FONT>`{=html}

She told him that Hanna was sick and she was her temporary replacement.
Please come in, said the spider to the fly. Olshevsky was suspicious
because he hadn't been told in advance, but what the hell, he thought,
these people are like that. Like what? He placed the attache case on the
table as always, opened its false bottom and removed the thick envelope.
He turned to leave and found the door blocked by two plain-clothes
policemen, who turned him over to the Defense of the Constitution folks.
If still alive, ex-Captain Olshevsky is most likely in a military
stockade somewhere, after serving a sentence in Germany for spying
against the Federal Republic a.k.a. West Germany.`</FONT>`{=html}

Bavaria. That was even farther from Bad Kreuznach than Frankfurt, but
Jim solved the problem in his usual resourceful, but in this case
extreme, manner. He married Hanna. After his military service ended, he
stayed in Germany and studied philosophy at the University of Munich,
financed by the G.I. Bill of rights. Hanna and her mother opened a
cabaret called the "Dreigröschen Cabaret" after Brecht's Threepenny
Opera, which eventually became `<I>`{=html}the`</I>`{=html} "in"
