# A Good Deed from the Wicked Witch?

### Actually Ending the War in Afghanistan

 *Let\'s open up and sing, and ring the bells out\
 Ding-dong! the merry-oh sing it high, sing it low\
 Let them know the wicked witch is dead!*

 Within establishment circles, Donald Trump's failure to win
 re-election has prompted merry singing and bell-ringing galore. If you
 read the *New York Times *or watch MSNBC, the song featured in the
 1939 movie *The Wizard of Oz *nicely captures the mood of the moment.

 As a consequence, expectations for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to put
 America back on the path to the Emerald City after a dispiriting
 four-year detour are sky high. The new administration will defeat
 Covid-19, restore prosperity, vanquish racism, reform education,
 expand healthcare coverage, tackle climate change, and provide an
 effective and humane solution to the problem of undocumented migrants.
 Oh, and Biden will also return the United States to its accustomed
 position of global leadership. And save America's soul to boot.

 So we are told.

 That these expectations are deemed even faintly credible qualifies as
 passing strange. After all, the outcome of the 2020 presidential
 election turned less on competing approaches to governance than on the
 character of the incumbent. It wasn't Joe Biden as principled
 standard-bearer of enlightened twenty-first-century liberalism who
 prevailed. It was Joe Biden, a retread centrist pol who emerged as the
 last line of defense shielding America and the world from four more
 years of Donald Trump.

 So the balloting definitively resolved only a single question: by 80
 million to 74 million votes, a margin of six million, Americans
 signaled their desire to terminate Trump's lease on the White House.
 Yet even if repudiating the president, voters hardly repudiated
 Trumpism. Republicans actually gained seats in the House of
 Representatives and appear likely to retain control of the Senate.

 On November 3rd, a twofold transfer of power commenced. A rapt public
 has fixed its attention on the first of those transfers: Biden's
 succession to the presidency (and Trump's desperate resistance to the
 inevitable outcome). But a second, hardly less important transfer of
 power is also occurring. Once it became clear that Trump was not going
 to win a second term, control of the Republican Party began reverting
 from the president to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. The
 implications of that shift are immense, as Biden, himself a longtime
 member of the Senate, no doubt appreciates.

 Consider this telling anecdote from former President Barack Obama's
 just published memoir. Obama had tasked then-Vice President Biden with
 cajoling McConnell into supporting a piece of legislation favored by
 the administration. After Biden made his pitch, the hyper-partisan
 McConnell dourly
 [replied](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/obama-book-biden-trump-palin/2020/11/13/36c4828a-25b8-11eb-8599-406466ad1b8e_story.html),
 "You must be under the mistaken impression that I care." End of
 negotiation.

 Perhaps the Democrats will miraculously win both Senate seats in
 Georgia's January runoff elections and so consign McConnell to the
 status of minority leader. If they don't, let us not labor under the
 mistaken impression that he'll support Biden's efforts to defeat
 Covid-19, restore prosperity, vanquish racism, reform education,
 expand healthcare coverage, tackle climate change, or provide an
 effective and humane solution to the problem of undocumented migrants.

 It's a given that McConnell isn't any more interested in saving souls
 than he is in passing legislation favored by Democrats. That leaves
 restoring American global leadership as the sole remaining arena where
 President Biden might elicit from a McConnell-controlled GOP something
 other than unremitting obstructionism.

 And that, in turn, brings us face to face with the issue Democrats and
 Republicans alike would prefer to ignore: the U.S. penchant for war.
 Since the end of the Cold War and especially since the terror attacks
 of 9/11, successive administrations have relied on armed force to
 assert, affirm, or at least shore up America's claim to global
 leadership. The results have not been pretty. A series of needless and
 badly mismanaged wars have contributed appreciably \-- more even than
 Donald Trump's zany ineptitude \-- to the growing perception that the
 United States is now a declining power. That perception is not without
 validity. Over the past two decades, wars have depleted America's
 strength and undermined its global influence.

 So, as the U.S. embarks on the post-Trump era, what are the prospects
 that a deeply divided government presiding over a deeply divided
 polity will come to a more reasoned and prudent attitude toward war? A
 lot hinges on whether Joe Biden and Mitch McConnell can agree on an
 answer to that question.

 **An Unexpected Gift for "Sleepy Joe"**

 As his inevitable exit from the White House approaches, President
 Trump himself may be forcing the issue.

 One of the distinctive attributes of our 45th president is that he
 never seemed [terribly
 interested](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/nearly-60-percent-trump-s-schedule-executive-time-report-says-n966376)
 in actually tending to the duties of his office. He does not, in fact,
 possess a work ethic in any traditional sense. He prefers to swagger
 and strut rather than deliberate and decide. Once it became clear that
 he wasn't going to win a second term, he visibly [gave
 up](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-ignores-duties/2020/11/12/02bfbc36-2507-11eb-a688-5298ad5d580a_story.html)
 even the pretense of governing. Today, he golfs, tweets, and rails.
 According to news reports, he no longer even bothers to set aside time
 for the daily presidential intelligence briefing.

 As the clock runs out, however, certain Trumpian impulses remain in
 play. The war in Afghanistan, now in its 19th year, offers a notable
 example. In 2001, President George W. Bush ordered U.S. forces to
 invade the country, but prematurely turned his attention to a bigger
 and more disastrous misadventure in Iraq. Barack Obama inherited the
 Afghanistan War, promised to win it, and ordered a large-scale
 [surge](https://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/175176/tomgram:__state_of_surge,_afghanistan/)
 in the U.S. troop presence there. Yet the conflict stubbornly dragged
 on through his two terms. As for candidate Trump, during campaign
 2016, he vowed to end it once and for all. In office, however, he
 never managed to pull the plug \-- until now, that is.

 Soon after losing the election, the president ousted several senior
 Pentagon civilians, including Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, and
 [replaced
 them](https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-army-christopher-miller-mark-esper-james-anderson-95f848b7cdaba116b7c09787edb4c839)
 (for a couple of months anyway) with loyalists sharing his oft-stated
 commitment to "ending endless wars." Within days of taking office, new
 Acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller issued a
 [letter](https://media.defense.gov/2020/Nov/14/2002535407/-1/-1/0/INITIAL-MESSAGE-TO-THE-DEPARTMENT.PDF?source=GovDelivery)
 to the troops, signaling his own commitment to that task.

 "We are not a people of perpetual war," he wrote, describing endless
 war as "the antithesis of everything for which we stand and for which
 our ancestors fought." The time for accepting the inevitable had now
 arrived. "All wars must end," he continued, adding that trying harder
 was not going to produce a better outcome. "We gave it our all," he
 concluded. "Now, it\'s time to come home."

 Miller avoided using terms like victory or defeat, success or failure,
 and did not specify an actual timetable for a full-scale withdrawal.
 Yet Trump had already made his intentions clear: he wanted all U.S.
 troops out of Afghanistan by the end of the year and [preferably by
 Christmas](https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-says-he-wants-all-troops-in-afghanistan-home-by-christmas-going-further-than-security-adviser-11602130656).
 Having forgotten or punted on innumerable other promises, Trump
 appeared determined to make good on this one. It's likely, in fact,
 that Miller's primary \-- perhaps only \-- charge during his
 abbreviated tour of duty as Pentagon chief is to enable Trump to claim
 success in terminating at least one war.

 So during this peculiar betwixt-and-between moment of ours, with one
 administration packing its bags and the next one trying to get its
 bearings, a question of immense significance to the future course of
 American statecraft presents itself: Will the United States at long
 last ring down the curtain on the most endless of its endless wars?
 Or, under the guise of seeking a "responsible end," will it pursue the
 irresponsible course of prolonging a demonstrably futile enterprise
 through another presidency?

 As Miller will soon discover, if he hasn't already, his generals don't
 concur with the commander-in-chief's determination to "come home."
 Whether in Afghanistan or Somalia, Iraq,
 [Syria](https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2020/11/outgoing-syria-envoy-admits-hiding-us-troop-numbers-praises-trumps-mideast-record/170012/),
 or
 [Europe](https://www.stripes.com/news/europe/troop-pullout-from-germany-likely-to-be-quashed-by-biden-analysts-say-1.651518),
 they have demonstrated great skill in foiling his occasional gestures
 aimed at reducing the U.S. military's overseas profile.

 The available evidence suggests that Joe Biden's views align with
 those of the generals. True, the conduct and legacy of recent wars
 played next to no role in deciding the outcome of the 2020
 presidential election (suggesting that many Americans have made their
 peace with endless war). Still, given expectations that anyone
 aspiring to high office these days must stake out a position on every
 conceivable issue and promise something for everyone, candidate Biden
 [spelled out](https://joebiden.com/joes-vision/) his intentions
 regarding Afghanistan.

 Basically, he wants to have it both ways. So he is on record
 [insisting
 that](https://www.stripes.com/biden-says-us-must-maintain-small-force-in-middle-east-has-no-plans-for-major-defense-cuts-1.644631)
 "these 'forever wars' have to end," while simultaneously proposing to
 maintain a contingent of American troops in Afghanistan to "take out
 terrorist groups who are going to continue to emerge." In other words,
 Biden proposes to declare that the longest war in U.S. history has
 ended, while simultaneously underwriting its perpetuation.

 Such a prospect will find favor with the generals, members of the
 foreign policy establishment, and media hawks. Yet hanging on in
 Afghanistan (or other active theaters of war) will contribute nothing
 to Biden's larger promise to "build back better." Indeed, the
 [staggering
 expenses](https://www.brown.edu/news/2019-11-13/costsofwar) that
 accompany protracted wars will undermine his prospects of making good
 on his domestic reform agenda. It's the dilemma that Lyndon Johnson
 faced in the mid-1960s: You can have your Great Society, Mr.
 President, or you can have your war in Vietnam, but you can't have
 both.

 Biden will face an analogous problem. Put simply, his stated position
 on Afghanistan is at odds with the larger aspirations of his
 presidency.

 **At Long Last an Exit Strategy?**

 As a practical matter, the odds of Trump actually ending the U.S.
 military presence in Afghanistan between now and his departure from
 office are nil. The logistical challenges are daunting, especially
 given that the pick-up team now running the Pentagon is made up of
 something other than all-stars. And the generals will surely drag
 their feet, while mobilizing allies not just in the punditocracy but
 in the [Republican Party
 itself](https://redstate.com/jeffc/2020/11/17/republicans-balk-at-trumps-afghanistan-troop-withdrawal-n281192).

 As a practical matter, Acting Secretary Miller has already bowed to
 reality. The definition of success now is, it seems, to cut the force
 there roughly in half, from [4,500 to
 2,500](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/17/world/asia/afghanistan-troop-withdrawal.html),
 by Inauguration Day, with the remainder of U.S. troops supposedly
 coming out of Afghanistan by May 2021 (months after both Trump and
 Miller will be out of a job).

 So call it Operation Half a Loaf. But half is better than none. Even
 if Trump won't succeed in reducing U.S. troop strength in Afghanistan
 to zero, I'm rooting for him anyway. As, indeed, Joe Biden should be
 \-- because if Trump makes headway in shutting down America's war
 there, Biden will be among the principal beneficiaries.

 Whatever his actual motives, Trump has cracked open a previously shut
 door to an exit strategy. Through that door lies the opportunity of
 turning the page on a disastrous era of American statecraft dominated
 by a misplaced obsession with events in the Greater Middle East.

 Twin convictions shaped basic U.S. policy during this period: the
 first was that the United States has vital interests at stake in this
 region, even in utterly remote parts of it like Afghanistan; the
 second, that the United States can best advance those interests by
 amassing and employing military power. The first of those convictions
 turned out to be wildly misplaced, the second tragically wrong-headed.
 Yet pursuant to those very mistaken beliefs, successive
 administrations have flung away lives, treasure, and influence with
 complete abandon. The American people have gained less than nothing in
 return. In fact, in terms of where taxpayer dollars were invested,
 they've lost their shirts.

 Acting Secretary Miller's charge to the troops plainly acknowledges a
 bitter truth to which too few members of the Washington establishment
 have been willing to admit: the time to move on from this misguided
 project is now. To the extent that Donald Trump's lame-duck
 administration begins the process of extricating the United States
 from Afghanistan, he will demonstrate the feasibility of doing so
 elsewhere as well. Tired arguments for staying the course could then
 lose their persuasive power.

 Doubtless, after all these disastrous years, there will be negative
 consequences to leaving Afghanistan. Ill-considered and mismanaged
 wars inevitably yield poisonous fruit. There will be further bills to
 pay. Still, ending the U.S. war there will establish a precedent for
 ending our military involvement in Iraq, Syria, and Somalia as well.
 Terminating direct U.S. military involvement across the Greater Middle
 East and much of Africa will create an opportunity to reconfigure U.S.
 policy in a world that has changed dramatically since the United
 States recklessly embarked upon its crusade to transform great swathes
 of the Islamic world.

 Biden himself should welcome such an opportunity. Admittedly, Mitch
 McConnell, no longer fully subservient to President Trump,
 [predicts](https://thehill.com/policy/defense/526194-mcconnell-warns-trump-against-troop-drawdown-in-afghanistan)
 that withdrawing from Afghanistan will produce an outcome "reminiscent
 of the humiliating American departure from Saigon in 1975." In
 reality, of course, failure in Vietnam stemmed not from the decision
 to leave, but from an erroneous conviction that it was incumbent upon
 Americans to decide the destiny of the Vietnamese people. The big
 mistake occurred not in 1975 when American troops finally departed,
 but a decade earlier when President Johnson decided that it was
 incumbent upon the United States to Americanize the war.

 As Americans learned in Vietnam, the only way to end a war gone wrong
 is to leave the field of battle. If that describes Trump's intentions
 in Afghanistan, then we may finally have some reason to be grateful
 for his service to our nation. With time, Joe Biden and Mitch
 McConnell might even come to see the wisdom of doing so.

 And then, of course, they can bicker about the shortest path to the
 Emerald City.
