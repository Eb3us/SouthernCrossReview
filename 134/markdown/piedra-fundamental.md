# Christ Comes to Skopelos

## by Frank Thomas Smith


Christ consents to be called\
To Skopelos\
One Easter Sunday\
Several years before the year\
Two-thousand-twenty.\
\
They\'ve been calling him continually\
In all their white-walled\
Icon-laden churches,\
Never expecting he\'d hear their songs.\
\
He heard but will come instead\
To a hill above the town\
Where a donkey grazes\
And cypresses stand in rows\
Like green flame.\
\
No one will see him\
No one will hear him\
When Christ consents to be called\
To Skopelos\
One Easter Sunday still to come.

Christ came to Skopelos\
One Easter Sunday\
In the year, this very year\
Two-thousand-twenty.

They\'d been calling him relentlessly\
In all their white-walled\
Icon-laden churches,\
Never expecting he\'d hear their chants.

He heard, but came instead\
To a hill above the town\
Where a donkey grazes still\
And cypresses stand in rows\
Like green flame.\
\
No one saw him,\
No one heard him\
When Christ came to Skopelos\
One Easter Sunday a week ago.
