### Lecture Three

## By Rudolf Steiner

Basel, September 17, 1909, GA 114

Whoever turns to the Gospel of Luke will, at first, only be able to feel
dimly something of what it contains; but an inkling will then dawn on
him that whole worlds, vast spiritual worlds, are revealed by this
Gospel. After what was said in the last lecture, this will be obvious to
us, for as we heard, spiritual research shows how the Buddhistic
world-conception, with everything it was able to give to mankind, flowed
into the Gospel of Luke. It may truly be said that Buddhism radiates
from this Gospel, but in a special form, comprehensible to the simplest
and unsophisticated mind.

As could be gathered from the last lecture and will become particularly
clear to-day, to understand Buddhism as presented to the world in the
teachings of the great Buddha demands the application of lofty
conceptions and an ascent to the pure, ethereal heights of the Spirit; a
very great deal of preparation is required to grasp the essence of
Buddhism. Its spiritual substance is contained in the Gospel of Luke in
a form that can influence everyone who recognizes concepts and ideas
that are essential for humanity. This will be readily understood when we
get to the root of the mystery underlying the Gospel of Luke. Not only
are the spiritual attainments of Buddhism presented to us through this
Gospel; they come before us in an even nobler form, as though raised to
a level higher than when they were a gift to humanity in India some six
hundred years before our era.

In the lecture yesterday we spoke of Buddhism as the purest teaching of
compassion and love; from the place in the world where Buddha worked a
gospel of love and compassion streamed into the whole spiritual
evolution of the Earth. The gospel of love and compassion lives in the
true Buddhist when his own heart feels the suffering confronting him in
the outer world from all living creatures. There we encounter Buddhistic
love and compassion in the fullest sense of the words; but from the
Gospel of Luke there streams to us something that is more than this
all-embracing love and compassion. It might be described as the
translation of love and compassion into *deed*. Compassion in the
highest sense of the word is the ideal of the Buddhist; the aim of one
who lives according to the message of the Gospel of Luke is to unfold
love that *acts*. The true Buddhist can himself share in the sufferings
of the sick; from the Gospel of Luke comes the call to take active steps
to do whatever is possible to bring about healing. Buddhism helps us to
understand everything that stirs the human soul; the Gospel of Luke
calls upon us to abstain from passing judgment, to do *more* than is
done to us, to give *more* than we receive! Although in this Gospel
there is the purest, most genuine Buddhism, love translated into deed
must be regarded as a progression, a sublimation, of Buddhism.

This aspect of Christianity --- Buddhism raised to a higher level ---
could be truly described only by one possessed of the heart and
disposition of the writer of the Gospel of Luke. It was eminently
possible for him to portray the Christ Jesus as the Healer of body and
soul because having himself worked as a physician he was able to write
in the way that appealed so deeply to the hearts of men. That he
recorded what he had to say about the Christ Jesus from the standpoint
of a physician will become more and more apparent as we penetrate into
the depths of the Gospel.

But something else strikes us when we consider what an impression this
Gospel can make upon even the most childlike natures. The lofty
teachings of Buddhism, to understand which mature intelligence is
required, appear to us in the Gospel of Luke as though rejuvenated, as
though born anew from a fountain of youth. Buddhism is a fruit on the
tree of humanity, and when we find it again in this Gospel it seems to
be like a rejuvenation of what it had previously been. It is only
possible to understand this rejuvenation by paying close attention to
the great Buddha\'s teachings themselves and discerning with spiritual
eyes the powers working in Buddha\'s soul.

In the first place it must be remembered that the Buddha had been a
Bodhisattva, that is to say, a very lofty Being able to gaze deeply into
the mysteries of existence. As a Bodhisattva, the Buddha had
participated in the evolution of humanity throughout the ages. When in
the epoch following Atlantis the first post-Atlantean civilization was
established and promoted, Buddha was already present as Bodhisattva and,
acting as an intermediary, conveyed to man from the spiritual worlds the
teachings indicated in the lecture yesterday. He had been present in
Atlantean and even in Lemurian times. And because he had reached such a
high stage of development, he was also able, during the twenty-nine
years of his final existence as Bodhisattva, from his birth to the
moment when he became Buddha, to recollect stage by stage all the
communities in which he had lived before incarnating for the last time
in India. He could look back upon his participation in the labours of
humanity, upon his existence in the divine-spiritual worlds in order
that he might bring down from there what it was his mission to impart to
mankind. It was indicated yesterday that even an Individuality of this
lofty rank must live through again, briefly at any rate, what he has
already learnt. Thus Buddha describes how while still a Bodhisattva he
gradually rose to higher stages of consciousness, how his spiritual
vision became ever more perfect and his enlightenment complete.

We are told how he described to his disciples the path his soul had
traversed and how he was able by degrees to recollect his experiences in
the past. He spoke to them somewhat as follows. 'There was a time, O
monks, when an all-pervading light appeared to me from the spiritual
world, but as yet I could distinguish nothing in it --- neither forms,
nor pictures: my enlightenment was not yet pure enough. Then I began to
see not only the light, but single pictures, single forms, within the
light; but I could not distinguish what these forms and pictures
denoted: my enlightenment was not yet pure enough. Then I began to
realize that spiritual beings were expressing themselves in these forms
and pictures; but again I could not distinguish to what kingdoms of the
spiritual world these beings belonged: my enlightenment was not yet pure
enough. Then I learnt to know to which of the various kingdoms of the
spiritual world these several beings belonged; but I could not yet
distinguish through what actions they had acquired their place in the
spiritual realms, nor what was their condition of soul: for my
enlightenment was not yet pure enough. Then came the time when I could
discern through what actions these spiritual beings had acquired their
place in the spiritual realms, and what was their condition of soul; but
I could not yet distinguish with which particular spiritual beings I
myself had lived in former times, nor how I was related to them: for my
enlightenment was not yet pure enough. Then came the time when I was
able to know that I was together with certain beings in particular
epochs and was related to them in this way or in that: I knew what my
previous lives had been. Now my enlightenment was pure!'

In this way Buddha indicated to his disciples how he had gradually
worked his way to knowledge which, although he had already attained it
in an earlier epoch, had nevertheless to be freshly acquired in
accordance with the conditions prevailing in each successive
incarnation. In Buddha\'s case this knowledge had necessarily to be in a
form in keeping with his complete descent into a physical human body. If
we enter into these things with the right feeling we shall get an
inkling of the greatness and significance of the Individuality who
incarnated at that time in the King\'s son of the family of Sakya.
Buddha knew that the world he himself could again experience and behold
would be inaccessible to men\'s ordinary faculty of vision in the
immediate present and future. Only 'Initiates' --- and Buddha himself
was an Initiate --- could gaze into the spiritual world; for normal
humanity this was no longer possible. Inherited remains of the old
clairvoyance had become increasingly rare. But Buddha had not come to
speak to men only of what Initiates had to say; his primary mission was
to convey to them knowledge of the forces that must flow *out of the
human soul itself*. Hence he could not speak only of the fruits of his
own enlightenment, but he said to himself: 'I must speak to men of what
they can attain through the higher development of their *own inner
nature* and of the faculties belonging to this epoch.

In the course of Earth evolution men will gradually come to recognize
the content of Buddha\'s teaching as something that their own reason,
their own soul, tells them. But long, long ages will have to pass before
all men are mature enough to produce *out of their own souls* what
Buddha was the first to bring to expression in the form of pure
knowledge. For to develop certain faculties in later ages is not the
same as to bring them forth for the first time from the depths of the
human soul. Let us take another example. To-day, even the young are able
to assimiliate the principles of logic and unfold logical thinking.
Logical thinking is now one of the general faculties possessed by man
and developed from his own inner nature. But it was in Aristotle, the
great Greek thinker, that this faculty first arose from a human soul.
There is a difference between bringing forth something for the first
time from the soul and bringing it forth after it has already been
developing for a period in humanity.

Buddha\'s message to men was among the very greatest of teachings and
will remain so for long, long ages. Hence the soul of a Bodhisattva, the
soul of one enlightened to such a supreme degree, was needed in order
that this teaching should for the first time become a living power in a
human being. Only the highest degree of enlightenment could enable the
soul to give birth to what was to become a universal endowment of
mankind --- namely, the lofty doctrine of compassion and love. Buddha\'s
message had to be presented in words familiar to the humanity of that
time, especially to the people of his homeland. Reference has already
been made to the fact that at the time of Buddha the Sankhya and Yoga
philosophies were being taught in India. From them were derived the
terminologies and concepts in use at the time. Anyone who brought a new
message had necessarily to use current parlance, and Buddha too clothed
what was living within him in concepts familiar to his contemporaries.
True, he re-cast these concepts into completely new forms but he was
obliged to use them. The principle of all evolution must be that the
future is based on the past. And so Buddha clothed his sublime wisdom in
expressions customary in the Indian teachings of that time.

We must now try to picture what Buddha experienced during the seven-day
period of his 'Enlightenment' under the Bodhi-tree. This teaching was to
become the deepest, most intimate concern of mankind. Let us therefore
try to conceive, even if with thoughts only approximately adequate, what
profound experiences were undergone by Buddha under the Bodhi-tree and
then came to expression in his soul.

He might have said that there were times in the ancient past when many
human beings were dimly clairvoyant and that in an even more distant
past this was the case with everyone. What does it mean --- to be 'dimly
clairvoyant', or 'clairvoyant'? To be clairvoyant means to be able to
use the organs of the *etheric body*. When a person is able to use the
organs of his astral body only, he can, it is true, inwardly feel and
experience profound mysteries, but there can be no actual vision.
Clairvoyance cannot arise until what is experienced in the astral body
makes its 'impress' in the etheric body. Even the old, dim clairvoyance
originated from the fact that in the etheric body, which had not yet
passed completely into the physical body, there were organs which it was
still possible for ancient humanity to use. What, therefore, was it that
men lost in the course of time? They lost the capacity to use the organs
of the etheric body! They were obliged to make use of the external
organs of the physical body only, experiencing in the astral body, in
the form of thoughts, feelings and mental pictures, what the physical
body transmitted. All this passed through the soul of the great Buddha
as the expression of what he experienced. He said to himself: 'Men have
lost the capacity to use the organs of their etheric bodies. They
experience in their astral bodies what they learn from the outer world
through the instrumentality of their physical bodies.'

Buddha now concerned himself with this significant question: 'When the
eye perceives the colour red, when the ear hears a sound, a tone, when
the sense of taste has received some impression, under normal conditions
these impressions become concepts and ideas, are inwardly experienced in
the astral body. If they were experienced in this way alone, they could
not, in normal circumstances, be accompanied by pain and suffering. Were
man simply to abandon himself to the impressions of the outer world as
the latter with its light, colours, sounds, and so forth, affects his
senses, he would pass through the world without experiencing pain and
suffering from the impressions made upon him. Only under certain
conditions can pain and suffering be experienced by man.'

Hence the great Buddha sought to discover the conditions under which man
experiences pain, suffering, cares and afflictions. When and why do the
impressions of the outer world become fraught with suffering? Then he
said to himself: Looking back into ancient times, it is revealed that in
men\'s earlier incarnations on the Earth certain beings worked into
their astral bodies from two sides. In the course of incarnations
through the epochs of Lemuria and Atlantis, the Luciferic beings
penetrated into human nature, and their influences took actual effect in
the human astral body. Then, from the Atlantean epoch onwards, man was
also worked upon by beings under the leadership of Ahriman. Thus in the
course of his earlier incarnations, man was subjected to the influences
of both the Luciferic and Ahrimanic beings. Had these beings not worked
upon him, he could have acquired neither freedom nor the capacity to
distinguish between good and evil, nor free will. From a higher point of
view, therefore, it is fortunate that these influences were exercised
upon him, although it is true that in a certain respect they led him
from divine-spiritual heights more deeply into material existence than
he would otherwise have descended.

The great Buddha could therefore say that man bears within himself
influences due to the invasion of Lucifer on the one side and Ahriman on
the other. These influences have remained with him from earlier
incarnations. When, with his old clairvoyance, man was still able to
gaze into the spiritual world, he perceived the influences of Lucifer
and Ahriman and could clearly distinguish them. He could say: This
particular influence comes from Lucifer, this other from Ahriman. And
inasmuch as with his vision of the astral world he perceived the harmful
influences of Lucifer and Ahriman, he could reckon with and protect
himself from them. He knew too, how he had come into contact with these
Beings. There was a time --- so said Buddha --- when men knew whence
came the influences they had borne within themselves from incarnation to
incarnation since bygone ages. But with the loss of the old clairvoyance
this knowledge was also lost; man is now ignorant of the influences that
have worked upon his soul through the series of incarnations. The
earlier clairvoyant knowledge has been replaced by ignorance. Darkness
now envelops man; he cannot perceive whence come these influences of
Lucifer and Ahriman, but they are there within him! He has within him
something of which he knows nothing. It would be folly to deny the
reality and effectiveness of something that exists, even though people
are ignorant of it. The influences that have penetrated into man from
incarnation to incarnation are working in him. They are there and they
work through his whole life --- only he is unaware of them!

What effect have these influences in man? Although he cannot actually
recognize them for what they are, he feels them; there is a power within
him that is the expression of what has continued from incarnation to
incarnation and has entered into his present form of existence. These
forces, the nature of which man cannot recognize, are represented by his
desire for external life, for experience in the world, by his thirst and
craving for life. Thus the ancient Luciferic and Ahrimanic influences
work within man as the thirst, the craving for existence. This 'thirst
for existence' continues from incarnation to incarnation. This, in
effect, is what the great Buddha said. But to his intimate pupils he
gave more detailed explanations.

How he presented what he thus felt can be understood only if there has
been a certain preparation through Anthroposophy. We know that when a
man dies his astral body and his Ego leave the physical and etheric
bodies. Then he has before him, for a certain time, the great
memory-tableau of his last life in the form of a vast picture. The main
part of his etheric body is then cast off as a second corpse and
something like an extract or essence of this etheric body remains; he
bears this extract with him through the periods of Kamaloka and Devachan
and brings it back again into his next incarnation. While he is in
Kamaloka there is inscribed into this life-extract everything he has
experienced through his deeds, everything that has been incurred in the
way of human Karma and for which he has to make compensation. All this
unites with the extract of the etheric body which passes on from one
incarnation to another and man brings it with him when he again comes
into existence through birth. The term in Oriental literature for what
we call 'etheric body' is 'Linga Sharira'. Thus it is an extract of
Linga Sharira that man takes with him from incarnation to incarnation.

Buddha was able to say: At birth, the human being brings with him, in
his Linga Sharira, everything it contains from his former incarnations;
it is inscribed there everything of which man, in the present epoch,
knows nothing and over which spreads the darkness of ignorance, although
it asserts itself as the 'thirst for existence', the 'craving for life'.
In what is called the 'craving for life', Buddha saw everything that
comes from previous incarnations and drives man to long avidly for
enjoyment in the world, so that he does not merely move though the world
of colours, tones and other impressions, but yearns for this world. This
force exists in man from previous incarnations. Buddha\'s pupils called
it 'Samskara'. Buddha spoke to his intimate pupils to the following
effect. --- What is characteristic of man is his ignorance, his
'non-perception' of something very significant that is in him. Because
of this ignorance, this non-perception, everything that confronts man
from the Luciferic and Ahrimanic beings and to which he might otherwise
adopt an effective attitude, is transformed into the 'thirst for
existence', into slumbering forces which rumble darkly within him from
previous incarnations. Man\'s present thinking has developed from
'Samskara' and this is why, in the present cycle of human evolution,
nobody is able, without further effort, to think objectively.

Mark well the fine distinction made clear by Buddha to his pupils: the
distinction between objective thinking which has nothing but the
'object' in view, and thinking influenced by the forces arising from the
Linga Sharira. Consider how you acquire your 'opinions' about things;
ask yourselves how much you acquire from these things because they
please you and how much because you observe them objectively. Everything
acquired as an apparent truth, not as the result of objective thinking,
but because old inclinations have been brought from previous
incarnations --- all this, according to Buddha, forms an 'inner organ of
thought'. This organ of thought comprises the sum-total of what a man
thinks because certain experiences in former incarnations remain in his
Linga Sharira as a residue. Buddha saw in the inner being of man a kind
of inner organ of thought formed from Samskara, and he said: 'It is this
thought-substance that forms in man what is called his 'present
individuality' --- in Buddhism, 'Name and Form', or 'Kamarupa'.
'Ahamkara' is the term used in another philosophy.

Buddha spoke to his pupils somewhat as follows. In primeval times, when
men were still clairvoyant and beheld the world lying behind physical
existence, they all, in a certain sense, saw the same, for the objective
world is the same for everyone. But when the darkness of ignorance
spread over the world, each man brought with him individual capacities
which distinguished him from his fellows. This made him into a being
best described as having a particular form of soul. Each human being had
a name which distinguished him from another --- each had an 'Ahamkara'.
What is thus created in man\'s inner nature under the influence of what
he has brought with him from former incarnations and accounts for his
'Name and Form', his individuality --- this builds in him, from within
outwards, Manas and the five sense-organs, the so-called '*six organs*'.

Note well that Buddha did not say: 'The eye is merely formed from within
outwards'; but he said: 'Something that was in Linga Sharira and has
been brought over from previous stages of existence is membered into the
eye.' Hence the eye does not see with pure, unclouded vision; it would
look into the world of outer existence quite differently if it were not
inwardly permeated with the residue of earlier stages of existence.
Hence the ear does not hear with full clarity but everything is dimmed
by this residue. The result is that there is mingled into all things the
desire to see this or that, to hear this or that, to taste or perceive
in one way or another. Into everything man encounters in the present
cycle of existence there is insinuated what has remained from earlier
incarnations as 'desire'. If this element of desire were absent --- so
said Buddha --- man would look out into the world as a divine being; he
would let the world work upon him and no longer desire anything more
than is granted to him, nor wish his knowledge to exceed what was
bestowed upon him by the divine Powers; he would make no distinction
between himself and the outer world, but would feel himself membered
into it. He feels himself separated from the rest of the world only
because he craves for more and different enjoyment than the world
voluntarily offers him. This leads to the consciousness that he is
different from the world. If he were satisfied with what is in the
world, he would not distinguish himself from it; he would feel his own
existence continuing in the outer world. He would never experience what
is called 'contact' with the outer world, for, not being separate from
it, he could not come into 'contact' with it. The forming of the 'six
organs' was responsible for the gradual establishment of 'contact with
the outer world'; contact gave rise to *feeling* and feeling to the urge
to cling to the outer world. But it is because man tries to cling to the
outer world that pain, suffering, cares and afflictions arise.

This is what Buddha taught his pupils regarding the 'inner man' as the
cause of pain, suffering, cares and afflictions. It was a delicately
woven, sublime theory --- but a theory that sprang directly from life,
for an 'Enlightened One' had experienced it as a profound truth
concerning the humanity of his time. Having guided humanity as
Bodhisattva for thousands and thousands of years in accordance with the
principles of love and compassion, there dawned in him when he became
Buddha, knowledge of the true nature and the causes of suffering. He was
able to know why man suffers, and explained this to his intimate
disciples. And when his development was so advanced that he could
experience the very essence and meaning of human existence in the
present cycle of evolution, he summarized it all in the famous sermon at
Benares with which he inaugurated his work as Buddha. There he presented
in a popular form what he had previously communicated to his disciples
in a more intimate way.

He spoke somewhat as follows. --- Whoever knows the causes of human
existence, realizes that life, as it is, must be fraught with suffering.
The first teaching I have to give you concerns *suffering in the world*.
The second teaching concerns the *causes of suffering*. Wherein do these
causes lie? They lie in the fact that the thirst for existence
insinuates itself into man from what has remained in him from previous
incarnations. *Thirst for existence* is the cause of suffering. The
third teaching concerns the question: How is suffering eliminated from
the world? By eliminating its cause; by extinguishing the thirst for
existence proceeding from ignorance! Men have lost their former
clairvoyant knowledge, have become ignorant, and it is this ignorance
that conceals the spiritual world from them. Ignorance is to blame for
the thirst for existence and this in turn is the cause of suffering and
pain, cares and afflictions. Thirst for existence must disappear from
the world if suffering is to disappear. The old knowledge has passed
away from the world; men can no longer use the organs of the etheric
body. But a *new knowledge* is now possible, the knowledge acquired when
man immerses himself completely in what his *astral body*, thanks to its
deepest forces, can give him, and with the help of what his outer
sense-organs enable him to observe in the external physical world. What
is thus kindled in the deepest forces of the astral body and is
developed with the co-operation of the physical body --- although not
actually derived from it --- this alone can help man to begin with, and
give him knowledge; for this knowledge is at first bestowed upon him as
a gift. It was to this effect that Buddha spoke in his great inaugural
sermon.

He knew that he must transmit to humanity the kind of knowledge that is
attainable through the highest development of the forces of the astral
body. Hence he had to teach that through deep and penetrating
understanding of the forces of the astral body, man acquires knowledge
that is both appropriate and possible for him but is at the same time
untouched by influences from earlier incarnations. Buddha wished to
impart to men a kind of knowledge that has nothing to do with what
slumbers in the darkness of ignorance within the human soul as Samskara.
Such knowledge is acquired by waking to life all the forces contained in
the astral body in one incarnation. 'The cause of suffering in the
world' --- so said Buddha --- 'is that something of which man knows
nothing has remained behind from earlier incarnations. This legacy from
earlier incarnations is the cause of man\'s ignorance concerning the
world; it is the cause of his suffering and pain. But when he becomes
conscious of the nature of the forces in his astral body, he can, if he
so will, acquire a knowledge that has remained independent of all
influences from earlier times --- a knowledge that is his very own!'

This was the knowledge that the great Buddha wished to impart to men,
and he did so in the form of what is known as the 'Eightfold Path'.
There he indicates the capacities and qualities which man must develop
in order to attain, in the present cycle of human evolution, knowledge
that is uninfluenced by the ever-recurring births. Thus by the power he
had himself acquired, Buddha raised his soul to the heights attainable
by means of the strongest forces of the astral body, and in the
'Eightfold Path' he showed humanity the way to a kind of knowledge
uninfluenced by Samskara. He described the path as follows. ---

Man attains this kind of knowledge about the world when he acquires a
*right view* of things, a view that has nothing to do with sympathy or
antipathy or preference of any sort. He must strive as best he can to
acquire the right view of each thing, purely according to what presents
itself to him outwardly. That is the first principle: the *right view*
of things. Secondly, man must become independent of what has remained
from earlier incarnations; he must also endeavour to judge in accordance
with his right view of a thing and not be swayed by any other
influences. Thus *right judgment* is the second principle. The third is
that he must strive to give true expression to what he desires to
communicate to the world, having first acquired the right view and right
judgment of it; not only his words but every manifestation of his being
must express his own right view --- that and that alone. This is *right
speech*. The fourth principle is that man must strive to act, not
according to his sympathies and antipathies, not according to the dark
forces of Samskara within him, but in such a way that he lets his right
view, right judgment and right speech become *deed*. This is *right
action*. The fifth principle, enabling a man to liberate himself from
what is within him, is that he should acquire the right vocation and
station in the world. We may best understand what Buddha meant by this,
if we remember how many people are dissatisfied with the tasks devolving
upon them, believing that some other position would be more
advantageous. But a man should be able to derive from the situation into
which he is born or into which fate has placed him, the best that is
possible, i.e. to acquire the right 'occupation' or 'vocation'. Whoever
finds no satisfaction in the situation in which he is placed, will not
be able to derive from it the power to unfold right activity in the
world. This is what Buddha called *right vocation*. The sixth principle
is that a man should make increasing efforts to ensure that what he
acquires through right views, right judgment and so forth, shall become
*habit* in him. He is born into the world with certain habits. A child
gives evidence of this or that inclination or habit. But man\'s
endeavours should be directed, not towards retaining the habits,
proceeding from Samskara but towards acquiring those that gradually
become his own as the result of right views, right judgment, right
speech, and so on. These are the *right habits*. The seventh principle
is that a man should bring order into his life through not invariably
forgetting yesterday when he has to act to-day. He would never
accomplish anything if he had to learn his skills anew each time. He
must strive to develop recollectedness, mindfulness, regarding
everything in his life. He must always turn to account what he has
already learnt, he must link the present with the past. Thus along the
Eightfold Path man must acquire *right mindfulness* in the sense of
Buddha\'s teaching. The eighth quality is acquired when, without
partiality for one view or another and without being influenced by any
element remaining in him from former incarnations, he surrenders himself
with pure devotion to the things of the world, immerses himself in them
and lets them alone speak to him. This is *right contemplation*.

This is the Eightfold Path, of which Buddha said to his disciples that
if followed it would gradually lead to the extinction of the thirst for
existence with its attendant suffering, and impart to the soul something
that brings liberation from elements enslaving it from past lives.

We have now been able to grasp something of the spirit and origin of
Buddhism. We know too what significance lies in the fact that the
Bodhisattva of old became Buddha. The Bodhisattva had always allowed
everything connected with his mission to flow into humanity. In very
ancient times, before Buddha came into the world, men were not able to
apply even their inner forces in such a way that they themselves could
have developed the attributes of the Eightfold Path. Influences flowing
from the spiritual world were necessary to make this possible, and it
was the Bodhisattva of old who enabled these influences to stream down
upon mankind. It was therefore an event of unique significance when this
Bodhisattva became Buddha and now gave forth in the form of teaching
what in earlier times he had caused to flow down upon men from above. He
had now brought into the world a physical body able to unfold *out of
itself*, forces that formerly could flow down from higher realms only.
The *first body* of this kind was brought into the world by Gautama
Buddha. Everything he had formerly caused to flow down from above became
reality in the physical world at that time. It is a happening of great
and far-reaching importance for the whole of Earth evolution when forces
that have streamed down upon humanity from epoch to epoch are present
one day in the bodily nature of a human being on Earth. *A power that
can pass over into all men is then engendered*.

In the body of Gautama Buddha lie the causes enabling men in all ages to
develop in their own being the powers of the Eightfold Path. Buddha\'s
existence ensured for men the possibility of right thinking! And
whatever comes to pass in the future in this respect, until the
principles of the Eightfold Path become reality in the whole of mankind,
will all be thanks to that existence. What Buddha bore within himself he
surrendered to men for their spiritual nourishment.

Generally speaking, no science to-day perceives these significant facts
in the evolution of humanity, but they are often presented in simple
fairy-tales and legends. I have emphasized more than once that
fairy-tales and legends are often wiser and more truly 'scientific' than
our objective science itself. In its depths the human soul has always
sensed a certain truth connected with the nature of a Being such as a
Bodhisattva: that, to begin with, something streams down from above,
then becomes by degrees a possession of the soul and thereafter rays
back again into the cosmos from the soul itself. Men who were able to
feel the significance of this either dimly or clearly said to
themselves: like the rays of the sun from the heavens, so did the
Bodhisattva once ray down upon the Earth the forces of the doctrine of
compassion and love, the forces developed through the principles of the
Eightfold Path. But then the Bodhisattva descended into a human body and
surrendered to men the power that was once his own possession. This
power now lives in humanity and streams back into the cosmos as the rays
of the sun are reflected back in the moon\'s light. This was felt to be
of special significance in regions where it was customary to express
such a truth in the form of a fairy-tale or legend. Thus the following
remarkable legend was narrated in the regions where the Bodhisattva
appeared.

Once upon a time the Buddha lived as a hare. It was an age when other
creatures of many different species were looking for food, but it had
all been consumed. The plant food which the hare itself could eat was
not suitable for carnivorous creatures. The hare, who was in reality the
Buddha, saw a Brahman passing by and resolved to sacrifice himself in
order to provide food. At that moment the God appeared and saw the noble
deed. A chasm opened and swallowed the hare. Then the God took a
tincture and drew the picture of the hare on the moon. And since that
time the picture of Buddha as the hare is to be seen on the face of the
moon. In the West we do not speak of the 'hare in the moon' but of the
'man in the moon'.

A Kalmuck fairy-tale expresses this still more cogently. In the moon
lives a hare; it came there because once upon a time the Buddha
sacrificed himself and the Earth-Spirit drew the picture of the hare on
the moon. This expresses the great truth of the Bodhisattva becoming
Buddha and sacrificing the substance of his very being to mankind for
nourishment, so that his forces now ray out into the world from the
hearts of men.

Of a Being such as the Bodhisattva who became Buddha, we said --- and
this is the teaching of all who know: When a Being passes through this
stage he has had his last incarnation on the Earth, for his whole nature
is contained within a human body. Such a Being never again incarnates in
this sense. Hence when the Buddha became aware of the significance of
his present existence, he could say: 'This is my last incarnation; I
shall not again incarnate on the Earth!' --- It would however be
erroneous to think that such a Being then withdraws altogether from
Earth-existence. True, he does not enter directly into a physical body
but he assumes another body --- of an astral or etheric nature --- and
so continues to send his influences into the world. The way in which
such a Being who has passed through the last incarnation belonging to
his own destiny continues to work in the world, may be understood by
thinking of the following facts.

An ordinary human being, consisting of physical body, etheric body,
astral body and Ego, can be permeated by such a Being. It is possible
for a Being of this rank, who no longer descends into a physical body
but still has an astral body, to be membered into the astral body of
another human being. This man may well become a personality of
importance, for the forces of a Being who has already passed through his
last incarnation on the Earth are now working in him. Thus an astral
Being unites with the astral nature of some individual on the Earth.
Such a union may take place in a most complicated way. When the Buddha
appeared to the shepherds in the picture of the 'heavenly host', he was
not in a physical body but in an astral body. He had assumed a body in
which he could still send his influences to the Earth. Thus in the case
of a Being who has become a Buddha, we distinguish three bodies:

> 1\. The body he has before he attains Buddhahood, when he is still
> working from above as a Bodhisattva; it is a body that does not
> contain in itself all the powers at his command; he still lives in
> spiritual heights and is linked with his earlier mission as was the
> Bodhisattva before his mission became the Buddha\'s mission. As long
> as such a Being is living in a body of this nature, his body is called
> a '*Dharmakaya*';

> 2\. The body which such a Being builds as his own and through which he
> brings to expression, in the physical body, everything he has within
> him. This body is called the 'body of perfection', '*Sambhogakaya*'.

> 3\. The body which such a Being assumes, after he has passed through
> the stage of perfection and can work from above in the way described.
> This body is called a *Nirmanakaya*'.

We can therefore say that the 'Nirmanakaya' of Buddha appeared to the
shepherds in the picture of the angelic host. Buddha appeared in the
radiance of his Nirmanakaya and revealed himself in this way to the
shepherds. But he was to find further ways of working into the events in
Palestine at this crucial point of time.

To understand this we must briefly recall what is known to us from other
lectures about the nature of man. Spiritual science speaks of several
'births'. At what is called 'physical birth' the human being strips off,
as it were, the maternal physical sheath; at the seventh year he strips
off the etheric sheath which envelops him until the change of teeth just
as the maternal physical sheath enveloped him until physical birth. At
puberty --- about the fourteenth or fifteenth year in the modern epoch
--- the human being strips off the astral sheath that is around him
until then. It is not until the seventh year that the human etheric body
is born outwardly as a free body; the astral body is born at puberty,
when the outer astral sheath is cast off.

Let us now consider what it is that is discarded at puberty. In
Palestine and the neighbouring regions this point of time occurs
normally at about the twelfth year --- rather earlier than in lands
farther to the West. In the ordinary way this protective astral sheath
is cast off and given over to the outer astral world. In the case of the
child who descended from the priestly line of the House of David,
however, something different happened. At the age of twelve the astral
sheath was cast off but did not dissolve in the universal astral world.
Just as it was, as the protective astral sheath of the young boy, with
all the vitalising forces that had streamed into it between the change
of teeth and puberty, it now united with the Nirmanakaya of Buddha. The
spiritual body that had once appeared to the shepherds as the radiant
angelic host united with the astral sheath released from the
twelve-year-old Jesus, united with all the forces through which the
freshness of youth is maintained during the period between the second
dentition and puberty. The Nirmanakaya which shone upon the Nathan
Jesus-child from birth onwards united with the astral sheath detached
from this child at puberty; it became one with this sheath and was
thereby *rejuvenated*. Through this rejuvenation, what Buddha had
formerly given to the world could be manifest again in the Jesus-child.
Hence the boy was able to speak with all the simplicity of childhood
about the lofty teachings of compassion and love to which we have
referred to-day. When Jesus was found in the temple he was speaking in a
way that astonished those around him, because he was enveloped by the
Nirmanakaya of Buddha, refreshed as from a fountain of youth by the
boy\'s astral sheath.

These are facts which can become known to the spiritual investigator and
which the writer of the Gospel of Luke has indicated in the remarkable
scene when a sudden change came over the twelve-year-old Jesus in the
temple. We must grasp what it was that had happened and then we shall
understand why the boy no longer spoke as he had formerly been wont to
speak. It so happened that at this very time, King Kanisha of Tibet
summoned a Synod in India and proclaimed ancient Buddhism to be the
orthodox religion. But in the meantime Buddha himself had advanced! He
had absorbed the forces of the protective astral sheath of the
Jesus-child and was thereby able to speak in a new way to the hearts and
souls of men.

The Gospel of Luke contains Buddhism in a new form, as though springing
from a fountain of youth; hence it expresses the religion of compassion
and love in a form comprehensible to the simplest souls. We can read
what the writer of the Gospel of Luke has woven into the text of his
Gospel, but still more is contained in its depths. Only part of what
appertains to the scene of Jesus in the temple could be described to-day
and even greater depths of this mystery have still to be explained.
Light will then be shed upon the earlier as well as upon the later years
of the life of Jesus of Nazareth.
