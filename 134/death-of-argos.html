<p class="intro">As they spoke, a dog who was lying there lifted his head<br />
and pricked up his ears. It was Argos, Odysseus’ dog;<br />
he had trained him and brought him up as a puppy, but never<br />
hunted with him before he sailed off to Troy.<br />
In earlier times the young men had taken him out<br />
with them to hunt for wild goats and deer and hares,<br />
but he had grown old in his master’s absence, and now<br />
he lay abandoned on one of the heaps of mule<br />
and cattle dung that piled up outside the front gates<br />
until the farmhands could come by and cart it off<br />
to manure the fields. And so the dog Argos lay there,<br />
covered with ticks. As soon as he was aware<br />
of Odysseus, he wagged his tail and flattened his ears,<br />
but he lacked the strength to get up and go to his master.<br />
Odysseus wiped a tear away, turning aside<br />
to keep the swineherd from seeing it, and he said,<br />
“Eumaeus, it is surprising that such a dog,<br />
of such quality, should be lying here on a dunghill.<br />
He is a beauty, but I can’t tell if his looks<br />
were matched by his speed or if he was one of those pampered<br />
table dogs, which are kept around just for show.”</p>
<p>Then, in response to his words, Eumaeus, you said,<br />
“This is the dog of a man who died far away.<br />
If he were now what he used to be when Odysseus<br />
left and sailed off to Troy, you would be astonished<br />
at his power and speed. No animal could escape him<br />
in the deep forest once he began to track it.<br />
What an amazing nose he had! But misfortune<br />
has fallen upon him now that his master is dead<br />
in some far-distant land, and the women are all too thoughtless<br />
to take any care of him. Servants are always like that:<br />
when their masters aren’t right there to give them their orders,<br />
they slack off, get lazy, and no longer do an honest<br />
day’s work, for Zeus almighty takes half the good<br />
out of a man on the day he becomes a slave.”</p>
<p>With these words he entered the palace and went to the hall<br />
where the suitors were assembled at one of their banquets.<br />
And just then death came and darkened the eyes of Argos,<br />
who had seen Odysseus again after twenty years.</p>
