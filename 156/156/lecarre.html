T</b>he United              States has  entered one of its periods of historical
madness, but              this is  the worst I can remember: worse than McCarthyism,
worse than              the Bay of Pigs and in the long term potentially
more disastrous              than the Vietnam War.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reaction to 9/11 is beyond anything              
Osama bin Laden could have hoped for in his nastiest dreams.  As in     
        McCarthy times, the freedoms that have made the United  States the
             envy of the world are being systematically eroded.  The combination
             of compliant US media and vested corporate interests  is once
more              ensuring that a debate that should be ringing out  in every
town              square is confined to the loftier columns of the  East
Coast              press.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The imminent war was planned years before  bin Laden
             struck, but it was he who made it possible. Without  bin Laden,
the              Bush junta would still be trying to explain such  tricky
matters as              how it came to be elected in the first place;  Enron;
its shameless              favouring of the already-too-rich; its reckless
disregard for the              world&#8217;s poor, the ecology and a raft of unilaterally
abrogated              international treaties. They might also have to be
telling us why              they support Israel in its continuing disregard
for UN              resolutions.<br>
But bin Laden conveniently swept all that  under the              carpet.
The Bushies are riding high. Now 88 percent  of the              electorate
want the war, we are told. The US defence budget has been              raised
by another $60 billion to around $360 billion. A splendid new           
  generation of nuclear weapons is in the pipeline, so we can all       
      breathe easy. Quite what war 88 percent of the people think they are
             supporting is a lot less clear. A war for how long, please?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At              what cost in US lives?  At what cost to
the US taxpayer&#8217;s pocket? At              what cost &#8212; because  most of those
88 percent are thoroughly decent              and humane people  &#8212; in Iraqi
lives?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How Bush and his junta              succeeded  in deflecting
US anger from bin Laden to Saddam Hussein is              one  of the great
public relations conjuring tricks of history. But     they swung it. A recent
poll tells us that one in two persons in the              United States now
believe Saddam was responsible for the attack  on              the World
Trade Center. But the US public is not merely being               misled.
It is being browbeaten and kept in a state of ignorance  and            
 fear. The carefully orchestrated neurosis should carry Bush  and his   
          fellow conspirators nicely into the next election.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those who are              not with Bush  are against
him.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Worse, they are with the enemy.         Which is odd,
because I&#8217;m dead against Bush, but I would love to see               Saddam&#8217;s
downfall &#8212; just not on Bush&#8217;s terms and not by his methods.             
And not under the banner of such outrageous hypocrisy.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The              religious cant that will  send US troops
into battle is perhaps the              most sickening aspect  of this surreal
war-to-be. Bush has an              arm-lock on God. And God has very particular
political opinions. God              appointed the United States to save
the world in any way that suits              the US. God appointed Israel
to be the nexus of US Middle Eastern   policy, and anyone who wants to mess
with that idea is (a)  anti-Semitic, (b) anti-US, (c) with the enemy, and
(d) a              terrorist.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God also has pretty scary connections.  In the United
             States, where all men are equal in His sight, if not in one
             another&#8217;s, the Bush family numbers one president,  one ex-president,
             one ex-head of the CIA, the governor of Florida  and the ex-governor
             of Texas.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Care for a few pointers?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; George W. Bush, 1978-84:  senior  executive, Arbusto Energy/Bush
Exploration, an oil company;          1986-90: senior executive of the Harken
oil company.<br>
Dick Cheney,              1995-2000: chief  executive of the Halliburton
oil              company.<br>
Condoleezza Rice, 1991-2000: senior executive  with the              Chevron
oil company, which named an oil tanker after  her.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so              on. But none of these  trifling associations
affects the integrity of              God&#8217;s work.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1993, while ex-president George Bush  was visiting
             the ever-democratic Kingdom of Kuwait to receive  thanks for
             liberating them, somebody tried to kill him. The CIA believes
that              "somebody" was Saddam. Hence Bush Jr&#8217;s cry: "That man tried
to kill              my Daddy." But it&#8217;s still not personal, this war. It&#8217;s
still              necessary. It&#8217;s still God&#8217;s work. It&#8217;s still about bringing
freedom              and democracy to oppressed Iraqi people.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be a member of the              team  you must also
believe in Absolute Good and Absolute Evil, and   Bush, with a lot of help
from his friends, family and God, is there           to tell us which is
which.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What Bush won&#8217;t tell us is the truth              about
why we&#8217;re going to war. What is at stake is not an Axis  of             
Evil &#8212; but oil, money and people&#8217;s lives. Saddam&#8217;s misfortune  is to    
         sit on the second biggest oilfield in the world. Bush wants it,
and              who helps him get it will receive a piece of the cake. And
who              doesn&#8217;t, won&#8217;t.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Saddam didn&#8217;t have the oil, he could  torture
             his citizens to his heart&#8217;s content. Other leaders do  it every
day &#8212;              think Saudi Arabia, think Pakistan, think Turkey,  think
Syria, think              Egypt.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Baghdad represents no clear and present  danger to its
             neighbours, and none to the US or Britain. Saddam&#8217;s  weapons
of mass              destruction, if he&#8217;s still got them, will be  peanuts
by comparison              with the stuff Israel or the US could hurl at
him at five minutes&#8217;              notice. What is at stake is not an imminent
military or terrorist              threat, but the economic imperative of
US growth. What is at stake              is the US need to demonstrate its
military power to all of us &#8212; to              Europe and Russia and China, 
 and poor mad little North Korea, as              well as the Middle East; 
 to show who rules the United States at              home, and who is to
be  ruled by the US abroad.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The most              charitable interpretation  of Tony
Blair&#8217;s part in all this is that              he believed that, by  riding
the tiger, he could steer it. He can&#8217;t.              Instead, he gave  it
a phoney legitimacy, and a smooth voice. Now I              fear, the same
tiger has him penned into a corner, and he can&#8217;t get  out.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is utterly laughable that, at a time  when Blair has
             talked himself against the ropes, neither of Britain&#8217;s opposition
             leaders can lay a glove on him. But that&#8217;s Britain&#8217;s tragedy,
as it              is the US's: as our governments spin, lie and lose their
credibility,              the electorate simply shrugs and looks the other
way. Blair&#8217;s best              chance of personal survival must be that,
at the eleventh hour,              world protest and an improbably emboldened
UN will force Bush to put              his gun back in his holster unfired.
But what happens when the              world&#8217;s greatest cowboy rides back
into town without a tyrant&#8217;s head              to wave at the boys?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blair&#8217;s worst chance is that, with or              without
the UN, he will drag us into a war that, if the will  to              negotiate
energetically had ever been there, could have been               avoided;
a war that has been no more democratically debated in              Britain
than it has in the United States or at the UN. By doing so,             
Blair will have set back our relations with Europe and the Middle       
      East for decades to come. He will have helped to provoke          
   unforeseeable retaliation, great domestic unrest, and regional chaos 
            in the Middle East. Welcome to the party of the ethical foreign
             policy.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a middle way, but it&#8217;s a tough  one: Bush dives
             in without UN approval and Blair stays on the  bank. Goodbye
to the              special relationship.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I cringe when I hear my prime minister  lend         
    his head prefect&#8217;s sophistries to this colonialist adventure.  His  
           very real anxieties about terror are shared by all sane men.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What              he can&#8217;t explain is how  he reconciles
a global assault on al Qaeda              with a territorial  assault on
Iraq. We are in this war, if it takes              place, to secure  the
fig leaf of our special relationship, to grab              our share of the
oil pot, and because, after all the public              hand-holding in Washington
and Camp David, Blair has to show up at              the altar.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But will we win, Daddy?" <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, child. It              will  all be over while
you&#8217;re still in bed."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why?"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because              otherwise Bush&#8217;s  voters will get
terribly impatient and may decide              not to vote  for him."<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But will people be killed,     Daddy?"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nobody you know, darling. Just foreign  people."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can              I watch it on television?"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Only if Bush says you can."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"And              afterwards, will everything  be normal
again? Nobody will do anything              horrid any more?"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hush child, and go to sleep."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last Friday a              friend of mine  in California
drove to his local supermarket with a              sticker on his car saying:
"Peace is also Patriotic." It was gone by the time he&#8217;d finished shopping.<br>
