<h1>Death is not Proud</h1>

<p><em>Death be not proud, though some have called thee<br />
Mighty and dreadfull, for, thou art not so…</em><br />
John Donne</p>
      <br />

<main>
<p class="intro">“Everyone now living will be dead in 100 years.”</p>
<p>“Not necessarily so,” my interlocutor objects. “Modern technology
could change that…radically.”</p>
<p>“Do you mean it could eliminate death?”</p>
<p>“Anything’s possible.”</p>
<p>A third participant: “Anyway, who cares? If we’re dead we’re dead, no
problem.”</p>
<p>That was a real recent conversation about a subject which has baffled
humanity since we began thinking about it eons ago. Life, after all, is
a great mystery. From the moment it begins it marches inevitably towards
death. What, then, is the point?</p>
<p>I like Kierkegaard’s idea (paraphrased from memory): you come to a
fork in the road of life. One direction points to despair and suicide,
because life involves much suffering and, if it is meaningless, the
thinking person will want to end it as soon as possible. The other
direction points to faith. K reasons that the philosopher (thinking
person) must choose this path if only because the other path leads to
such a miserable end. K chose the path of faith – albeit outside the
Church – and it worked for him.</p>
<p>But the “thinking person” has changed his thinking today.</p>
<p>Kierkegaard never used the word “existentialism”, and would probably
be surprised to learn that he was its founder. For his existentialism
was very different from that of the modern existentialists – Sartre,
Camus et al. – who rejected the existential label, who were atheists and
decided that since we don’t know and will never know what the hell is
going on, why not just live , i.e., “exist” the best we can and be as
good as we can be. They more or less proved K wrong in that they were
able to live constructive lives (mostly), even after having chosen K’s
path to despair. Still, they were cultured people and possessed the
beauty and lyricism of culture. They could look at the great religious
art of the past and listen to the music of the spheres, thereby
nurturing their souls. Cheating, as it were.</p>
<p>So where do I (and you) come in? I was born into a Roman Catholic
family, the members of which didn’t think much about such existential
questions. My parents were young and their priorities were rising above
the working class and having a good time. (I don’t mean this critically,
they pampered me very nicely.) My father, though, must have had a thing
about the Church. I say that because he never went to mass and sent me
to public schools instead of Catholic ones. But I had to go to religious
instruction once a week at a Catholic school, a program designed for
such as I, endangered by a secular education. On one hand my father did
me a big favor by not subjecting me to daily brain washing; on the other
hand public schools were very inferior to the Catholic schools at that
time in Brooklyn. The proof of this is that when I applied to a Catholic
high school, my own decision because most of my friends were going
there, I didn’t make a high enough score on the entrance exam to be
accepted – and I knew I was smarter than many of those who were
accepted. (It just occurred to me that the real reason may have been
that I came from a public school and not, as the others, from a Catholic
one.) Whatever: again I was spared.</p>
<p>But not completely. A well-meaning aunt dragged me to mass every
Sunday when I was small and she and the nuns in religious instruction
had already imbued my poor little soul with guilt and fear, which are
the cornerstones of Catholic teaching – as well as that of other
Christian churches.</p>
<p>The first doubt I remember involved the Boy Scouts. There is (or was)
a holiday called Brooklyn Day in which the Boy Scout troops marched down
the main drags – in our case Ocean Avenue – waving the flags of Brooklyn
and, naturally, the United States. This holiday must have had something
to do with Protestantism, because one of the kids whose parents were
fanatical Catholics said we Catholic Scouts should ask Monsignor King
(God’s representative) if we were allowed to participate, just in case
it might offend God if we did. So he and another kid, his Sancho Panza,
asked Father King, who said no, we were not allowed to participate in
that march. I told my father, who told me to march if I wanted to and to
forget Father King. I marched, along with most of the rest of the Troop,
despite the squealer warning us that we’d go to hell if we did.</p>
<p>Then, a few years later, at mass one Sunday, the priest in his sermon
advised us that the new issue of the “index” of forbidden books would be
handed out at the door on leaving, that we should strictly obey it – in
order not to offend God and Jesus, who were one and the same. When I got
home I checked the Index, a long list or books, most of which I’d never
heard of, until I came to <em>The Three Musketeers</em>, which I’d just
finished reading. What? Why? Then it dawned on me: <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_Richelieu">Cardinal
Richelieu</a> was the bad guy. How dared Alexander Dumas accuse a
Cardinal of the Church, even fictionally, of being a power-hungry
lowlife? Even if he really was. I didn’t care much about that, though.
What bothered me was that the Church was banning books just because of
criticism.</p>
<p>Then there was Confession. As an adolescent I was a pretty adept
masturbater – if I remember correctly, and I do. Did I have the balls to
tell that representative of God, the smelly priest in his cubicle about
<em>that?</em> Actually no, I was too much ashamed and too much a
coward. I never went to Confession again, and only felt even more guilty
because of it. I would like to say that I questioned the whole system,
feeling that the priest had no more power to forgive sins than I did. Or
even if masturbating was a sin at all. (I was convinced it was.) But
that didn’t come until later.</p>
<p>Actually, I didn’t really free myself from the Church’s clutches
until I was about thirty years old and read a book by Rudolf Steiner –
the Philosophy of Freedom. Not that he criticizes the Church there much,
but because it’s really about Freedom with a capital F, and the Churches
don’t want us to have freedom – they want to tell us what we must think
and do.</p>
<p>Another book which was probably also on the Index is The Brothers
Karamazov, in which the chapter about <a
href="http://www.southerncrossreview.org/46/inquisitor.htm">The Grand
Inquisitor</a> took my breath away. It tells, fictionally, what would
happen if Christ came back. He would be rejected by the Church because
he might say something contrary to its teachings – about freedom – and
man isn’t ready for that.</p>
<p>I was first initiated into the idea of reincarnation by W. Somerset
Maugham’s <em>The Razor’s Edge</em>. But there it is postulated from an
oriental viewpoint, which is fine for some, but not really my cup of
tea.</p>
<p>Reincarnation is intimately associated with the concept of karma, so
to illustrate how my karma got me where I am, I’ll tell the story
briefly and, I hope, not too boringly.</p>
<p>In 1962 I was working for an international airline association (IATA)
and was transferred from New York to Buenos Aires – the only one from
the company to be here, meaning no infrastructure or back-up, not even
an office, and the telephones seldom worked. Why me? Hard to answer,
except that I was in the right place at the right time when we needed
someone in Argentina. (karma 2) I didn’t speak Spanish and at first
wasn’t sure whether Buenos Aires was in Argentina or Brazil. But off I
went with my wife and three-year-old daughter.</p>
<p>Backtrack: I met my German first wife when I was in the U.S. Army in
Germany only seven years after the end of the war. Her aunt and uncle
were anthroposophists, something I’d never heard of. But, as they were
the only interesting people in my wife’s family, I conversed with them
fairly frequently. Except for the reincarnation part, I found <a
href="https://southerncrossreview.org/155/fts-anthroposophy-introduction.html">anthroposophy</a>
to be pretty weird. When we were transferred back to the States, they
presented me with a copy of Rudolf Steiner’s “An Outline of Occult
Science”. I tried to read it, but couldn’t make head nor tail of it, so
I stuffed it into my duffel bag and forgot about it. (karma 1)</p>
<p>Fast forward to Buenos Aires: When the uncle heard that we were in
Buenos Aires, he wrote (thinking of our daughter) that there was a
Rudolf Steiner Schule there. He even gave the address: Warnes 1330
Florida. We had only been in B.A. a couple of weeks and were finding it
hard to find a permanent residence on my then miserable salary. One day
I was wandering around the city (no office to go to) and found myself on
one of B.A.’s main drags: Florida Street, so decided to check out the
school. But when I got to 1000 Florida, I was facing the Rio de la
Plata. Deciding not to swim to 1300, I turned back to other
business.</p>
<p>After living for a month in a temporary apartment in downtown Buenos
Aires, we put an ad in one of the city’s German newspapers. There were
2: the <em>Freie Presse</em> (reactionary fascist), and the
<em>Argentinische Tageblatt</em> (liberal Jewish). We chose the latter.
The next day a guy named Pablo Rosenbaum called offering a chalet in the
suburb of Florida. Afterward he told me that his name was really Felix,
but the Argentine immigration official apparently didn’t like it, so
entered Pablo on his entrance document. When his grandfather immigrated
to Germany, the immigration guy had changed his real Polish family name
to Rosenbaum. So that was twice his family had been renamed by
anti-Semitic bureaucrats. Anyway, the house was just what we needed –
and it was in a mostly German speaking enclave, where the ex (sic)
-Nazis and the Jews seemed to be getting along.</p>
<p>Our next door neighbors, German Mennonites who had come to Argentina
from Russia via Germany and Paraguay, told us that there was a German
school a few blocks away. We checked it out and it was the Rudolf
Steiner Schule, which I had been looking for on Florida Street in the
city, and here it was in the town of Florida. You see, I was used to the
American house numbering, so the information I had: “Warnes 1330
Florida” – where “Warnes” meant nothing to me, but it was the name of
the street with the number after it in the town of Florida. (karma
3)</p>
<p>It was ideal because our daughter already spoke German, although I
was more interested in her retaining her English. So I thought: this is
okay for kindergarten, but primary school will be a bilingual
English-Spanish one – if we’re in Argentina that long. But after three
years of Waldorf kindergarten only an overly ambitious fool of a father
would want to take his child away from something so wonderful!</p>
<p>When my daughter was in the second grade a conflict exploded between
two groups of teachers. The school Board sided with group A, and our
teacher was in the minority group B. They fired her, right in the middle
of the school year. The parents objected strongly, we even tried to take
over the school in a General Meeting. That failed, so a dozen families
took our kids out and founded a new school with “our” teacher. As a ring
leader, I became president of the Board as well as moonlighting English
teacher – one hour a day before heading off to my day job. (karma 4)</p>
<p>In that position I was more of less obliged to find out what the hell
I was representing, so I dug out my copy of Occult Science, which was a
bad English translation, so I obtained the German original and waded
through that. It’s not an easy book, but at least I had a general idea
of what anthroposophy is: still weird, but, Waldorf education, which is
based on it, works, so there have been something I was missing. Then two
more, very different Steiner books fell into my hands: <a
href="http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA004/English/RSP1964/GA004_index.html">The
Philosophy of Freedom</a> (already mentioned) and Basic Issues of the
Social Question – which, years later, I wound up translating. Not at all
weird. It was hard to believe that they were written by the same person.
Conclusion: he wasn’t mad.</p>
<p>Later I was transferred to Switzerland, then Germany, where I
encountered some of the negative aspects of what happened after
Steiner’s death, then back to Argentina, where that school we founded
had grown exponentially. But trained teachers were in short supply, so I
co-founded the Waldorf Teachers Seminario.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">* * *</p>
<p>But enough ego-bio. The main point is that anthroposophy, Rudolf
Steiner’s teaching, had answered most of my questions, including the
purpose of life and death. It seemed that I already knew the essential
answers, only that they had been submerged in my unconscious and needed
a jolt to emerge – if only partially, like the proverbial tip of the
iceberg.</p>
<p>Am I an existentialist? In a way, yes. Kierkegaard wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the God-forsaken worldliness of earthly life shuts itself in
complacency, the confined air develops poison, the moment gets stuck and
stands still, the prospect is lost, a need is felt for a refreshing,
enlivening breeze to cleanse the air and dispel the poisonous vapors
lest we suffocate in worldliness. … Lovingly to hope all things is the
opposite of despairingly to hope nothing at all. Love hopes all things –
yet is never put to shame. To relate oneself expectantly to the
possibility of the good is to hope. To relate oneself expectantly to the
possibility of evil is to fear. By the decision to choose hope one
decides infinitely more than it seems, because it is an eternal
decision… <em>Works of Love</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center">* * *</p>
<p>Upon this writing I am 81 years old; therefore near death,
statistically at least, something I am eminently aware of because I have
no credit, nor could I get a new credit card if I wanted one. But
<em>you</em> are also near death, regardless of your age, as you have
been since birth. Old age is not the only cause; accidents, natural
disasters, illness or war could write FIN to your autobiography at any
moment. But if a spiritual world exists as well as the physical one,
something you cannot prove to others, but which you can feel within you,
then go for it, give it the air necessary to let it rise to your waking
consciousness. Death is not proud, sooner or later it takes us all,
equally. Better, then, to existentially <em>choose</em> to meet the
spiritual world on your own terms, that is, now.</p>
