<h3>Chapter 10</h3>

</header>

<main>
<p style="font-weight:bold;margin-bottom:2em">October 1971</p>
<p class="intro">The Spring holidays were reserved for my long overdue visit to the
<em>Vila da Fraternidade</em> in Londrina/Paraná. For four years
<em>saudade</em>-letters have been going back and forth, and now the
legendary figure <em>- a Rute do Jardim</em>, Ute of the kindergarten -
will appear in flesh and blood. On the one hand I am looking forward to
it; on the other I am thinking: will they be disappointed when the real
me stands before them, after having become idealized with time?</p>
<p>I packed two huge suitcases with all the presents accumulated over
four years in Germany as well as in Sao Paulo, bought my ticket, not for
the bus but for a narrow-gauge railway, second class (I wanted to arrive
as I had left Londrina then) and was seen off by Katerina. I remember
clearly the feeling I had as I rode four years ago through the gloomy,
endless outskirts of Sao Paulo and imagined how queer it must be for
people loaded down with belongings and a dozen children coming from the
northeast and hurled into such a confusingly enormous city and then
having to adapt to an industrialized society. The first stop for most of
them is the bus or train station, in which they find themselves among
the crowd wrapped in rags or lying on newspapers. The second stop for
many is a favela or sleeping places under bridges and underpasses.</p>
<p>I thought of this again as I rode slowly for over an hour through the
city’s outskirts. I took out my sleeping-bag, for it’s still quite cool
at night, and was thankful that the seats aren’t still made of wood as
they were in 1967. After a fifteen-hour ride though, I was so stiff that
I could barely lift myself from the seat. I dozed and was woken around
midnight by an excited argument. Although the light isn’t turned off at
night, a male passenger was bold enough to touch his neighbor’s thigh in
an unchaste manner, whereupon the incensed woman began to shriek. Two
parties formed immediately, one in defense of the woman, the other for
the man. Each inveighed loudly against the other, getting hotter and
hotter.</p>
<p>More and more passengers came up, not wanting to miss the show.
Suddenly there was respectful silence: <em>autoridade</em> approached in
the person of the conductor. Very serious, he listened to the witnesses,
wrote down addresses and finally handed down his decision: the lecher
had to leave the train. He was pushed out into the pitch-dark night at
the next god-forsaken stop. He stood on the platform cursing the
departing train. The next train would come on the following day. The
discussion continued for a long time. An old man spoke important words
about the seriousness of the situation, which had a comical effect,
especially as his eyeglasses were tied over his ear with a black
shoelace.</p>
<p>I dozed again until sunrise. With great composure the train left the
miles behind it, winding its way through the fields, stopping every
twenty miles or so. It seemed to me that there was less coffee planted
than previously and more useful things: beans, rice, corn, manioca, etc.
Perhaps the government’s measures to eliminate unproductive
coffee-plants was having effect after all. The train went so slowly and
in so many loops that it seemed to want to greet each field personally.
A trip like that is so nice because you can look at the landscape calmly
without having to worry about traffic, you take part in the general
conversation and drink a cafezinho now and then.</p>
<p>Finally, at about eight o’clock in the morning, we came to the
Paranápanema River, which separates the states of Sao Paulo and Paraná.
Happy cries went through the train: Paraná, Paraná! Three more hours and
I would be going past the Vila da Fraternidade and pulling into the
station accompanied by the familiar toots. I found it especially
exciting and moving this time, as though the train was announcing my
return to the whole city with its tooting.</p>
<p>I walked through the streets as though I had never left. Still the
same shops, the music store where we bought the records for the
quadrilla, the wool shop where we bought our cheap wool. Only the store
selling Macumba supplies, herbs and saints, was new. Then the end of the
asphalt, down on the <em>terra roxa</em> through the red-light district,
a right turn at the corner, past some wooden houses, then left down the
hill and there was the Vila da Fraternidade with “our” house standing
before me.</p>
<p>I knocked at Gelsa’s house and Uranio, who used to clean our school,
saw me at the same moment. He has grown, but is as funny as ever. He
recognized me immediately. <em>Ah, é a ut ! Demorou mas finalmente
chegou!</em> (Ah, it’s Ute. It took a long time but finally she came.)
An <em>abraço</em>, an embrace, and I was pushed into the store where a
crowd of people stood around and Gelsa’s mother was behind the counter.
Gelsa came running with her two-year-old Marcelo. A<em>braços</em>.</p>
<p>On the surface a lot has changed. The old barracks and the wooden
shed as well as the abandoned bus in which an Indian family lived have
all disappeared. There are many new houses with electricity and running
water and the streets are partly paved. A health-center of the
Prefecture operates in our old house. They do the same kind of work as
during the development aid times: fighting the parasitic diseases,
stool-examinations, etc., only with more people. Even my work with
children has found its successors. Three, sometime four women from the
prefecture care for some children. Their efforts, however, seems to be
limited to letting the children play on their own with wooden blocks and
then pushing the blocks together again with a huge broom – at least as
far as I could determine during the week I was there. Smartly dressed
young ladies, they mostly stand around watching the children.</p>
<p>Seu Esau was doing the same from a place in the shade – in front of
our ex-bicycle shed – playing “lady” with great intensity, with one eye
watching the children on swings. He hasn’t changed a bit, the same
help-seeking look, an eternal imitator of the higher placed. It is all
quite bureaucratic, orderly and risk-free, but without life and
enthusiasm. The main thing is that at the end of the day the list is
ready and entered in a thick book that reports on the activities of the
<em>recreacionistas</em>, play-time supervisors. It looked something
like this: ball-playing – aims at coordinating the limbs and encourages
sociability; building-blocks – encourages the imagination and
equilibrium, etc, etc. And every day the same trash and the same
warmed-over words. My skin crawled when I saw children who were too
young for me to know them, but who knew my name from hearing it. A
thousand things could be done with them, such as sawing their own
building-blocks, weaving on simple wooden frames, making games, etc.,
all that we used to do with the children and what I have learned in the
meantime. (Since 1975 things have improved somewhat; at least there are
now sports.)</p>
<p>I had the feeling that this house, with all its employees, was like
an island in the Vila without any radiation streaming out to the other
inhabitants. No one really knew who these people were, what they were
doing and what their names were. It’s strange to think that they are
Brazilians and we were the foreigners. Kaspar, Adolfo, Ute, Otto have
become unforgettable names. The entire Vila still vibrates with us.
<em>A vila ficou chata depois que voces sairam,</em> it has become dull
since you left. I was amazed at how deeply those two years are anchored
in the children; nothing, but absolutely nothing have they forgotten.
Tereza, Otalino, Vena and all the others could repeat word for word what
I had once said on some occasion or other. They remembered every detail
of the festivals, the outings, the sports-festival, the exhibition, the
secret visits to Koch-Weser’s Fazenda, our raids on the abandoned
fruit-farms, the wood gathering for the Sao Joao festival. All of it
still lived in them, as though it had been yesterday and not four years
ago. And whenever we reveled in nostalgia, it ended with the final
words: <em>mas agora é chato, nao tem quadrilla,</em> <em>nao tem
brincadeito,</em> (it’s so dull now, there is no quadrilla, there are no
games).</p>
<p>For those children, who now mostly work as house-maids or in
factories, those two years were a kind of golden childhood, full of the
joy of life and crackling with the spirit of adventure. Now they must
work, swallow their mistress’s insolence for a wage of 20 to 40 dollars
a month, or get up at five in the morning and fill honey bottles till
seven in the evening, or whatever other spirit-killing work they can
get. But no one is there now to undertake something occasionally with
them, organize a festival or encourage them in some other way.</p>
<p>Despite the separation which, for children, is a long time, we
haven’t become strangers to each other. They are as open and willing as
ever to tell me about their <em>namorados</em>,* noivos* (lovers,
boy-friends) etc., as they once were to report on their childish
experiences. Most are already engaged or on the verge of marriage. Even
little Dirce, whom I left as a spindly nine-year-old, who has shot up
but is even more spindly and angular, proudly told me of her forthcoming
marriage.</p>
<p>I used my time to visit everybody. I sat in the same chairs in the
same houses only with larger families now, sipped coffee like before,
listened to what had happened in the meantime, and felt very good. But
how much coffee I had to drink! And how often I ate beans and rice!
Sometimes I ate lunch three times and dinner twice, always beans and
rice. <em>Come a comida a casa</em>, eat here at home - I couldn’t
refuse. The first two days everyone said I was much thinner (and
prettier!) than four years ago. At the end of my stay they said I had
gotten fat in Germany. In reality this was the result of the six-day
stuffing in the Vila da Fraternidade.</p>
<p>Has life become better? I asked. <em>Que nada, ficou do mesmo
jeito.</em> No, not at all, it’s all the same. Or, nothing much has
changed, the Vila looks better, no more favela, but there is still not
work for everyone, at least not regular work. A maid still doesn’t earn
more than $20 a month, the legal minimum wage is $75. Sack-carriers earn
by sack carried and earn up to $400 depending on how fast they can run,
but only when there are sacks to carry. Gelsa’s husband was without work
and dragged himself around the house somewhat embarrassed. Otalino, as a
car painter, earns a kingly wage: almost $250, regularly, every month.
He told me proudly about his trade and, cavalier-like, lost no
opportunity to spoil <em>me</em>.</p>
<p>But life has changed, one just doesn’t notice it amidst the daily
monotony. After a four-year absence the difference was immediately
apparent to me: many children stream into the city and attend high
school, many more have finished primary school with a <em>diploma</em>.
The older siblings were left back sometime during their school time and
finally dropped out in order to earn some money. Their younger brothers
and sisters live in more orderly homes, do their homework on clean
tables and finish school faster. I was happy for each one who told me he
had learned a trade. And I was sad for each one of whom I heard that he
had gone back to the land, to the <em>roca</em> (planted land), where
there usually are no schools. In practice this means that at least
another generation will pass before there is any kind of chance in life.
Cido and his family also returned to the land.</p>
<p>In these four years Cido has an odyssey behind him. Unfortunately I
wasn’t able to see him, although he was advised by radio that I was
finally back in Brazil. Shortly after I left Londrina in 1967, Cido’s
family also moved, trading their house for a bar near Londrina. That
didn’t work, so they traded the bar for a combi, packed their worldly
goods and went to Sao Paulo. It must have been horrible: where to go in
that monster-city with a family of ten? Seu Pedro, the father, was
underway from morning till night in the combi transporting goods from
one end of the city to the other. After three months they packed their
things again and drove north, to Pernambuco, from where they had
migrated twenty years before. They had relatives there (even a son who
had been left behind with his grandparents because he was too small to
withstand the strain of the journey to Paraná). The relatives had a
piece of land from which now, suddenly, ten more people had to be fed. I
think it was this idea of a piece of land in his own homeland which
decided Cido’s father to turn his back on the “wealthy” south -
<em>saudade da minha terra</em>. Gelsa told me how the whole family
appeared again one day in Londrina looking so gaunt and miserable that
they were hardly recognizable. From Londrina they continued to Faxinal,
about 100 miles farther, where they traded the combi for a piece of land
in Marumbi, the end of the world.</p>
<p>I will visit them for Christmas.</p>
<p>Dona Jacinta, the macumbeira, glows with composure and peace, as
always. You feel calm just being near her. You sit on a rickety chair in
front of her house, say something now and then, listen, make automatic
slow movements. Haste gives way. And I believed her as a matter of
course when she said that she had been sure of seeing me again. <em>“E o
destino</em>”. So I went from house to house accompanied by Tereza who,
just as before, never left my side. It is still somehow nice in the
Vila, but the atmosphere that prevailed before, when something
interesting was always being prepared, is absent.</p>
<p>On Sunday I had to leave. I was so tired that I slept through almost
the whole ten-hour bus ride to Sao Paulo, but I was glad to have finally
been in Londrina again.</p>
