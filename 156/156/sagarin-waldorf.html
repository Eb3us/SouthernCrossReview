<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p class="intro">Waldorf education does not exist. It is not a “thing” and it cannot
necessarily be distinguished from good education anywhere. Because it
does not exist, it cannot be found in the boxes we call Waldorf schools.
To narrow its definition to identify it with schools named Waldorf or
Steiner schools, or to identify it with a particular curriculum or
technique is to reify Waldorf education in a way that may describe part
of what is but necessarily ignores what may also be. What we call
Waldorf education may perhaps be found in any school, or anywhere that
teachers teach and students learn. There is no characteristic or quality
that is unique to what we call Waldorf education that cannot potentially
be found somewhere else. Waldorf education, as an idea or set of ideas,
slips through the cracks of any structure erected to define it.</p>
<p>Just as Waldorf education has no definite boundaries, it also has no
definite origin. We may describe Waldorf education, for example, as
arising from the educational conceptions of Rudolf Steiner. But many
(most? all?) of these conceptions–for example, the idea that,
culturally at least, “ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny” (the
development of an individual mirrors in microcosm the development of the
species)–may be shown to be older than Steiner and therefore not to
originate with him. (Beyond inferences from Steiner’s work, the idea
that “the” Waldorf curriculum must include Norse myths in fourth grade
or Greek history in fifth grade–curricular practices common in Waldorf
schools–is difficult to discover. It’s not in well-known lecture cycles
that he gave on education, nor is it in <em>The Study of Man</em> and
its correlates, nor may it be found in Stockmeyer’s or Heydebrand’s
well-known descriptions of German Waldorf school curricula.) In
particular, for the United States, the writings of Ralph Waldo Emerson
contain in prototypical form many of Steiner’s ideas about
education.</p>
<p><strong>Emerson and the Waldorf Curriculum</strong></p>
<p>Emerson’s essay “<em>History</em>”, for example, presents an
encapsulated curriculum that mirrors closely the general curriculum of
many Waldorf schools. His language, too, mirrors Steiner’s in addressing
the intellectual and emotional maturation of one person as, in part, a
recapitulation of the intellectual and cultural developments to be found
in human history.</p>
<p>The following quotations from “History” demonstrate the
correspondence that Emerson finds between history and individual growth
and development. This evolution of ideas is presumably based on
knowledge of ancient cultures or at least exposure to them. Someone who
had never heard of the Greeks, nor been exposed to their cultural
influence even in a dilute or adulterated form, could not be expected in
ontogeny to recapitulate this aspect of a cultural phylogeny. On the
other hand, as Emerson implies at the end of the first two quotations,
the state of being Greek, in the sense of “the spiritual nature unfolded
in strict unity with the body,” may be universally human even for those
who do not name it by the same name as Emerson:</p>
<p><i>What is the foundation of that interest all men feel in Greek
history, letters, art and poetry, in all its periods from the Homeric
age down to the domestic life of the Athenians and Spartans, four or
five centuries later? What but this, that every man passes personally
through a Grecian period. The Grecian state is the era of the bodily
nature, the perfection of the senses—of the spiritual nature unfolded in
strict unity with the body.</i> (123)</p>
<p>In many Waldorf school fifth grades, when teachers claim students
have achieved a grace and harmony of body and spirit that will soon be
disrupted by the travails of puberty and adolescence, the class holds a
Greek “Olympiad,” competing for laurels in javelin, discus and running
races, striving as much for form and beauty as for victory. As well,
Greek myths make up a significant portion of the literature of the fifth
grade in many Waldorf schools.</p>
<p>The comparison between Emerson’s writings and Steiner’s is a study in
itself. One more example will suffice here. For both Steiner and
Emerson, the study of nature can guide and give meaning to personal
experience. Neither means by nature what we might call “environmental
studies,” although these would not be excluded; each means that symbolic
meaning may be found in the reflective examination of the world around
us.</p>
<p><i>It is essential that the secrets of Nature, the laws of life be
taught to the boy or girl, not in dry intellectual concepts, but as far
as possible in symbols. Parables of the spiritual connections of things
should be brought before the soul of the child in such a manner that
behind the parable he divines and feels, rather than grasps
intellectually, the underlying law on all existence. 'All that is
passing is but a parable,” must be the maxim guiding all our education
in this [elementary school] period.'</i> (Steiner, 1965, 33)</p>
<p>Here is Emerson on the same topic:</p>
<p><i>I can symbolize my thought by using the name of any creature, of any
fact, because every creature is man agent or patient. Tantalus means the
impossibility of drinking the waters of thought which are always
gleaming and waving within sight of the soul. ...Every animal of the
barn-yard, the field and the forest, of the earth and the waters that
are under the earth, has contrived to get a footing and to leave the
print of its features and form in some one or other of these upright,
heaven-facing speakers.</i> (127)</p>
<p>Steiner’s thinking is often prefigured in Emerson’s, but this is not
to say that they are the same. Toward the end of his essay
“<em>Education</em>”, Emerson (1966) tosses in a towel that Steiner held
onto like a bulldog: “I confess myself utterly at a loss in suggesting
particular reforms in our ways of teaching.” (225) Steiner, in concert
with Emil Molt and a host of others, set out to reform our ways of
teaching in a myriad of concrete ways. But, while broad and systematic,
few or none of these ways were as original as we might believe, nor were
they meant to be particular to some schools and not others.</p>
<p><strong>A Unique Method?</strong></p>
<p>Separate from the ideas in or behind Steiner’s conception of
education, we might describe Waldorf education as a particular method.
When we define method, however–and certainly in the case of Waldorf
education we are not talking about a collection of techniques or a bag
of tricks, but a method in a larger sense–we omit important elements of
Steiner’s thinking. As Michael Lipson, recent translator of Intuitive
Thinking as a Spiritual Path, put it, somewhat cryptically, Steiner’s
method is a “methodless method” that must be continually re-invented by
each teacher for each student in order to be valid (Private
communication, November 20, 1999). And if we use a more mundane
definition of method, and speak of a particular curriculum or set of
teaching techniques, Waldorf education still eludes capture. Schools
that are not Waldorf schools and teachers who are not Waldorf teachers
use, perhaps increasingly, techniques and conceptions of education
identical to those propounded by Steiner, even though many of these
teachers may never have heard Steiner’s name. “Looping,” in which one
teacher stays with a particular class for several years, and block
scheduling, in which one subject is studied intensively for a relatively
brief time, are two such techniques. While no other school of which I
know even approximates the curriculum found in a typical Waldorf school,
there is nothing to prevent such adoption.</p>
<p><strong>The Doctor Didn’t Say</strong></p>
<p>One step toward recognizing that there is no such thing as Waldorf
education is to realize that Rudolf Steiner himself rarely spoke or
wrote about Waldorf education. The annotated bibliography of his
collected works lists only a handful of references to
“Waldorfschulpaedagogik,” “Waldorf School pedagogy.” He did speak and
write at great length about education; how children grow and develop and
learn, and how teachers may teach them. Further, in his work, Steiner
claimed no particular originality. He did not see a discontinuity
between what came before him and his own work. In his seminal pamphlet,
The Education of the Child (1965), for example, Steiner quotes Jean Paul
approvingly and at length. The sense one gets reading Steiner’s work,
and this applies as well to his writings and lectures on matters other
than education, is that ideas, like apples, lead an objective existence,
and may be plucked by anyone. We might say that the “method” of Waldorf
education is to learn to pluck these apples for oneself, as student or
teacher, and not to rely on the authority of Rudolf Steiner to hand one
already-picked apples. The analogy holds in that we may no more reify
Waldorf education than we may divorce apples from the tree, sun, soil of
their birth. Ideas, like apples, exist in and arise out of a
context.</p>
<p><strong>Staking a Claim</strong></p>
<p>While I dispute the existence of “Waldorf” education, I do not
dispute the existence of a group of schools that have chosen to identify
themselves with the first Waldorf school in Stuttgart by calling
themselves Waldorf schools, or to identify themselves with statements
about education made by Rudolf Steiner by calling themselves Steiner
schools. These schools have had a life of their own for more than
seventy years in the United States, and have made a powerful claim on
the ideas lumped under the term “Waldorf education.”</p>
<p>I cannot define or describe Waldorf education well, but I can
investigate how others have defined or described it. I will begin
outside the United States to include some of what Steiner himself said
about what we now call Waldorf education. I will then focus on the
strategies that writers and teachers in the United States have used to
write about Waldorf education. (To see how Steiner’s conceptions of
education made their way from Germany and Switzerland to the United
States, see Ida Oberman’s study, 1999.  <a
href="http://southerncrossreview.org/59/oberman-waldorf.htm">http://southerncrossreview.org/59/oberman-waldorf.htm</a>
Not available, unfortunately, is a similar account of the influence of
British Waldorf schools and teachers on the United States. This is a
study waiting to be written.)</p>
<p><strong>Compromise</strong></p>
<p>Moreover, I should like to point out to you that the real aim and
object of our education is not to found as many schools as possible… but
our education concerns itself with methods of teaching, and it is
essentially a new way and art of education, so every teacher can bring
it into their work in whatever kind of school they happen to be...and I
have declared that the methods can be introduced into every situation
where someone has the good will to do it. (Steiner, R. The Roots of
Education, p. 30)</p>
<p>Some will acknowledge the validity of this passage but insist on a
distinction between those who employ a “compromised” version of
Steiner’s method (“Waldorf-inspired” schools or teachers) and “real”
Waldorf schools that have deliberately dedicated themselves to this
method. I maintain, however, that all manifestations of Rudolf Steiner’s
educational ideas are necessarily compromised. Schools that see
themselves as pure because they are independent of the potentially
corrupting influence of government money may be compared with schools,
like the Milwaukee Urban Waldorf School, a choice school within the
Milwaukee public school system, that have made overt compromises to meet
present requirements regarding the separation of church and state. (One
of these compromises has been to eliminate the word “God” from a verse
that children in the school say each morning.) The Milwaukee school’s
compromise is a deliberate choice made in order to facilitate other
educational objectives, especially the education of relatively poor
urban children. Independent (non-public) Waldorf schools, on the other
hand, have clearly chosen, if not so deliberately, not to serve poor and
near-poor students like those who attend the Milwaukee school. This
choice is also a compromise.</p>
<p><strong>Three of a Kind: Strategies and Descriptions</strong></p>
<p><strong>A First Strategy: Waldorf Schools ARE Waldorf
Education</strong></p>
<p>Existing descriptions of Waldorf education can be characterized
according to three strategies. The first and simplest is to let Waldorf
schools stand for a description; what goes on in Waldorf schools is
inferred to be, by definition, Waldorf education. Ida Oberman’s
otherwise excellent history, Fidelity and Flexibility in Waldorf
Education, 1919-1998, slips into this mode, examining the histories of
Waldorf schools in Germany and the United States, implying that these
add up to a larger history of Waldorf education. To further her
discussion she uses the concept of a “cultural field,” a metaphorical
container for Waldorf education. Just as the field is a metaphor, so too
is Waldorf education.</p>
<p>Stephen Talbott also uses this first strategy in an appendix to the
also otherwise excellent book The Future Does Not Compute. He asks,
“What is Waldorf Education?” and answers with a description of the
founding of the first school and a description of a generalized
curriculum. (424)</p>
<p>If Waldorf education were a consistent and prescribed method and
curriculum, these analogies might suffice–although their definition is
circular. But what goes on in Waldorf schools varies from place to place
and time to time. There is no single characteristic, in fact, without
which a Waldorf school cannot exist, nor that defines a school as a
Waldorf school. Mentally erase beeswax crayons, or a eurythmist, or even
the morning verse. A school without these items could still fulfill
Steiner’s wishes for the education of children, I believe. Waldorf
education simply cannot be seen as the accumulation or collection of
some (even infinite) number of defining characteristics. To indulge such
a fragmented view is to give credence to a reductionism that Waldorf
education stands against.</p>
<p><strong>A Second Strategy: Pigeonholes</strong></p>
<p>The second strategy is to pigeonhole Waldorf education according to
some cultural or historical characteristic that, while real enough
within a particular context, may not be necessary or sufficient to
describe something larger called Waldorf education. Waldorf education is
defined only partially if it is defined as a reform movement, for
example. To the extent that authors acknowledge the contingency of such
synecdochical definitions (definitions in which the part stands for the
whole), they may be serviceable, if incomplete.</p>
<p><strong>Henry Barnes and the Movement</strong></p>
<p>Henry Barnes, author and long-time history teacher and faculty
chairman at the Rudolf Steiner School in New York City, characterizes
Waldorf education as a particular movement: “As one of the most rapidly
growing yet least known independent, nonsectarian school movements in
the free world today, Rudolf Steiner or Waldorf education should be
brought to the attention of all serious students of education.” (323)
This may be true, but Waldorf education is only “independent” [of public
education in the United States] and only a “movement” in the here and
now.</p>
<p>Barnes writes, “This article will briefly outline the history of the
Waldorf movement and seek to give an introduction to the philosophy and
methods that underlie it.” (323) Philosophy and methods sound promising;
they may extend beyond consideration of Waldorf education as a movement.
For Barnes, the philosophy is based on two major principles or insights.
The primary or defining principle of Waldorf education is an image of
the human being:</p>
<p>Behind the Waldorf curriculum, its methods of instruction, and all
the many practical aspects one thinks of when one thinks of a Waldorf
school today stands the idea of man and of child development from which
they all spring. It is this idea that gives them meaning and, in the
end, is the basis on which the [Waldorf education] movement will have to
be evaluated and judged. (326)</p>
<p>To speak of the education of a child necessarily implies a concept of
what or who this child is. Historical examples abound, including Locke’s
“tabula rasa,” Rousseau’s good “natural man” Emile, Jonathan Edwards’
very different “natural man” in original sin, and Dewey’s concept of the
child in community. For Barnes, Waldorf schools attempt to educate
according to Rudolf Steiner’s image of a human being:</p>
<p>In Steiner’s view, the human being can never be fully understood in
terms of his heredity and the impact of his environment. Beyond them
lies the essential core of human individuality, which cannot be defined
in material terms. That central entity, the human ego, is perceived by
Steiner to be supersensible and eternal, revealing itself by reflection
in the personality who is active here in time and space. It is the
educator’s responsibility to help this personality to develop in such a
way that it can become a fitting vehicle through which the real ego can
express itself. (326)</p>
<p>Note that Barnes refers to “educators” in the last sentence quoted,
not to “Waldorf educators.” The virtual brand name “Waldorf” is a label
attached after Steiner, not by Steiner. The label “Waldorf” represents
an increasing objectification of ideas that were initially less defined
and therefore more open to play and experiment than they often seem.</p>
<p>The words “in Steiner’s view” and “perceived by Steiner” are almost
extraneous here. Steiner is certainly not the only nor the first person
to speak of a human being as more than the sum of genes and environment.
If he, and others who find the world this way, are correct, then
inferences regarding education follow not from authority but from a
perceived reality. Where reference to Steiner should be inserted in the
quotation above is in the last sentence. “[For Steiner,] it is the
educator’s responsibility…” Even here, Steiner is not unique, although
his lectures and writings certainly constitute the most thorough and
systematic approach to education from this perspective.</p>
<p>Barnes’ point is that the “supersensible and eternal” incarnate in
the world, according to Steiner, gradually and in a specific fashion.
Education, therefore, should be conducted in accordance with what is
known about this process of incarnation. Hence, the methods and
curricula derive from this view.</p>
<p>For Barnes, a second principle grows from the first; because the
human self is seen to incarnate over a period of years, education must
address this development, which is seen to occur in three broad stages
lasting roughly seven years each. (Many writers on Waldorf education
treat these as if they were universal, when Steiner himself made it
clear time and again that he was describing something that was
historically and culturally true, not true everywhere and for all time.)
The method and curriculum similarly derive from these principles, and
provide the particulars visible to any visitor to a Waldorf school,
including instructional materials and subject matter. These will likely
include relatively featureless rag dolls, beeswax crayons, watercolor
paints, colored chalk, stories of Christian saints, Norse and Greek
Myths, and any number of other things. But the rhetorical question still
begs, does any of these make a Waldorf school?</p>
<p>Barnes’s consideration of methods and philosophy extends his
definition beyond the merely synecdochical, but his discussion here
speaks best to education in general, not to “Waldorf” education.</p>
<p><strong>Oberman’s Objectification</strong></p>
<p>Ida Oberman’s history of Waldorf education also offers an objectified
view. For her, “Waldorf” is a “unique” “German” “progressive”
“alternative” “reform initiative” or “institution” which has “embedded”
in it “an ideology, a belief system called Anthroposophy.” All of these
descriptions may apply to “Waldorf education,” but each could change
radically without disturbing Steiner’s contributions to ways of
teaching.</p>
<p>Oberman locates sources for the curriculum of the first Waldorf
school in Steiner’s intellectual biography, but, having shown its
somewhat contingent nature, then treats it as an object to be relocated
wherever “Waldorf” roots. Oberman shows how different people—Hermann von
Baravalle, Marie Steiner and Ita Wegman—and different schools—the Rudolf
Steiner School in New York City, the Kimberton Waldorf School, and the
Sacramento Waldorf School—adopt different strategies (“purity,”
“accommodation,” and “evolution”), but not how curricula reflect their
origins in Steiner’s work and in the time and place of their
implementation.</p>
<p>Among the evidence for this point of view is Oberman’s insertion of
the bracketed qualifier “Waldorf” into a quotation in which it did not
formerly appear: “The faculty now active at the school have proven…their
willingness to continue this [Waldorf] work, which represents the
noblest of German cultural life for all to see.” (1999. Emil Molt and
Duke Fritz von Bothmer, p. 134) It is clear that Oberman sees the work
as “Waldorf” work, but this is her own objectification.</p>
<p><strong>A Third Strategy: School Functions</strong></p>
<p>A third strategy involves some function or group of functions that
Waldorf education performs (is claimed to perform). If the difficulty of
the last definition is that it is too narrow—what is does not define
what else may be—the difficulty of a functional definition is that it is
too broad. Good education of any kind will necessarily perform certain
functions that cannot simply be claimed for, let’s say, Waldorf
education. Waldorf teachers are not the only teachers to claim a
developmental view of their students, nor the only to find some aspects
of human individuality that cannot be attributed solely to the
interaction of heredity and the environment. Further, it does not appear
that there is some unique set of functions that only something called
Waldorf education performs.</p>
<p><strong>Eugene Schwartz’s Functionalism</strong></p>
<p>For Eugene Schwartz, Waldorf education is a method, based on the work
of Rudolf Steiner, who “begins with a qualitative intelligence that is
unitary and suggests that the task of education is to multiply it. If
[Howard] Gardner’s theory concerns itself with ‘multiple intelligences,’
then Steiner’s approach might be called ‘intelligent multiplicity.’”
(151)</p>
<p>Further, Schwartz describes Waldorf education as a “‘will first’
pedagogy” or “methodology” that aims to “educate the child in accordance
with principles that ask us to honor and work with the soul and
spiritual nature of the youngster.” (157) While this sounds vague, it is
only his introduction into a more specific examination of methods and
techniques that teachers may use.</p>
<p>As for setting these ideas in a context as large as that of Barnes or
Curran (see below), I don’t believe Schwartz sees this as a helpful
goal; his more immediately practical goal is to show how Waldorf
education can function to address the needs of children in a particular
place and time. That is, he is concerned with the “will” education of
children in wealthy industrialized countries.</p>
<p><strong>A Look at the Map</strong></p>
<p>Eugene Schwartz also approaches the function of Waldorf education by
analogy. Like a map, Schwartz posits, a curriculum can be understood on
three levels. The first, a global, geophysical map, remains valid for
centuries. For Schwartz, Steiner’s description of child development is
such a durable aspect of Waldorf education. Development itself may
change, but only slowly. School subjects—history, math, and so
forth—change more rapidly, and have been modified significantly over the
decades since Waldorf education began. These are akin to a political
map, which may change more rapidly. An up-to-date road map, however,
must “come alive every day.” The clear advantage of Schwartz’ analogy is
that it neatly allows for both relatively unchanging and continually
changing aspects of Waldorf education. One danger of this view, however,
is that agreement on the unchanging aspects of the map may be perceived
as dogma—unchanging and therefore unquestioned. The history of geology
shows, however, that while the earth appears to change slowly, our views
and interpretations of that change can be revised radically from one
year to the next. The notion that Waldorf education is a thing, however
immaterial, has developed so surreptitiously over the past decades that
we have not noticed the change. Our map has not changed much, perhaps,
but we may be in danger of mistaking the map for the thing itself.</p>
<p><strong>A Quality of Education</strong></p>
<p>Each of the strategies outlined above makes Waldorf education into a
thing, whether a material thing like a school, or an ideological thing
like a movement, or a mental thing like a function. Not all writers on
Waldorf education, however, resort to these three strategies. Those who
perceive Waldorf education not as a thing but as a quality of education
demonstrate a different possibility for description.</p>
<p><strong>Peter Curran on Waldorf Education</strong></p>
<p>Peter Curran, graduate of Bowdoin College and long-time history
teacher at The Waldorf School of Garden City, adopts a strategy similar
to Barnes’s in describing Waldorf education, but then ventilates it
immediately to include, potentially, all schools, not a particular
subset. Following his retirement in the late 1980s, Curran set down some
of his ideas about Waldorf schools. Particularly, he believed that there
were four “essentials,” “without which no school (by whatever name) is a
Waldorf School and with which any school is a Waldorf School.”</p>
<p>I. As each child’s consciousness matures, it recapitulates the
cultural epochs of all Mankind. Waldorf education agrees with Emerson
when he says that all children go through a Greek period and a Roman
period, etc. There is, then, a proper time and method for particular
subjects to be taught.<br />
II. Since no one destroys what one loves, reverence, awe and respect for
the Earth should be fostered. An inkling of the spirituality of the
Earth then comes into being.<br />
III. The qualitative, as well as the quantitative, in all things should
be equally developed.<br />
IV. Above all, Man is known as a spiritual as well as a physical
being.</p>
<p>Curran’s statement poses a realism to Barnes’s nominalism in that the
enactment of these principles does not depend on the presence or absence
of the name “Waldorf.”</p>
<p>Of Curran’s four principles, the first and last are potentially
controversial, while the middle two may be found in many classrooms and
schools. The first, the “ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny” statement, is
probably the least familiar to most educators, and it may be the most
dated, arising out of Aristotle’s “Great Chain of Being”. (See, for
example, Lovejoy, 1936 and 1964) Few, if any, schools other than Waldorf
schools today organize themselves around such a principle. Still, there
is nothing to prevent them doing so if they choose. (Nor, if Waldorf
schools found a different central metaphor, would they necessarily cease
to be good schools.)</p>
<p>Last, some contemporary interpretations of the anti-establishment of
religion clause of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution might
prevent Curran’s fourth principle from being overtly applied in public
schools, but the concept is hardly unique among independent schools.
Some Waldorf teachers may argue that principle four may be found in many
schools, but that Waldorf schools mean something different by “spirit”.
I’m not convinced of this however, and, in any event, it needn’t be
so.</p>
<p><strong>Douglas Sloan’s “Education of the Imagination”</strong></p>
<p>Douglas Sloan, retired Professor of History and Education at Teachers
College, NY, worked diligently through writing and teaching to present
an open-minded approach to Waldorf education. In Insight-Imagination, he
describes Waldorf education sensitively in his discussion of a larger
“education of the imagination.” (211)</p>
<p>Maurice Merleau-Ponty (1964) wrote of the “primacy of perception”:
“all consciousness is perceptual, even the consciousness of ourselves…
The perceived world is the always presupposed foundation of all
rationality, all value and all existence.” (13) For Sloan, the faculty
of “imagination” necessarily accompanies perception, without which we
would live in William James’ “buzzing, blooming confusion.” For Sloan,
imagination is not simply one faculty among others—empathy or cognition,
say–to be strengthened through an enhanced curriculum. Imagination is
the necessary wellspring of human experience of the world:</p>
<p>…it is only through imagination that we have any knowledge
whatsoever. …The imagination, the image-making power of the mind …shapes
our everyday perception of the world, for there is no perception
separate from interpretation. (140)</p>
<p>Similarly to Barnes, Sloan describes Waldorf education according to a
conception of educational stages. After briefly examining Piaget with
regard to stages, however, Sloan qualifies his statements: “Any
conception of educational stages must… stand constantly ready to be
reevaluated and revised in the light of new evidence from any field of
research….” (212) For Sloan, Waldorf education does not approach a
faith, nor was it created ready-made by Rudolf Steiner, to be preserved
in perpetuity like a Colonial reenactment. “Such a conception of
education must as a whole remain open and subject to revision….” (212)
Waldorf education is an evolving model of educational thinking, research
and practice, and must be created anew in each application if it is not
to devolve into prescription or dogma.</p>
<p><strong>Nancy Parsons Whittaker’s Open Door Policy</strong></p>
<p>Nancy Parsons Whittaker is a translator of Steiner’s work into
English and a founder and administrator of “www.bobnancy.com”, a website
devoted to Waldorf education. The paragraphs that follow do not set
forth a thing-like definition, but attempt to throw open the doors of a
somewhat cloistered “movement”:</p>
<p>I believe that the educational movement Steiner founded drifted very
far from its source the moment [the act of] founding schools became more
important than examining the quality of education the children were
receiving and working to really convey the approach to other teachers in
all manner of schools and situations. What we call “Waldorf Education”
has largely come to mean a set of curricula and specific ways of
introducing specific subject matter. This has nothing (in my opinion) to
do with the original intent, which was to convey the attitude, the
viewpoint toward the children and toward society (any society) with
which a teacher could fully meet the physical, mental and spiritual
needs of both the students and their community.</p>
<p>Any school is a Waldorf school if the intent of Steiner’s pedagogy is
being met within its halls. What was the intent? The intent was to offer
an education in a way that gave each child a fundamental, true
introduction into the foundation of his or her society while at the same
time enhancing that child’s ability to accurately perceive life around
him or her without damaging the child’s innate capacity to be
sensitively aware of the Creative Love behind the visible world
(whatever that capacity might have been, whether large, small or nearly
nonexistent—the teaching was not intended to train a student’s spiritual
vision, just not to damage what already existed). The education was not
intended to found schools separated from their society at large nor was
it intended to model a particular belief system.</p>
<p>These goals can be met in a wide variety of settings, with an
infinitely wide possibility of curricula, through the myriad
possibilities of human personality.</p>
<p><strong>A Necessary Lack of Definition</strong></p>
<p>I used to have a bumper sticker that read “Waldorf Education” on two
lines, “Waldorf” above and “Education” below. I returned to long-term
parking after a research trip to discover that someone had neatly sliced
off the word “Waldorf”, who knows why, leaving a narrow bumper sticker
that read simply: “Education”. I started to remove it but stopped. It’s
still on my car.</p>
<p>Those who aim deliberately not to objectify Waldorf education can
avoid the pitfalls of reification, synecdoche, or function. These
writers necessarily leave Waldorf education undefined, and characterize
it in refreshingly open terms. Waldorf education becomes not a thing,
not a kind or brand of education, but a quality of education. And
qualities, like colors, like the warmth of a heart, may expand
boundlessly.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Steiner relates the following anecdote about his time in the Waldorf
School: “Whenever I come to Stuttgart to visit and assist in the
guidance of the school, I ask the same question in each class, naturally
within the appropriate context and avoiding any possible tedium,
‘Children, do you love your teachers?’ You should hear and witness the
enthusiasm with which they call out in chorus, ‘Yes!’ This call to the
teachers to engender love within their pupils is all part of the
question of how the older generation should relate to the young.”
(1995)</p>
<p>We are all older than some and younger than others; we learn from
some and we teach others. If we foster the relationship Steiner
describes here, then we participate in an education that honors the
memory of Rudolf Steiner.</p>
