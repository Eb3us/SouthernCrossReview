<h3>Canto II</h3>
</header>

<main style="display:flex;flex-direction:column;align-items:center">
<div>
<p class="intropoem">I'd really like again to live<br />
Not this long, but longer still.<br />
Would I then have more to give<br />
With more to feel but weaker will?</p>
<p>There was a time in northern climes<br />
When I thought and felt and sought<br />
And willed, but failed in troubled times;<br />
And countless were the lies I bought.</p>
<p>Then in seasons southern born<br />
Fluttered the spirit's broken wing,<br />
Or was it an angel in female form<br />
Whose beauty made the cosmos sing?</p>
<p>When I ask myself what<br />
I'm doing here I shake my head.<br />
It's neither cold here nor hot,<br />
The feeling I have is one of dread.</p>
<p>For what if I'd traveled so long and far<br />
With little to show than a belly pot?<br />
Well, but I loved and went to war<br />
The war was won, the love was not.</p>
<p>You think it depends on what you choose.<br />
You better think again, baby<br />
And heed the Reincarnation Blues:<br />
Fate does the choosing, and I don't mean maybe.</p>
        <br />
<h3>Christ Comes to Skopelos</h3>
<p><img src="r-blues-christ.jpg" class="a" /></p>
<p class="intropoem">Christ consents to be called<br />
To Skopelos<br />
One Easter Sunday<br />
Several years before his year<br />
Two-thousand.</p>
<p>They'd been calling him continually<br />
In all their white-walled<br />
Icon-laden churches,<br />
Never expecting he'd hear their songs.</p>
<p>He heard but will come instead<br />
To a hill above the town<br />
Where a donkey grazes<br />
And cypresses stand in rows<br />
Like green flame.</p>
<p>No one will see him<br />
No one will hear him<br />
When Christ consents to be called<br />
To Skopelos<br />
One Easter Sunday still to come.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;color:#600">+</p>
<p>Christ came to Skopelos<br />
One Easter Sunday<br />
Several years beyond the year<br />
Two-thousand.</p>
<p>They'd been calling him relentlessly<br />
In all their white-walled<br />
Icon-laden churches,<br />
Never expecting he'd hear their chants.</p>
<p>He heard, but came instead<br />
To a hill above the town<br />
Where a donkey grazes still<br />
And cypresses stand in rows<br />
Like green flame.</p>
<p>No one saw him,<br />
No one heard him<br />
When Christ came to Skopelos<br />
One Easter Sunday not so long ago.</p>

<h3>The Three is One</h3>
<p><img src="r-blues-three.jpg" class="a" /></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;text-align: center;">Forward</p>
<p class="intropoem">Taking my son to the Collegium Musicum<br />
Is good for his musical future, no doubt;<br />
For me it has advantages, too:</p>
<p>The hour and forty minutes spent<br />
Waiting at the sunny outdoor cafe<br />
Give me a chance to think and watch.</p>
<p>The bow-tied black-vested waiter<br />
Brings my cafecito without<br />
being told - and sweet cookies.</p>
<p>The unkempt park across the street,<br />
The flower-printed tablecloths,<br />
Sunglasses in winter, women in jeans,</p>
<p>Trains passing (newly privatized),<br />
The kiosco "Revistas - Diarios",<br />
Men smoking, uninhibited here.</p>
<p>I light my pipe, puff blissfully,<br />
My thoughts contain the past, no<br />
Avoiding that, the future less</p>
<p>Suppressed. What's uppermost is now.<br />
If life is all and this is happiness,<br />
How on earth can death be less?</p>
<p>If life is all, then this is all<br />
And death is all, it follows.<br />
Such thoughts were once reserved</p>
<p>For the philosopher's dreary den,<br />
Here they stoop to invitations<br />
From cafe idlers, now and then.</p>
        <br />
<p style="font-weight: bold;text-align: center;"> The First Circle</p>
<p class="intropoem">A  &nbsp;young woman passes my table,<br />
pretty thing with long dark hair<br />
cut abruptly down her back,</p>
<p>Shoulder bag, jeans, enigmatic smile.<br />
Fifty years from now she'll ask<br />
why she did what she did</p>
<p>and wonder what's next on the agenda.<br />
She'll even know it'll soon be over.<br />
Maybe centuries on from now</p>
<p>She'll sit pensive at a cafe table,<br />
see me passing by and wonder<br />
who I am and we'll close a circle,</p>
<p>one of three.</p>
        <br />
<p style="font-weight: bold;text-align: center;">The Second Circle</p>
<p class="intropoem">A &nbsp;boy waits for the waiter to go<br />
Then darts through the noonday traffic.<br />
Black dilated eyes are fixed</p>
<p>On each patron, bare arm extends<br />
a stubby nail-bitten hand.<br />
The tanned man sees only the hand,</p>
<p>doesn't look up from his paper, shakes<br />
his leonine head: no, no.<br />
Two women in fur ignore</p>
<p>the hand, the eyes, the begging boy.<br />
He comes to me. I've read too<br />
that such as he are exploited by</p>
<p>their masters and giving makes it worse.<br />
I don't know, it may be true,<br />
but what is truth in ignorance?</p>
<p>I give him a peso anyway<br />
in case some day the roles reverse<br />
and I'll be he and he'll be me.</p>
<p>A circle is closed, the second of three.</p>
        <br />
<p style="font-weight: bold;text-align: center;">The Third Circle</p>
<p><img src="r-blues-circle.jpg" class="a" /></p>
<p class="intropoem">The earth is round, more or less,<br />
As are the heads on our shoulders.<br />
My coffee cup, from the bird's-eye view,</p>
<p>Is round and two-dimensional.<br />
The universe seems to have<br />
The shape of an infinite bubble.</p>
<p>Is this what makes the world go round?<br />
No, it's not enough, this observed,<br />
partly thought-out rotundity.</p>
<p>The unexpected blow, the theft,<br />
The unknown assassin's thrust,<br />
The smiling traitor's perfidious lie</p>
<p>All smudge the portrait's splendor.<br />
An imponderable upsets the equation:<br />
She rounds the corner and looks about</p>
<p>Like a lost child in a fairy fable<br />
She makes her way to my shaded table.<br />
And takes her place across from me,</p>
<p>For love is an ellipse and the three is one.</p>
