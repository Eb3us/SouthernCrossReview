<main>
<p class="intro">One time I picked up a hitchhiker who told me how interesting
South America was, and that I ought to go there. I complained
that the language is different, but he said just go ahead and learn it -
it’s no big problem. So I thought, that’s a good idea: I’ll go to South
America.</p>
<p>Cornell had some foreign language classes which followed a method
used during the war, in which small groups of about ten students and one
native speaker speak only the foreign language-nothing else. Since I was
a rather young-looking professor there at Cornell, I decided to take the
class as if I were a regular student. And since I didn’t know yet where
I was going to end up in South America, I decided to take Spanish,
because the great majority of the countries there speak Spanish.</p>
<p>So when it was time to register for the class, we were standing
outside, ready to go into the classroom, when this pneumatic blonde came
along. You know how once in a while you get this feeling, WOW? She
looked terrific. I said to myself, “Maybe she’s going to be in the
Spanish class - that’ll be great!” But no, she walked into the
Portuguese class. So I figured, What the hell - I might as well learn
Portuguese.</p>
<p>I started walking right after her when this Anglo-Saxon attitude that
I have said, “No, that’s not a good reason to decide which language to
speak.” So I went back and signed up for the Spanish class, to my utter
regret.</p>
<p>Some time later I was at a Physics Society meeting in New York, and I
found myself sitting next to Jaime Tiomno, from Brazil, and he asked,
“What are you going to do next summer?”</p>
<p>“I’m thinking of visiting South America.”</p>
<p>“Oh! Why don’t you come to Brazil? I’ll get a position for you at the
Center for Physical Research.”</p>
<p>So now I had to convert all that Spanish into Portuguese! I found a
Portuguese graduate student at Cornell, and twice a week he gave me
lessons, so I was able to alter what I had learned. On the plane to
Brazil I started out sitting next to a guy from Colombia who spoke only
Spanish: so I wouldn’t talk to him because I didn’t want to get confused
again. But sitting in front of me were two guys who were talking
Portuguese. I had never heard real Portuguese; I had only had this
teacher who had talked very slowly and clearly. So here are these two
guys talking a blue streak, <em>brrrrrrra-ta brrrrrrr-a-ta</em>, and I
can’t even hear the word for “I,” or the word for “the,” or
anything.</p>
<p>Finally, when we made a refueling stop in Trinidad, I went up to the
two fellas and said very slowly in Portuguese, or what I thought was
Portuguese, “Excuse me . . . can you understand . . . what I am saying
to you now?”</p>
<p>“<em>Pois não, porque não?</em>” ” Sure, why not?” they replied.</p>
<p>So I explained as best I could that I had been learning Portuguese
for some months now, but I had never heard it spoken in conversation,
and I was listening to them on the airplane, but couldn’t understand a
word they were saying.</p>
<p>“Oh,” they said with a laugh, “<em>Não e Portugues! E Ladão!
Judeo!</em>” What they were speaking was to Portuguese as Yiddish is to
German, so you can imagine a guy who’s been studying German sitting
behind two guys talking Yiddish, trying to figure out what’s the matter.
<em>E Ladão!</em> It’s obviously German, but it doesn’t work. He must
not have learned German very well. <em>Judeo!</em></p>
<p>When we got back on the plane, they pointed out another man who did
speak Portuguese, so I sat next to him. He had been studying
neurosurgery in Maryland, so it was very easy to talk with him - as long
as it was about <em>cirugia neural, o cerebreu</em>, and other such
“complicated” things. The long words are actually quite easy to
translate into Portuguese because the only difference is their endings:
“-tion” in English is “-ção” in Portuguese; “-ly” is “-mente,” and so
on. But when he looked out the window and said something simple, I was
lost: I couldn’t decipher “the sky is blue.”</p>
<p>I got off the plane in Recife (the Brazilian government was going to
pay the part from Recife to Rio) and was met by the father-in-law of
Cesar Lattes, who was the director of the Center for Physical Research
in Rio, his wife, and another man. As the men were off getting my
luggage, the lady started talking to me in Portuguese: “You speak
Portuguese? How nice! How was it that you learned Portuguese?”</p>
<p>I replied slowly, with great effort. “First, I started to learn
Spanish. . . then I discovered I was going to Brazil.</p>
<p>Now I wanted to say, “So, I learned Portuguese,” but I couldn’t think
of the word for “so.” I knew how to make BIG words, though, so I
finished the sentence like this: “<em>CONSEQUENTEMENTE, apprendi
Portugues!</em></p>
<p>When the two men came back with the baggage, she said, “Oh, he speaks
Portuguese! And with such wonderful words:
<em>CONSEQUENTEMENTE!</em>”</p>
<p>Then an announcement came over the loudspeaker. The flight to Rio was
canceled, and there wouldn’t be another one till next Tuesday - and I
had to be in Rio on Monday, at the latest.</p>
<p>I got all upset. “Maybe there’s a cargo plane. I’ll travel in a cargo
plane,” I said.</p>
<p>“Professor!” they said, “It’s really quite nice here in Recife. We’ll
show you around. Why don’t you relax - you’re in <em>Brazil</em>.”</p>
<p>That evening I went for a walk in town, and came upon a small crowd
of people standing around a great big rectangular hole in the road - it
had been dug for sewer pipes, or something - and there, sitting exactly
in the hole, was a car. It was marvelous: it fitted absolutely
perfectly, with its roof level with the road. The workmen hadn’t
bothered to put up any signs at the end of the day, and the guy had
simply driven into it. I noticed a difference: When <em>we’d</em> dig a
hole, there’d be all kinds of detour signs and flashing lights to
protect us. There, they dig the hole, and when they’re finished for the
day, they just leave.</p>
<p>Anyway, Recife <em>was</em> a nice town, and I <em>did</em> wait
until next Tuesday to fly to Rio.</p>
<p>When I got to Rio I met Cesar Lattes. The national TV network wanted
to make some pictures of our meeting, so they started filming, but
without any sound. The cameramen said, “Act as if you’re talking. Say
something - anything.”</p>
<p>So Lattes asked me, “Have you found a sleeping dictionary yet?”</p>
<p>That night, Brazilian TV audiences saw the director of the Center for
Physical Research welcome the Visiting Professor from t he United
States, but little did they know that the subject of their conversation
was finding a girl to spend the night with!</p>
<p>When I got to the center, we had to decide when I would give my
lectures - in the morning, or afternoon.</p>
<p>Lattes said, “The students prefer the afternoon.”</p>
<p>“So let’s have them in the afternoon.”</p>
<p>“But the beach is nice in the afternoon, so why don’t you give the
lectures in the morning, so you can enjoy the beach in the
afternoon.”</p>
<p>“But you said the students prefer to have them in the afternoon.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about that. Do what’s most convenient for you! Enjoy the
beach in the afternoon.”</p>
<p>So I learned how to look at life in a way that’s different from the
way it is where I come from. First, they weren’t in the same hurry that
I was. And second, if it’s better for you, never mind! So I gave the
lectures in the morning and enjoyed the beach in the afternoon. And had
I learned that lesson earlier, I would have learned Portuguese in the
first place, instead of Spanish.</p>
<p>I thought at first that I would give my lectures in English, but I
noticed something: When the students were explaining something to me in
Portuguese, I couldn’t understand it very well, even though I knew a
certain amount of Portuguese. It was not exactly clear to me whether
they had said “increase,” or “decrease,” or “not increase,” or “not
decrease,” or “decrease slowly.” But when they struggled with English,
they’d say “ahp” or “doon,” and I knew which way it was, even though the
pronunciation was lousy and the grammar was all screwed up. So I
realized that if I was going to talk to them and try to teach them, it
would be better for me to talk in Portuguese, poor as it was. It would
be easier for them to understand.</p>
<p>During that first time in Brazil, which lasted six weeks, I was
invited to give a talk at the Brazilian Academy of Sciences about some
work in quantum electrodynamics that I had just done. I thought I would
give the talk in Portuguese, and two students at the center said they
would help me with it. I began by writing out my talk in absolutely
lousy Portuguese. I wrote it myself, because if they had written it,
there would be too many words I didn’t know and couldn’t pronounce
correctly. So I wrote it, and they fixed up all the grammar, fixed up
the words and made it nice, but it was still at the level that I could
read easily and know more or less what I was saying. They practiced with
me to get the pronunciations absolutely right: the “de” should be in
between “deh” and “day” - it had to be just so.</p>
<p>I got to the Brazilian Academy of Sciences meeting, and the first
speaker, a chemist, got up and gave his talk - in English. Was he trying
to be polite, or what? I couldn’t understand what he was saying because
his pronunciation was so bad, but maybe everybody else had the same
accent so <em>they</em> could understand him; I don’t know. Then the
next guy gets up, and gives <em>his</em> talk in English!</p>
<p>When it was my turn, I got up and said, “I’m sorry; I hadn’t realized
that the official language of the Brazilian Academy of Sciences was
English, and therefore I did not prepare my talk in English. So please
excuse me, but I’m going to have to give it in Portuguese.”</p>
<p>So I read the thing, and everybody was very pleased with it.</p>
<p>The next guy to get up said, “Following the example of my colleague
from the United States, I also will give my talk in Portuguese.” So, for
all I know, I changed the tradition of what language is used in the
Brazilian Academy of Sciences.</p>
<p>Some years later, I met a man from Brazil who quoted to me the exact
sentences I had used at the beginning of my talk to the Academy. So
apparently it made quite an impression on them.</p>
<p>But the language was always difficult for me, and I kept working on
it all the time, reading the newspaper, and so on. I kept on giving my
lectures in Portuguese - what I call “Feynman’s Portuguese,” which I
knew couldn’t be the same as real Portuguese, because I could understand
what I was saying, while I couldn’t understand what the people in the
street were saying.</p>
<p>Because I liked it so much that first time in Brazil, I went again a
year later, this time for ten months. This time I lectured at the
University of Rio, which was supposed to pay me, but they never did, so
the center kept giving me the money I was supposed to get from the
university.</p>
<p>I finally ended up staying in a hotel right on the beach at
Copacabana, called the Miramar. For a while I had a room on the
thirteenth floor, where I could look out the window at the ocean and
watch the girls on the beach.</p>
<p>It turned out that this hotel was the one that the airline pilots and
the stewardesses from Pan American Airlines stayed at when they would
“lay over” - a term that always bothered me a little bit. Their rooms
were always on the fourth floor, and late at night there would often be
a certain amount of sheepish sneaking up and down in the elevator.</p>
<p>One time I went away for a few weeks on a trip, and when I came back
the manager told me he had to book my room to somebody else, since it
was the last available empty room, and that he had moved my stuff to a
new room.</p>
<p>It was a room right over the kitchen, that people usually didn’t stay
in very long. The manager must have figured that I was the only guy who
could see the advantages of that room sufficiently clearly that I would
tolerate the smells and not complain. I didn’t complain: It was on the
fourth floor, near the stewardesses. It saved a lot of problems.</p>
<p>The people from the airlines were somewhat bored with their lives,
strangely enough, and at night they would often go to bars to drink. I
liked them all, and in order to be sociable, I would go with them to the
bar to have a few drinks, several nights a week.</p>
<p>One day, about 3:30 in the afternoon, I was walking along the
sidewalk opposite the beach at Copacabana past a bar. I suddenly got
this treMENdous, strong feeling: “That’s <em>just</em> what I want;
that’ll fit just right. I’d just love to have a drink right now!”</p>
<p>I started to walk into the bar, and I suddenly thought to myself,
“Wait a minute! It’s the middle of the afternoon. There’s nobody here,
There’s no social reason to drink. Why do you have such a terribly
strong feeling that you <em>have</em> to have a drink?” - and I got
scared.</p>
<p>I never drank ever again, since then. I suppose I really wasn’t in
any danger, because I found it very easy to stop. But that strong
feeling that I didn’t understand frightened me. You see, I get such fun
out of <em>thinking</em> that I don’t want to destroy this most pleasant
machine that makes life such a big kick. It’s the same reason that,
later on, I was reluctant to try experiments with LSD in spite of my
curiosity about hallucinations.</p>
<p>Near the end of that year in Brazil I took one of the air hostesses -
a very lovely girl with braids - to the museum. As we went through the
Egyptian section, I found myself telling her things like, “The wings on
the sarcophagus mean such-and-such, and in these vases they used to put
the entrails, and around the corner there oughta be a so -and-so . . .”
and I thought to myself, “You know where you learned all that stuff?
From Mary Lou” - and I got lonely for her.</p>
<p>I met Mary Lou at Cornell and later, when I came to Pasadena, I found
that she had come to Westwood, nearby. I liked her for a while, but we
used to argue a bit; finally we decided it was hopeless, and we
separated. But after a year of taking out these air hostesses and not
really getting anywhere, I was frustrated. So when I was telling this
girl all these things, I thought Mary Lou really was quite wonderful,
and we shouldn’t have had all those arguments.</p>
<p>I wrote a letter to her and proposed. Somebody who’s wise could have
told me that was dangerous: When you’re away and you’ve got nothing but
paper, and you’re feeling lonely, you remember all the good things and
you can’t remember the reasons you had the arguments. And it didn’t work
out. The arguments started again right away, and the marriage lasted for
only two years.</p>
<p>There was a man at the U.S. Embassy who knew I liked samba music. I
think I told him that when I had been in Brazil the first time, I had
heard a samba band practicing in the street, and I wanted to learn more
about Brazilian music.</p>
<p>He said a small group, called a “regional”, practiced at his
apartment every week, and I could come over and listen to them play.</p>
<p>There were three or four people - one was the janitor from the
apartment house -and they played rather quiet music up in his apartment;
they had no other place to play. One guy had a tambourine that they
called a <em>pandeiro</em>, and another guy had a small guitar. I kept
hearing the beat of a drum somewhere, but there was no drum! Finally I
figured out that it was the tambourine, which the guy was playing in a
complicated way, twisting his wrist and hitting the skin with his thumb.
I found that interesting, and learned how to play the <em>pandeiro</em>,
more or less.</p>
<p>Then the season for Carnaval began to come around. That’s the season
when new music is presented. They don’t put out new music and records
all the time; they put them all out during Carnaval time, and it’s very
exciting.</p>
<p>It turned out that the janitor was the composer for a small samba
“school” - not a school in the sense of education, but in the sense of
fish - from Copacabana Beach, called <em>Farçantes de Copacabana</em>,
which means “Fakers from Copacabana,” which was just right for me, and
he invited me to be in it.</p>
<p>Now this samba school was a thing where guys from the
<em>favelas</em> - the poor sections of the city - would come down, and
meet behind a construction lot where some apartment houses were being
built, and practice the new music for the Carnaval.</p>
<p>I chose to play a thing called a “<em>frigideira</em>”, which is a
toy frying pan made of metal, about six inches in diameter, with a
little metal stick to beat it with. It’s an accompanying instrument
which makes a tinkly, rapid noise that goes with the main samba music
and rhythm and fills it out. So I tried to play this thing and
everything was going all right. We were practicing, the music was
roaring along and we were going like sixty, when all of a sudden the
head of the <em>batteria</em> section, a great big black man, yelled
out, “STOP! Hold it, hold it - wait a minute!” And everybody stopped.
“Something’s wrong with the frigideiras!” he boomed out. “<em>0
Americano, outra vez!</em>” (“The American again!”)</p>
<p>So I felt uncomfortable. I practiced all the time. I’d walk along the
beach holding two sticks that I had picked up, getting the twisty motion
of the wrists, practicing, practicing, practicing. I kept working on it,
but I always felt inferior, that I was some kind of trouble, and wasn’t
really up to it.</p>
<p>Well, it was getting closer to Carnaval time, and one evening there
was a conversation between the leader of the band and another guy, and
then the leader started coming around, picking people out: “You!” he
said to a trumpeter. “You!” he said to a singer. “You!” - and he pointed
to me. I figured we were finished. He said, “Go out in front!”</p>
<p>We went out to the front of the construction site - the five or six
of us - and there was an old Cadillac convertible, with its top down.
“Get in!” the leader said.</p>
<p>There wasn’t enough room for us all, so some of us had to sit up on
the back. I said to the guy next to me, “What’s he doing - is he putting
us out?”</p>
<p>“<em>Não sei, não sei.</em>” (“I don’t know.”)</p>
<p>We drove off way up high on a road which ended near the edge of a
cliff overlooking the sea. The car stopped and the leader said, “Get
out!” - and they walked us right up to the edge of the cliff!</p>
<p>And sure enough, he said, “Now line up! You first, you next, you
next! Start playing! Now march!”</p>
<p>We would have marched off the edge of the cliff - except for a steep
trail that went down. So our little group goes down the trail - the
trumpet, the singer, the guitar, the <em>pandeiro</em>, and the
<em>frigideira</em> - to an outdoor party in the woods. We weren’t
picked out because the leader wanted to get rid of us; he was sending us
to this private party that wanted some samba music! And afterwards he
collected money to pay for some costumes for our band.</p>
<p>After that I felt a little better, because I realized that when he
picked the <em>frigideira</em> player, he picked me!</p>
<p>Another thing happened to increase my confidence. Some time later, a
guy came from another samba school, in Leblon, a beach further on. He
wanted to join our school. The boss said, “Where’re you from?”</p>
<p>“Leblon.” “What do you play?”</p>
<p>“<em>Frigideira</em>.” “OK. Let me hear you play the
<em>frigideira</em> .”</p>
<p>So this guy picked up his <em>frigideira</em> and his metal stick and
. . . “<em>brrra-dup-dup; chick-a-chick.</em>” Gee whiz! It was
wonderful!</p>
<p>The boss said to him, “You go over there and stand next to <em>O
Americano</em>, and you’ll learn how to play the
<em>frigideira!</em>”</p>
<p>My theory is that it’s like a person who speaks French who comes to
America. At first they’re making all kinds of mistakes, and you can
hardly understand them. Then they keep on practicing until they speak
rather well, and you fin d there’s a delightful twist to their way of
speaking - their accent is rather nice, and you love to listen to it. So
I must have had some sort of accent playing the <em>frigideira</em> ,
because I couldn’t compete with those guys who had been playing it all
their lives; it must have been some kind of dumb accent. But whatever it
was, I became a rather successful <em>frigideira</em> player.</p>
<p>One day, shortly before Carnaval time, the leader of the samba school
said, “OK, we’re going to practice marching in the street.”</p>
<p>We all went out from the construction site to the street, and it was
full of traffic. The streets of Copacabana were always a big mess.
Believe it or not, there was a trolley line in which the trolley cars
went one way, and the automobiles went the other way. Here it was rush
hour in Copacabana, and we were going to march down the middle of
Avenida Atlantica.</p>
<p>I said to myself, “Jesus! The boss didn’t get a license, he didn’t OK
it with the police, he didn’t do anything. He’s decided we’re just going
to go out.”</p>
<p>So we started to go out into the street, and everybody, all around,
was excited. Some volunteers from a group of bystanders took a rope and
formed a big square around our band, so the pedestrians wouldn’t walk
through our lines. People started to lean out of the windows. Everybody
wanted to hear the new samba music. It was very exciting!</p>
<p>As soon as we started to march, I saw a policeman, way down at the
other end of the road. He looked, saw what was happening, and started
diverting traffic! Everything was informal. Nobody made any
arrangements, but it worked fine. The people were holding the ropes
around us, the policeman was diverting the traffic, the pedestrians were
crowded and the traffic was jammed, but we were going along great! We
walked down the street, around the corners, and all over the damn
Copacabana, at random!</p>
<p>Finally we ended up in a little square in front of the apartment
where the boss’s mother lived. We stood there in this place, playing,
and the guy’s mother, and aunt, and so on, came down. They had aprons
on; they had been working in the kitchen, and you could see their
excitement - they were almost crying. It was really nice to do that
human stuff. And all the people leaning out of the windows - that was
terrific! And I remembered the time I had been in Brazil before, and had
seen one of these samba bands - how I loved the music and nearly went
crazy over it - and now I was <em>in</em> it!</p>
<p>By the way, when we were marching around the streets of Copacabana
that day, I saw in a group on the sidewalk two young ladies from the
embassy. Next week I got a note from the embassy saying, “It’s a great
thing you are doing, yak, yak, yak . . .” as if my purpose was to
improve relations between the United States and Brazil! So it was a
“great” thing I was doing.</p>
<p>Well, in order to go to these rehearsals, I didn’t want to go dressed
in my regular clothes that I wore to the university. The people in the
band were very poor, and had only old, tattered clothes. So I put on an
old undershirt, some old pants, and so forth, so I wouldn’t look too
peculiar. But then I couldn’t walk out of my luxury hotel on Avenida
Atlantica in Copacabana Beach through the lobby. So I always took the
elevator down to the bottom and went out through the basement.</p>
<p>A short time before Carnaval, there was going to be a special
competition between the samba schools of the beaches - Copacabana,
Ipanema, and Leblon; there were three or four schools, and we were one.
We were going to march in costume down Avenida Atlantica. I felt a
little uncomfortable about marching in one of those fancy Carnaval
costumes, since I wasn’t a Brazilian. But we were supposed to be dressed
as Greeks, so I figured I’m as good a Greek as they are.</p>
<p>On the day of the competition, I was eating at the hotel restaurant,
and the head waiter, who had often seen me tapping on the table when
there was samba music playing, came over to me and said, “Mr. Feynman,
this evening there’s going to be something you will love! It’s tipico
Brasileiro -typical Brazilian: There’s going to be a march of the samba
schools right in front of the hotel! And the music is so good - you
<em>must</em> hear it.”</p>
<p>I said, “Well, I’m kind of busy tonight. I don’t know if I can make
it.”</p>
<p>“Oh! But you’d love it so much! You must not miss it! It’s <em>tipico
Brasileiro!</em>”</p>
<p>He was very insistent, and as I kept telling him I didn’t think I’d
be there to see it, he became disappointed.</p>
<p>That evening I put on my old clothes and went down through the
basement, as usual. We put on the costumes at the construction lot and
began marching down Avenida Atlantica, a hundred Brazilian Greeks in
paper costumes, and I was in the back, playing away on the
<em>frigideira</em>.</p>
<img class="a" src="carnival-brazil.jpg" />
<p>Big crowds were along both sides of the Avenida; everybody was
leaning out of the windows, and we were coming up to the Miramar Hotel,
where I was staying. People were standing on the tables and chairs, and
there were crowds and crowds of people. We were playing along, going
like sixty, as our band started to pass in front of the hotel. Suddenly
I saw one of the waiters shoot up in the air, pointing with his arm, and
through all this noise I can hear him scream, “0 PROFESSOR!” So the head
waiter found out why I wasn’t able to be there that evening to see the
competition - I was <em>in</em> it!</p>
<p>The next day I saw a lady I knew from meeting her on the beach all
the time, who had an apartment overlooking the Avenida. She had some
friends over to watch the parade of the samba schools, and when we went
by, one of her friends exclaimed, “Listen to that guy play the
<em>frigideira</em> - he is good!” I had succeeded. I got a kick out of
succeeding at something I wasn’t supposed to be able to do.</p>
<p>When the time came for Carnaval, not very many people from our school
showed up. There were some special costumes that were made just for the
occasion, but not enough people. Maybe they had the attitude that we
couldn’t win against the really big samba schools from the city; I don’t
know. I thought we were working day after day, practicing and marching
for the Carnaval, but when Carnaval came, a lot of the band didn’t show
up, and we didn’t compete very well. Even as we were marching around in
the street, some of the band wandered off. Funny result! I never did
understand it very well, but maybe the main excitement and fun was
trying to win the contest of the beaches, where most people felt their
level was. And we did win, by the way.</p>
<p>During that ten-month stay in Brazil I got interested in the energy
levels of the lighter nuclei. I worked out all the theory for it in my
hotel room, but I wanted to check how the data from the experiments
looked. This was new stuff that was being worked out up at the Kellogg
Laboratory by the experts at Caltech, so I made contact with them - the
timing was all arranged - by ham radio. I found an amateur radio
operator in Brazil, and about once a week I’d go over to his house. He’d
make contact with the ham radio operator in Pasadena, and then, because
there was something slightly illegal about it, he’d give me some call
letters and would say, “Now I’ll turn you over to WKWX, who’s sitting
next to me and would like to talk to you.”</p>
<p>So I’d say, “This is WKWX. Could you please tell me the spacing
between the certain levels in boron we talked about last week,” and so
on. I would use the data from the experiments to adjust my constants and
check whether I was on the right track.</p>
<p>The first guy went on vacation, but he gave me another amateur radio
operator to go to. This second guy was blind and operated his station.
They were both very nice, and the contact I had with Caltech by ham
radio was very effective and useful to me.</p>
<p>As for the physics itself, I worked out quite a good deal, and it was
sensible. It was worked out and verified by other people later. I
decided, though, that I had so many parameters that I had to adjust -
too much “phenomenological adjustment of constants” to make everything
fit - that I couldn’t be sure it was very useful. I wanted a rather
deeper understanding of the nuclei, and I was never quite convinced it
was very significant, so I never did anything with it.</p>
<p>In regard to education in Brazil, I had a very interesting
experience. I was teaching a group of students who would ultimately
become teachers, since at that time there were not many opportunities in
Brazil for a highly trained person in science. These students had
already had many courses, and this was to be their most advanced course
in electricity and magnetism - Maxwell’s equations, and so on.</p>
<p>The university was located in various office buildings throughout the
city, and the course I taught met in a building which overlooked the
hay.</p>
<p>I discovered a very strange phenomenon: I could ask a question, which
the students would answer immediately. But the next time I would ask the
question - the same subject, and the same question, as far as I could
tell - they couldn’t answer it at all! For instance, one time I was
talking about polarized light, and I gave them all some strips of
polaroid.</p>
<p>Polaroid passes only light whose electric vector is in a certain
direction, so I explained how you could tell which way the light is
polarized from whether the polaroid is dark or light.</p>
<p>We first took two strips of polaroid and rotated them until they let
the most light through. From doing that we could tell that the two
strips were now admitting light polarized in the same direction - what
passed through one piece of polaroid could also pass through the other.
But then I asked them how one could tell the <em>absolute</em> direction
of polarization, for a <em>single</em> piece of polaroid.</p>
<p>They hadn’t any idea.</p>
<p>I knew this took a certain amount of ingenuity, so I gave them a
hint: “Look at the light reflected from the bay outside.”</p>
<p>Nobody said anything.</p>
<p>Then I said, “Have you ever heard of Brewster’s Angle?”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir! Brewster’s Angle is the angle at which light reflected
from a medium with an index of refraction is completely polarized.”</p>
<p>“And which way is the light polarized when it’s reflected?”</p>
<p>“The light is polarized perpendicular to the plane of reflection,
sir.” Even now, I have to think about it; they knew it cold! They even
knew the tangent of the angle equals the index!</p>
<p>I said, “Well?”</p>
<p>Still nothing. They had just told me that light reflected from a
medium with an index, such as the bay outside, was polarized; they had
even told me which <em>way</em> it was polarized.</p>
<p>I said, “Look at the bay outside, through the polaroid. Now turn the
polaroid.”</p>
<p>“Ooh, it’s polarized!” they said.</p>
<p>After a lot of investigation, I finally figured out that the students
had memorized everything, but they didn’t know what anything meant. When
they heard “light that is reflected from a medium with an index,” they
didn’t know that it meant a material <em>such as water</em>. They didn’t
know that the “direction of the light” is the direction in which you see
something when you’re looking at it, and so on. Everything was entirely
memorized, yet nothing had been translated into meaningful words. So if
I asked, “What is Brewster’s Angle?” I’m going into the computer with
the right keywords. But if I say, “Look at the water,” nothing happens -
they don’t have anything under “Look at the water”!</p>
<p>Later I attended a lecture at the engineering school. The lecture
went like this, translated into English: “Two bodies . . . are
considered equivalent . . . if equal torques . . . will produce . . .
equal acceleration. Two bodies, are considered equivalent, if equal
torques, will produce equal acceleration.” The students were all sitting
there taking dictation, and when the professor repeated the sentence,
they checked it to make sure they wrote it down all right. Then they
wrote down the next sentence, and on and on. I was the only one who knew
the professor was talking about objects with the same moment of inertia,
and it was hard to figure out.</p>
<p>I didn’t see how they were going to learn anything from that. Here he
was talking about moments of inertia, but there was no discussion about
how hard it is to push a door open when you put heavy weights on the
outside, compared to when you put them near the hinge - nothing!</p>
<p>After the lecture, I talked to a student: “You take all those notes -
what do you do with them?”</p>
<p>“Oh, we study them,” he says. “We’ll have an exam.”</p>
<p>“What will the exam be like?”</p>
<p>“Very easy. I can tell you now one of the questions.” He looks at his
notebook and says, ” ‘When are two bodies equivalent?’ And the answer
is, ‘Two bodies are considered equivalent if equal torques will produce
equal acceleration.’ So, you see, they could pass the examinations, and
“learn” all this stuff, and not know anything at all, except what they
had memorized.</p>
<p>Then I went to an entrance exam for students coming into the
engineering school. It was an oral exam, and I was allowed to listen to
it. One of the students was absolutely super: He answered everything
nifty! The examiners asked him what diamagnetism was, and he answered it
perfectly. Then they asked, “When light comes at an angle through a
sheet of material with a certain thickness, and a certain index N, what
happens to the light?”</p>
<p>“It comes out parallel to itself, sir - displaced.”</p>
<p>“And how much is it displaced?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know, sir, but I can figure it out.” So he figured it out.
He was very good. But I had, by this time, my suspicions.</p>
<p>After the exam I went up to this bright young man, and explained to
him that I was from the United States, and that I wanted to ask him some
questions that would not affect the result of his examination in any
way. The first question I ask is, “Can you give me some example of a
diamagnetic substance?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>Then I asked, “If this book was made of glass, and I was looking at
something on the table through it, what would happen to the image if I
tilted the glass?”</p>
<p>“It would be deflected, sir, by twice the angle that you’ve turned
the book.”</p>
<p>I said, “You haven’t got it mixed up with a mirror, have you?”</p>
<p>“No, sir!”</p>
<p>He had just told me in the examination that the light would be
displaced, parallel to itself, and therefore the image would move over
to one side, but would not be turned by any angle. He had even figured
out how much it would be displaced, but he didn’t realize that a piece
of glass is a material with an index, and that his calculation had
applied to my question.</p>
<p>I taught a course at the engineering school on mathematical methods
in physics, in which I tried to show how to solve problems by trial and
error. It’s something that people don’t usually learn, so I began with
some simple examples of arithmetic to illustrate the method. I was
surprised that only about eight out of the eighty or so students turned
in the first assignment. So I gave a strong lecture about having to
actually try it, not just sit back and watch <em>me</em> do it.</p>
<p>After the lecture some students came up to me in a little delegation,
and told me that I didn’t understand the backgrounds that they have,
that they can study without doing the problems, that they have already
learned arithmetic, and that this stuff f was beneath them.</p>
<p>So I kept going with the class, and no matter how complicated or
obviously advanced the work was becoming, they were never handing a damn
thing in. Of course I realized what it was: They couldn’t <em>do</em>
it!</p>
<p>One other thing I could never get them to do was to ask questions.
Finally, a student explained it to me: “If I ask you a question during
the lecture, afterwards everybody will be telling me, ‘What are you
wasting our time for in the class? We’re trying to <em>learn</em>
something. And you’re stopping him by asking a question’.”</p>
<p>It was a kind of one-upmanship, where nobody knows what’s going on,
and they’d put the other one down as if they did know. They all fake
that they know, and if one student admits for a moment that something is
confusing by asking a question, the others take a high-handed attitude,
acting as if it’s not confusing at all, telling him that he’s wasting
their time.</p>
<p>I explained how useful it was to work together, to discuss the
questions, to talk it over, but they wouldn’t do that either, because
they would be losing face if they had to ask someone else. It was
pitiful! All the work they did, intelligent people, but they got
themselves into this funny state of mind, this strange kind of
self-propagating “education” which is meaningless, utterly
meaningless!</p>
<p>At the end of the academic year, the students asked me to give a talk
about my experiences of teaching in Brazil. At the talk there would be
not only students, but professors and government officials, so I made
them promise that I could say whatever I wanted. They said, “Sure. Of
course. It’s a free country.”</p>
<p>So I came in, carrying the elementary physics textbook that they used
in the first year of college. They thought this book was especially good
because it had different kinds of typeface - bold black for the most
important things to remember, lighter for less important things, and so
on.</p>
<p>Right away somebody said, “You’re not going to say anything bad about
the textbook, are you? The man who wrote it is here, and everybody
thinks it’s a good textbook.”</p>
<p>“You promised I could say whatever I wanted.”</p>
<p>The lecture hall was full. I started out by defining science as an
understanding of the behavior of nature. Then I asked, “What is a good
reason for teaching science? Of course, no country can consider itself
civilized unless . . . yak, yak, yak.” They were all sitting there
nodding, because I know that’s the way they think.</p>
<p>Then I say, “That, of course, is absurd, because why should we feel
we have to keep up with another country? We have to do it for a good
reason, a sensible reason; not just because other countries do.” Then I
talked about the utility of science, and its contribution to the
improvement of the human condition, and all that - I really teased them
a little bit.</p>
<p>Then I say, “The main purpose of my talk is to demonstrate to you
that <em>no</em> science is being taught in Brazil!”</p>
<p>I can see them stir, thinking, “What? No science? This is absolutely
crazy! We have all these classes.”</p>
<p>So I tell them that one of the first things to strike me when I came
to Brazil was to see elementary school kids in bookstores, buying
physics books. There are so many kids learning physics in Brazil,
beginning much earlier than kids do in the United States, that it’s
amazing you don’t find many physicists in Brazil - why is that? So many
kids are working so hard, and nothing comes of it.</p>
<p>Then I gave the analogy of a Greek scholar who loves the Greek
language, who knows that in his own country there aren’t many children
studying Greek. But he comes to another country, where he is delighted
to find everybody studying Greek - even the smaller kids in the
elementary schools. He goes to the examination of a student who is
coming to get his degree in Greek, and asks him, “What were Socrates’
ideas on the relationship between Truth and Beauty?” - and the student
can’t answer. Then he asks the student, What did Socrates say to Plato
in the Third Symposium?” the student lights up and goes,
“<em>Brrrrrrrrr-up</em>” - he tells you everything, word for word, that
Socrates said, in beautiful Greek.</p>
<p>But what Socrates was talking about in the Third Symposium was the
relationship between Truth and Beauty!</p>
<p>What this Greek scholar discovers is, the students in another country
learn Greek by first learning to pronounce the letters, then the words,
and then sentences and paragraphs. They can recite, word for word, what
Socrates said, without realizing that those Greek words actually mean
something. To the student they are all artificial sounds. Nobody has
ever translated them into words the students can understand.</p>
<p>I said, “That’s how it looks to me, when I see you teaching the kids
‘science’ here in Brazil.” (Big blast, right?)</p>
<p>Then I held up the elementary physics textbook they were using.
“There are no experimental results mentioned anywhere in this book,
except in one place where there is a ball, rolling down an inclined
plane, in which it says how far the ball got after one second, two
seconds, three seconds, and so on. The numbers have ‘errors’ in them -
that is, if you look at them, you think you’re looking at experimental
results, because the numbers are a little above, or a little below, the
theoretical values. The book even talks about having to correct the
experimental errors - very fine. The trouble is, when you calculate the
value of the acceleration constant from these values, you get the right
answer. But a ball rolling down an inclined plane, <em>if it is actually
done</em>, has an inertia to get it to turn, and will, <em>if you do the
experiment</em>, produce five-sevenths of the right answer, because of
the extra energy needed to go into the rotation of the ball. Therefore
this single example of experimental ‘results’ is obtained from a fake
experiment. Nobody had rolled such a ball, or they would never have
gotten those results!</p>
<p>“I have discovered something else,” I continued. “By flipping the
pages at random, and putting my finger in and reading the sentences on
that page, I can show you what’s the matter - how it’s not science, but
memorizing, in every circumstance. Therefore I am brave enough to flip
through the pages now, in front of this audience, to put my finger in,
to read, and to show you.”</p>
<p>So I did it. <em>Brrrrrrrup</em> - I stuck my finger in, and I
started to read: “Triboluminescence. Triboluminescence is the light
emitted when crystals are crushed..</p>
<p>I said, “And there, have you got science? No! You have only told what
a word means in terms of other words. You haven’t told anything about
nature-<em>what</em> crystals produce light when you crush them,
<em>why</em> they produce light. Did you see any student go home and
<em>try it</em>? He can’t.</p>
<p>“But if, instead, you were to write, ‘When you take a lump of sugar
and crush it with a pair of pliers in the dark, you can see a bluish
flash. Some other crystals do that too. Nobody knows why. The phenomenon
is called “triboluminescence.”’ Then someone will go home and try it.
Then there’s an experience of nature.” I used that example to show them,
but it didn’t make any difference where I would have put my finger in
the book; it was like that everywhere.</p>
<p>Finally, I said that I couldn’t see how anyone could he educated by
this self-propagating system in which people pass exams, and teach
others to pass exams, but nobody knows anything. “However,” I said, “I
must be wrong. There were two students in my class who did very well,
and one of the physicists I know was educated entirely in Brazil. Thus,
it must be possible for some people to work their way through the
system, bad as it is.”</p>
<p>Well, after I gave the talk, the head of the science education
department got up and said, “Mr. Feynman has told us some things that
are very hard for us to hear, but it appears to he that he really loves
science, and is sincere in his criticism. Therefore, I think we should
listen to him. I came here knowing we have some sickness in our system
of education; what I have learned is that we have a cancer!” - and he
sat down. ..That gave other people the freedom to speak out, and there
was a big excitement. Everybody was getting up and making suggestions.
The students got some committee together to mimeograph the lectures in
advance, and they got other committees organized to do this and
that.</p>
<p>Then something happened which was totally unexpected for me. One of
the students got up and said, “I’m one of the two students whom
Mr. Feynman referred to at the end of his talk. I was not educated in
Brazil; I was educated in Germany, and I’ve just come to Brazil this
year.”</p>
<p>The other student who had done well in class had a similar thing to
say. And the professor I had mentioned got up and said, “I was educated
here in Brazil during the war, when, fortunately, all of the professors
had left the university, so I learned everything by reading alone.
Therefore I was not really educated under the Brazilian system.”</p>
<p>I didn’t expect that. I knew the system was bad, but 100 percent - it
was terrible!</p>
<p>Since I had gone to Brazil under a program sponsored by the United
States Government, I was asked by the State Department to write a report
about my experiences in Brazil, so I wrote out the essentials of the
speech I had just given. I found out later through the grapevine that
the reaction of somebody in the State Department was, “That shows you
how dangerous it is to send somebody to Brazil who is so naive. Foolish
fellow; he can only cause trouble. He didn’t understand the problems.”
Quite the contrary! I think this person in the State Department was
naive to think that because he saw a university with a list of courses
and descriptions, that’s what it was.</p>

<p><strong><a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman">Richard Phillips
Feynman</a> (May 11, 1918 – February 15, 1988)</strong> was an American
physicist known for his work in the path integral formulation of quantum
mechanics, the theory of quantum electrodynamics and the physics of the
superfluidity of supercooled liquid helium, as well as in particle
physics (he proposed the parton model). For his contributions to the
development of quantum electrodynamics, Feynman, jointly with Julian
Schwinger and Sin-Itiro Tomonaga, received the Nobel Prize in Physics in
1965. He developed a widely used pictorial representation scheme for the
mathematical expressions governing the behavior of subatomic particles,
which later became known as Feynman diagrams. During his lifetime,
Feynman became one of the best-known scientists in the world. In a 1999
poll of 130 leading physicists worldwide by the British journal Physics
World he was ranked as one of the ten greatest physicists of all
time.</p>
