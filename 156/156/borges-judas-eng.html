<p class="intro">In Asia Minor or in Alexandria, in the second
century of our faith (when Basilides was announcing that the cosmos was
a rash and malevolent improvisation engineered by defective angels),
Nils Runeberg might have directed, with a singular intellectual passion,
one of the Gnostic monasteries. Dante would have destined him, perhaps,
for a fiery sepulcher; his name might have augmented the catalogues of
heresiarchs, between Satornibus and Carpocrates; some fragment of his
preaching, embellished with invective, might have been preserved in the
apocryphal <em>Liber adversus omnes haereses</em> or might have perished
when the firing of a monastic library consumed the last example of the
<em>Syntagma</em>. Instead, God assigned him to the twentieth century,
and to the university city of Lund. There, in 1904, he published the
first edition of <em>Kristus och Judas</em>; there, in 1909, his
masterpiece <em>Dem hemlige Frälsaren</em> appeared. (Of this last
mentioned work there exists a German version, <em>Der heimliche
Heiland</em>, published in 1912 by Emil Schering.)</p>
<p>Before undertaking an examination of the foregoing works, it is
necessary to repeat that Nils Runeberg, a member of the National
Evangelical Union, was deeply religious. In some salon in Paris, or even
in Buenos Aires, a literary person might well rediscover Runeberg’s
theses; but these arguments, presented in such a setting, would seem
like frivolous and idle exercises in irrelevance or blasphemy. To
Runeberg they were the key with which to decipher a central mystery of
theology; they were a matter of meditation and analysis, of historic and
philologic controversy, of loftiness, of jubilation, and of terror. They
justified, and destroyed, his life. Whoever peruses this essay should
know that it states only Runeberg’s conclusions, not his dialectic or
his proof. Someone may observe that no doubt the conclusion preceded the
“proofs”. For who gives himself up to looking for proofs of something he
does not believe in or the predication of which he does not care
about?</p>
<p>The first edition of <em>Kristus och Judas</em> bears the following
categorical epigraph, whose meaning, some years later, Nils Runeberg
himself would monstrously dilate:</p>
<p><strong>Not one thing, but everything tradition attributes to Judas
Iscariot is false.</strong></p>
<p>(De Quincey, 1857.)</p>
<p>Preceded in his speculation by some German thinker, De Quincey opined
that Judas had betrayed Jesus Christ in order to force him to declare
his divinity and thus set off a vast rebellion against the yoke of Rome;
Runeberg offers a metaphysical vindication. Skillfully, he begins by
pointing out how superfluous was the act of Judas. He observes (as did
Robertson) that in order to identify a master who daily preached in the
synagogue and who performed miracles before gatherings of thousands, the
treachery of an apostle is not necessary. This, nevertheless, occurred.
To suppose an error in Scripture is intolerable; no less intolerable is
it to admit that there was a single haphazard act in the most precious
drama in the history of the world. Ergo, the treachery of Judas was not
accidental; it was a predestined deed which has its mysterious place in
the economy of the Redemption. Runeberg continues: The Word, when It was
made flesh, passed from ubiquity into space, from eternity into history,
from blessedness without limit to mutation and death; in order to
correspond to such a sacrifice it was necessary that a man, as
representative of all men, make a suitable sacrifice. Judas Iscariot was
that man. Judas, alone among the apostles, intuited the secret divinity
and the terrible purpose of Jesus. The Word had lowered Himself to be
mortal; Judas, the disciple of the Word, could lower himself to the role
of informer (the worst transgression dishonor abides), and welcome the
fire which can not be extinguished. The lower order is a mirror of the
superior order, the forms of the earth correspond to the forms of the
heavens; the stains on the skin are a map of the incorruptible
constellations; Judas in some way reflects Jesus. Thus the thirty pieces
of silver and the kiss; thus deliberate self-destruction, in order to
deserve damnation all the more. In this manner did Nils Runeberg
elucidate the enigma of Judas.</p>
<p>The theologians of all the confessions refuted him. Lars Peter
Engström accused him of ignoring, or of confining to the past, the
hypostatic union of the Divine Trinity; Axel Borelius charged him with
renewing the heresy of the Docetists, who denied the humanity of Jesus;
the sharp tongued bishop of Lund denounced him for contradicting the
third verse of chapter twenty-two of the Gospel of St.
Luke.</p>

<p>These various anathemas influenced Runeberg, who partially rewrote
the disapproved book and modified his doctrine. He abandoned the terrain
of theology to his adversaries and postulated oblique arguments of a
moral order. He admitted that Jesus, “who could count on the
considerable resources which Omnipotence offers,” did not need to make
use of a man to redeem all men. Later, he refuted those who affirm that
we know nothing of the inexplicable traitor; we know, he said, that he
was one of the apostles, one of those chosen to announce the Kingdom of
Heaven, to cure the sick, to cleanse the leprous, to resurrect the dead,
and to cast out demons (Matthew 10:7-8; Luke 9:1). A man whom the
Redeemer has thus distinguished deserves from us the best
interpretations of his deeds. To impute his crime to cupidity (as some
have done, citing John 12:6) is to resign oneself to the most torpid
motive force. Nils Runeberg proposes an opposite moving force: an
extravagant and even limitless asceticism. The ascetic, for the greater
glory of God, degrades and mortifies the flesh; Judas did the same with
the spirit. He renounced honor, good, peace, the Kingdom of Heaven, as
others, less heroically, renounced pleasure.<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>
With a terrible lucidity he premeditated his offense.</p>

<p>In adultery, there is usually tenderness and self-sacrifice; in
murder, courage; in profanation and blasphemy, a certain satanic
splendor. Judas elected those offenses unvisited by any virtues: abuse
of confidence (John 12 :6) and informing. He labored with gigantic
humility; he thought himself unworthy to be good. Paul has written:
<em>Whoever glorifieth himself, let him glorify himself in the
Lord</em>. (I Corinthians 1:31); Judas sought Hell because the felicity
of the Lord sufficed him. He thought that happiness, like good, is a
divine attribute and not to be usurped by men.<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Many have discovered post factum that in the justifiable beginnings
of Runeberg lies his extravagant end and that Dem hemlige Frälsaren is a
mere perversion or exacerbation of Kristus och Judas. Toward the end of
1907, Runeberg finished and revised the manuscript text; almost two
years passed without his handing it to the printer. In October of 1909,
the book appeared with a prologue (tepid to the point of being
enigmatic) by the Danish Hebraist Erik Erfjord and bearing this
perfidious epigraph: <em>In the world he was, and the world was made by
him, and the world knew him not</em> (John 1:10). The general argument
is not complex, even if the conclusion is monstrous. God, argues Nils
Runeberg, lowered himself to be a man for the redemption of the human
race; it is reasonable to assume that thesacrifice offered by him was
perfect, not invalidated or attenuated by any omission. To limit all
that happened to the agony of one afternoon on the cross is blasphemous.
<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> To affirm that he was a man and that
he was incapable of sin contains a contradiction; the attributes of
<em>impeccabilitas</em> and of <em>humanitas</em> are not compatible.
Kemnitz admits that the Redeemer could feel fatigue, cold, confusion,
hunger and thirst; it is reasonable to admit that he could also sin and
be damned. The famous text “He will sprout like a root in a dry soil;
there is not good mien to him, nor beauty; despised of men and the least
of them; a man of sorrow, and experienced in heartbreaks” (Isaiah
53:2-3) is for many people a forecast of the Crucified in the hour of
his death; for some (as for instance, Hans Lassen Martensen), it is a
refutation of the beauty which the vulgar consensus attributes to
Christ; for Runeberg, it is a precise prophecy, not of one moment, but
of all the atrocious future, in time and eternity, of the Word made
flesh. God became a man completely, a man to the point of infamy, a man
to the point of being reprehensible - all the way to the abyss. In order
to save us, He could have chosen any of the destinies which together
weave the uncertain web of history; He could have been Alexander, or
Pythagoras, or Rurik, or Jesus; He chose an infamous destiny: He was
Judas.</p>
<p>In vain did the bookstores of Stockholm and Lund offer this
revelation. The incredulous considered it, a priori, an insipid and
laborious theological game; the theologians disdained it. Runeberg
intuited from this universal indifference an almost miraculous
confirmation. God had commanded this indifference; God did not wish His
terrible secret propagated in the world. Runeberg understood that the
hour had not yet come. He sensed ancient and divine curses converging
upon him, he remembered Elijah and Moses, who covered their faces on the
mountain top so as not to see God; he remembered Isaiah, who prostrated
himself when his eyes saw That One whose glory fills the earth; Saul who
was blinded on the road to Damascus; the rabbi Simon ben Azai, who saw
Paradise and died; the famous soothsayer John of Viterbo, who went mad
when he was able to see the Trinity; the Midrashim, abominating the
impious who pronounce the Shem Hamephorash, the secret name of God.
Wasn’t he, perchance, guilty of this dark crime? Might not this be the
blasphemy against the Spirit, the sin which will not be pardoned
(Matthew 12:3)? Valerius Soranus died for having revealed the occult
name of Rome; what infinite punishment would be his for having
discovered and divulged the terrible name of God?   Intoxicated with
insomnia and with vertiginous dialectic, Nils Runeberg wandered through
the streets of Malmö, praying aloud that he be given the grace to share
Hell with the Redeemer.</p>
<p>He died of the rupture of an aneurysm, the first day of March 1912.
The writers on heresy, the heresiologists, will no doubt remember him;
he added to the concept of the Son, which seemed exhausted, the
complexities of calamity and evil.  </p>

<p id="asterisk-down">* From: “Artificios” (1944). In the introduction, Borges writes:
“Schopenhauer, De Quincey, Mauthner, Shaw, Chesterton, León Bloy, form
the heterogenic census of the authors I continually re-read. In the
christological fantasy titled”Three Versions of Judas” I think I
perceive the remote influence of the last [Bloy].”<a href="#asterisk-up"

<li id="fn2"><p>Euclydes da Cunha, in a book ignored by Runeberg, notes
that for the heresiarch of Canudos, Antonio Conselheiro, virtue was “a
kind of impiety almost.” An Argentine reader could recall analogous
passages in the work of Almafuerte. Runeberg published, in the symbolist
sheet Sju insegel, an assiduously descriptive poem, “The Secret Water”:
the first stanzas narrate the events of one tumultuous day; the last,
the finding of a glacial pool; the poet suggests that the eternalness of
this silent water checks our useless violence, and in some way allows
and absolves it. The poem concludes in this way:<br />
The water of the forest is still and felicitous,<br />
And we, we can be vicious and full of pain.  <a href="#fnref2"

<li id="fn3"><p>Maurice Abramowicz observes: “Jesus, d’apres ce
scandinave, a toujours le beau role; ses deboires, grace a la science
des typographes, jouissent d’une reputation polyglotte; sa residence de
trente-trois ans parmis les humains ne fut, en somne, qu’une
villegiature.” Erfjord, in the third appendix to the Christelige
Dogmatik, refutes this passage. He writes that the crucifying of God has
not ceased, for anything which has happened once in time is repeated
ceaselessly through all eternity. Judas, now, continues to receive the
pieces of silver; he continues to hurl the pieces of silver in the
temple; he continues to knot the hangman’s noose on the field of blood.
(Erfjord, to justify this affirmation, invokes the last chapter of the
first volume of the Vindication of Eternity, by Jaromir Hladlk.)<a
