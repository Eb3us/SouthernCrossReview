“Everyone now living will be dead in 100 years.”

“Not necessarily so,” my interlocutor objects. “Modern technology
could change that...radically.”

“Do you mean it could eliminate death?”

“Anything's possible.”

A third participant: “Anyway, who cares? If we're dead we're dead, no
problem.”

That was a real recent conversation about a subject which has baffled
humanity since we began thinking about it eons ago. Life, after all,
is a great mystery. From the moment it begins it marches inevitably
towards death. What, then, is the point?

I like Kierkegaard's idea (paraphrased from memory): you come to a
fork in the road of life. One direction points to despair and suicide,
because life involves much suffering and, if it is meaningless, the
thinking person will want to end it as soon as possible. The other
direction points to faith. K reasons that the philosopher (thinking
person) must choose this path if only because the other path leads to
such a miserable end. K chose the path of faith – albeit outside the
Church – and it worked for him.

But the “thinking person” has changed his thinking today.

Kierkegaard never used the word “existentialism”, and would probably
be surprised to learn that he was its founder. For his existentialism
was very different from that of the modern existentialists – Sartre,
Camus et al. – who rejected the existential label, who were atheists
and decided that since we don't know and will never know what the hell
is going on, why not just live , i.e., “exist” the best we can and be
as good as we can be. They more or less proved K wrong in that they
were able to live constructive lives (mostly), even after having
chosen K's path to despair. Still, they were cultured people and
possessed the beauty and lyricism of culture. They could look at the
great religious art of the past and listen to the music of the
spheres, thereby nurturing their souls. Cheating, as it were.

So where do I (and you) come in? I was born into a Roman Catholic
family, the members of which didn't think much about such existential
questions. My parents were young and their priorities were rising
above the working class and having a good time. (I don't mean this
critically, they pampered me very nicely.) My father, though, must
have had a thing about the Church. I say that because he never went to
mass and sent me to public schools instead of Catholic ones. But I had
to go to religious instruction once a week at a Catholic school, a
program designed for such as I, endangered by a secular education. On
one hand my father did me a big favor by not subjecting me to daily
brain washing; on the other hand public schools were very inferior to
the Catholic schools at that time in Brooklyn. The proof of this is
that when I applied to a Catholic high school, my own decision because
most of my friends were going there, I didn't make a high enough score
on the entrance exam to be accepted – and I knew I was smarter than
many of those who were accepted. (It just occurred to me that the real
reason may have been that I came from a public school and not, as the
others, from a Catholic one.) Whatever: again I was spared.

But not completely. A well-meaning aunt dragged me to mass every
Sunday when I was small and she and the nuns in religious instruction
had already imbued my poor little soul with guilt and fear, which are
the cornerstones of Catholic teaching – as well as that of other
Christian churches.

The first doubt I remember involved the Boy Scouts. There is (or was)
a holiday called Brooklyn Day in which the Boy Scout troops marched
down the main drags – in our case Ocean Avenue – waving the flags of
Brooklyn and, naturally, the United States. This holiday must have had
something to do with Protestantism, because one of the kids whose
parents were fanatical Catholics said we Catholic Scouts should ask
Monsignor King (God's representative) if we were allowed to
participate, just in case it might offend God if we did. So he and
another kid, his Sancho Panza, asked Father King, who said no, we were
not allowed to participate in that march. I told my father, who told
me to march if I wanted to and to forget Father King. I marched, along
with most of the rest of the Troop, despite the squealer warning us
that we'd go to hell if we did.

Then, a few years later, at mass one Sunday, the priest in his sermon
advised us that the new issue of the “index” of forbidden books would
be handed out at the door on leaving, that we should strictly obey it
– in order not to offend God and Jesus, who were one and the same.
When I got home I checked the Index, a long list or books, most of
which I'd never heard of, until I came to *The Three Musketeers*,
which I'd just finished reading. What? Why? Then it dawned on me:
[Cardinal Richelieu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_Richelieu)
was the bad guy. How dared Alexander Dumas accuse a Cardinal of the
Church, even fictionally, of being a power-hungry lowlife? Even if he
really was. I didn't care much about that, though. What bothered me
was that the Church was banning books just because of criticism.

Then there was Confession. As an adolescent I was a pretty adept
masturbater – if I remember correctly, and I do. Did I have the balls
to tell that representative of God, the smelly priest in his cubicle
about *that?* Actually no, I was too much ashamed and too much a
coward. I never went to Confession again, and only felt even more
guilty because of it. I would like to say that I questioned the whole
system, feeling that the priest had no more power to forgive sins than
I did. Or even if masturbating was a sin at all. (I was convinced it
was.) But that didn't come until later.

Actually, I didn't really free myself from the Church's clutches until
I was about thirty years old and read a book by Rudolf Steiner – the
Philosophy of Freedom. Not that he criticizes the Church there much,
but because it's really about Freedom with a capital F, and the
Churches don't want us to have freedom – they want to tell us what we
must think and do.

Another book which was probably also on the Index is The Brothers
Karamazov, in which the chapter about [The Grand
Inquisitor](http://www.southerncrossreview.org/46/inquisitor.htm) took
my breath away. It tells, fictionally, what would happen if Christ
came back. He would be rejected by the Church because he might say
something contrary to its teachings – about freedom – and man isn't
ready for that.

I was first initiated into the idea of reincarnation by W. Somerset
Maugham's *The Razor's Edge*. But there it is postulated from an
oriental viewpoint, which is fine for some, but not really my cup of
tea.

Reincarnation is intimately associated with the concept of karma, so
to illustrate how my karma got me where I am, I'll tell the story
briefly and, I hope, not too boringly.

In 1962 I was working for an international airline association (IATA)
and was transferred from New York to Buenos Aires – the only one from
the company to be here, meaning no infrastructure or back-up, not even
an office, and the telephones seldom worked. Why me? Hard to answer,
except that I was in the right place at the right time when we needed
someone in Argentina. (karma 2) I didn't speak Spanish and at first
wasn't sure whether Buenos Aires was in Argentina or Brazil. But off I
went with my wife and three-year-old daughter.

Backtrack: I met my German first wife when I was in the U.S. Army in
Germany only seven years after the end of the war. Her aunt and uncle
were anthroposophists, something I'd never heard of. But, as they were
the only interesting people in my wife's family, I conversed with them
fairly frequently. Except for the reincarnation part, I found
[anthroposophy](https://southerncrossreview.org/155/fts-anthroposophy-introduction.html) to
be pretty weird. When we were transferred back to the States, they
presented me with a copy of Rudolf Steiner's “An Outline of Occult
Science”. I tried to read it, but couldn't make head nor tail of it,
so I stuffed it into my duffel bag and forgot about it. (karma 1)

Fast forward to Buenos Aires: When the uncle heard that we were in
Buenos Aires, he wrote (thinking of our daughter) that there was a
Rudolf Steiner Schule there. He even gave the address: Warnes 1330
Florida. We had only been in B.A. a couple of weeks and were finding
it hard to find a permanent residence on my then miserable salary. One
day I was wandering around the city (no office to go to) and found
myself on one of B.A.'s main drags: Florida Street, so decided to
check out the school. But when I got to 1000 Florida, I was facing the
Rio de la Plata. Deciding not to swim to 1300, I turned back to other
business.

After living for a month in a temporary apartment in downtown Buenos
Aires, we put an ad in one of the city's German newspapers. There were
2: the *Freie Presse* (reactionary fascist), and the *Argentinische
Tageblatt* (liberal Jewish). We chose the latter. The next day a guy
named Pablo Rosenbaum called offering a chalet in the suburb of
Florida. Afterward he told me that his name was really Felix, but the
Argentine immigration official apparently didn't like it, so entered
Pablo on his entrance document. When his grandfather immigrated to
Germany, the immigration guy had changed his real Polish family name
to Rosenbaum. So that was twice his family had been renamed by
anti-Semitic bureaucrats. Anyway, the house was just what we needed –
and it was in a mostly German speaking enclave, where the ex (sic)
-Nazis and the Jews seemed to be getting along.

Our next door neighbors, German Mennonites who had come to Argentina
from Russia via Germany and Paraguay, told us that there was a German
school a few blocks away. We checked it out and it was the Rudolf
Steiner Schule, which I had been looking for on Florida Street in the
city, and here it was in the town of Florida. You see, I was used to
the American house numbering, so the information I had: “Warnes 1330
Florida” – where “Warnes” meant nothing to me, but it was the name of
the street with the number after it in the town of Florida. (karma 3)

It was ideal because our daughter already spoke German, although I was
more interested in her retaining her English. So I thought: this is
okay for kindergarten, but primary school will be a bilingual
English-Spanish one – if we're in Argentina that long. But after three
years of Waldorf kindergarten only an overly ambitious fool of a
father would want to take his child away from something so wonderful!

When my daughter was in the second grade a conflict exploded between
two groups of teachers. The school Board sided with group A, and our
teacher was in the minority group B. They fired her, right in the
middle of the school year. The parents objected strongly, we even
tried to take over the school in a General Meeting. That failed, so a
dozen families took our kids out and founded a new school with “our”
teacher. As a ring leader, I became president of the Board as well as
moonlighting English teacher – one hour a day before heading off to my
day job. (karma 4)

In that position I was more of less obliged to find out what the hell
I was representing, so I dug out my copy of Occult Science, which was
a bad English translation, so I obtained the German original and waded
through that. It's not an easy book, but at least I had a general idea
of what anthroposophy is: still weird, but, Waldorf education, which
is based on it, works, so there have been something I was missing.
Then two more, very different Steiner books fell into my hands: [The
Philosophy of
Freedom](http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA004/English/RSP1964/GA004_index.html)
(already mentioned) and Basic Issues of the Social Question
– which, years later, I wound up translating. Not at all weird. It was
hard to believe that they were written by the same person. Conclusion:
he wasn't mad.

Later I was transferred to Switzerland, then Germany, where I
encountered some of the negative aspects of what happened after
Steiner's death, then back to Argentina, where that school we founded
had grown exponentially. But trained teachers were in short supply, so
I co-founded the Waldorf Teachers Seminario.

But enough ego-bio. The main point is that anthroposophy, Rudolf
Steiner's teaching, had answered most of my questions, including the
purpose of life and death. It seemed that I already knew the essential
answers, only that they had been submerged in my unconscious and
needed a jolt to emerge – if only partially, like the proverbial tip
of the iceberg.

Am I an existentialist? In a way, yes. Kierkegaard wrote:

Upon this writing I am 81 years old; therefore near death,
statistically at least, something I am eminently aware of because I
have no credit, nor could I get a new credit card if I wanted one. But
*you* are also near death, regardless of your age, as you have been
since birth. Old age is not the only cause; accidents, natural
disasters, illness or war could write FIN to your autobiography at any
moment. But if a spiritual world exists as well as the physical one,
something you cannot prove to others, but which you can feel within
you, then go for it, give it the air necessary to let it rise to your
waking consciousness. Death is not proud, sooner or later it takes us
all, equally. Better, then, to existentially *choose* to meet the
spiritual world on your own terms, that is, now.
