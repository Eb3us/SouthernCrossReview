**One time I picked up a hitchhiker who told me how interesting
South America was**, and that I ought to go there. I complained
that the language is different, but he said just go ahead and
learn it - it's no big problem. So I thought, that's a good idea:
I'll go to South America.

Cornell had some foreign language classes which followed a
method used during the war, in which small groups of about ten
students and one native speaker speak only the foreign
language-nothing else. Since I was a rather young-looking
professor there at Cornell, I decided to take the class as if I
were a regular student. And since I didn't know yet where I was
going to end up in South America, I decided to take Spanish,
because the great majority of the countries there speak Spanish.

So when it was time to register for the class, we were standing
outside, ready to go into the classroom, when this pneumatic
blonde came along. You know how once in a while you get this
feeling, WOW? She looked terrific. I said to myself, "Maybe she's
going to be in the Spanish class - that'll be great!" But no, she
walked into the Portuguese class. So I figured, What the hell - I
might as well learn Portuguese.

I started walking right after her when this Anglo-Saxon
attitude that I have said, "No, that's not a good reason to decide
which language to speak." So I went back and signed up for the
Spanish class, to my utter regret.

Some time later I was at a Physics Society meeting in New York,
and I found myself sitting next to Jaime Tiomno, from Brazil, and
he asked, "What are you going to do next summer?"

"I'm thinking of visiting South America."

"Oh! Why don't you come to Brazil? I'll get a position for you
at the Center for Physical Research."

So now I had to convert all that Spanish into Portuguese! I
found a Portuguese graduate student at Cornell, and twice a week
he gave me lessons, so I was able to alter what I had learned. On
the plane to Brazil I started out sitting next to a guy from
Colombia who spoke only Spanish: so I wouldn't talk to him because
I didn't want to get confused again. But sitting in front of me
were two guys who were talking Portuguese. I had never heard real
Portuguese; I had only had this teacher who had talked very slowly
and clearly. So here are these two guys talking a blue streak,
*brrrrrrra-ta brrrrrrr-a-ta*, and I can't even hear the word for
"I," or the word for "the," or anything.

Finally, when we made a refueling stop in Trinidad, I went up
to the two fellas and said very slowly in Portuguese, or what I
thought was Portuguese, "Excuse me . . . can you understand . . .
what I am saying to you now?"

"*Pois não, porque não?*" " Sure, why not?" they replied.

So I explained as best I could that I had been learning
Portuguese for some months now, but I had never heard it spoken in
conversation, and I was listening to them on the airplane, but
couldn't understand a word they were saying.

"Oh," they said with a laugh, "*Não e Portugues! E Ladão!
Judeo!*" What they were speaking was to Portuguese as Yiddish is
to German, so you can imagine a guy who's been studying German
sitting behind two guys talking Yiddish, trying to figure out
what's the matter. *E Ladão!* It's obviously German, but it
doesn't work. He must not have learned German very well. *Judeo!*

When we got back on the plane, they pointed out another man who
did speak Portuguese, so I sat next to him. He had been studying
neurosurgery in Maryland, so it was very easy to talk with him -
as long as it was about *cirugia neural, o cerebreu*, and other
such "complicated" things. The long words are actually quite easy
to translate into Portuguese because the only difference is their
endings: "-tion" in English is "-ção" in Portuguese; "-ly" is
"-mente," and so on. But when he looked out the window and said
something simple, I was lost: I couldn't decipher "the sky is
blue."

I got off the plane in Recife (the Brazilian government was
going to pay the part from Recife to Rio) and was met by the
father-in-law of Cesar Lattes, who was the director of the Center
for Physical Research in Rio, his wife, and another man. As the
men were off getting my luggage, the lady started talking to me in
Portuguese: "You speak Portuguese? How nice! How was it that you
learned Portuguese?"

I replied slowly, with great effort. "First, I started to learn
Spanish. . . then I discovered I was going to Brazil.

Now I wanted to say, "So, I learned Portuguese," but I couldn't
think of the word for "so." I knew how to make BIG words, though,
so I finished the sentence like this: "*CONSEQUENTEMENTE, apprendi
Portugues!*

When the two men came back with the baggage, she said, "Oh, he
speaks Portuguese! And with such wonderful words:
*CONSEQUENTEMENTE!*"

Then an announcement came over the loudspeaker. The flight to
Rio was canceled, and there wouldn't be another one till next
Tuesday - and I had to be in Rio on Monday, at the latest.

I got all upset. "Maybe there's a cargo plane. I'll travel in a
cargo plane," I said.

"Professor!" they said, "It's really quite nice here in Recife.
We'll show you around. Why don't you relax - you're in *Brazil*."

That evening I went for a walk in town, and came upon a small
crowd of people standing around a great big rectangular hole in
the road - it had been dug for sewer pipes, or something - and
there, sitting exactly in the hole, was a car. It was marvelous:
it fitted absolutely perfectly, with its roof level with the road.
The workmen hadn't bothered to put up any signs at the end of the
day, and the guy had simply driven into it. I noticed a
difference: When *we'd* dig a hole, there'd be all kinds of detour
signs and flashing lights to protect us. There, they dig the hole,
and when they're finished for the day, they just leave.

Anyway, Recife *was* a nice town, and I *did* wait until next
Tuesday to fly to Rio.

When I got to Rio I met Cesar Lattes. The national TV network
wanted to make some pictures of our meeting, so they started
filming, but without any sound. The cameramen said, "Act as if
you're talking. Say something - anything."

So Lattes asked me, "Have you found a sleeping dictionary yet?"

That night, Brazilian TV audiences saw the director of the
Center for Physical Research welcome the Visiting Professor from t
he United States, but little did they know that the subject of
their conversation was finding a girl to spend the night with!

When I got to the center, we had to decide when I would give my
lectures - in the morning, or afternoon.

Lattes said, "The students prefer the afternoon."

"So let's have them in the afternoon."

"But the beach is nice in the afternoon, so why don't you give
the lectures in the morning, so you can enjoy the beach in the
afternoon."

"But you said the students prefer to have them in the
afternoon."

"Don't worry about that. Do what's most convenient for you!
Enjoy the beach in the afternoon."

So I learned how to look at life in a way that's different from
the way it is where I come from. First, they weren't in the same
hurry that I was. And second, if it's better for you, never mind!
So I gave the lectures in the morning and enjoyed the beach in the
afternoon. And had I learned that lesson earlier, I would have
learned Portuguese in the first place, instead of Spanish.

I thought at first that I would give my lectures in English,
but I noticed something: When the students were explaining
something to me in Portuguese, I couldn't understand it very well,
even though I knew a certain amount of Portuguese. It was not
exactly clear to me whether they had said "increase," or
"decrease," or "not increase," or "not decrease," or "decrease
slowly." But when they struggled with English, they'd say "ahp" or
"doon," and I knew which way it was, even though the pronunciation
was lousy and the grammar was all screwed up. So I realized that
if I was going to talk to them and try to teach them, it would be
better for me to talk in Portuguese, poor as it was. It would be
easier for them to understand.

During that first time in Brazil, which lasted six weeks, I was
invited to give a talk at the Brazilian Academy of Sciences about
some work in quantum electrodynamics that I had just done. I
thought I would give the talk in Portuguese, and two students at
the center said they would help me with it. I began by writing out
my talk in absolutely lousy Portuguese. I wrote it myself, because
if they had written it, there would be too many words I didn't
know and couldn't pronounce correctly. So I wrote it, and they
fixed up all the grammar, fixed up the words and made it nice, but
it was still at the level that I could read easily and know more
or less what I was saying. They practiced with me to get the
pronunciations absolutely right: the "de" should be in between
"deh" and "day" - it had to be just so.

I got to the Brazilian Academy of Sciences meeting, and the
first speaker, a chemist, got up and gave his talk - in English.
Was he trying to be polite, or what? I couldn't understand what he
was saying because his pronunciation was so bad, but maybe
everybody else had the same accent so *they* could understand him;
I don't know. Then the next guy gets up, and gives *his* talk in
English!

When it was my turn, I got up and said, "I'm sorry; I hadn't
realized that the official language of the Brazilian Academy of
Sciences was English, and therefore I did not prepare my talk in
English. So please excuse me, but I'm going to have to give it in
Portuguese."

So I read the thing, and everybody was very pleased with it.

The next guy to get up said, "Following the example of my
colleague from the United States, I also will give my talk in
Portuguese." So, for all I know, I changed the tradition of what
language is used in the Brazilian Academy of Sciences.

Some years later, I met a man from Brazil who quoted to me the
exact sentences I had used at the beginning of my talk to the
Academy. So apparently it made quite an impression on them.

But the language was always difficult for me, and I kept
working on it all the time, reading the newspaper, and so on. I
kept on giving my lectures in Portuguese - what I call "Feynman's
Portuguese," which I knew couldn't be the same as real Portuguese,
because I could understand what I was saying, while I couldn't
understand what the people in the street were saying.

Because I liked it so much that first time in Brazil, I went
again a year later, this time for ten months. This time I lectured
at the University of Rio, which was supposed to pay me, but they
never did, so the center kept giving me the money I was supposed
to get from the university.

I finally ended up staying in a hotel right on the beach at
Copacabana, called the Miramar. For a while I had a room on the
thirteenth floor, where I could look out the window at the ocean
and watch the girls on the beach.

It turned out that this hotel was the one that the airline
pilots and the stewardesses from Pan American Airlines stayed at
when they would "lay over" - a term that always bothered me a
little bit. Their rooms were always on the fourth floor, and late
at night there would often be a certain amount of sheepish
sneaking up and down in the elevator.

One time I went away for a few weeks on a trip, and when I came
back the manager told me he had to book my room to somebody else,
since it was the last available empty room, and that he had moved
my stuff to a new room.

It was a room right over the kitchen, that people usually
didn't stay in very long. The manager must have figured that I was
the only guy who could see the advantages of that room
sufficiently clearly that I would tolerate the smells and not
complain. I didn't complain: It was on the fourth floor, near the
stewardesses. It saved a lot of problems.

The people from the airlines were somewhat bored with their
lives, strangely enough, and at night they would often go to bars
to drink. I liked them all, and in order to be sociable, I would
go with them to the bar to have a few drinks, several nights a
week.

One day, about 3:30 in the afternoon, I was walking along the
sidewalk opposite the beach at Copacabana past a bar. I suddenly
got this treMENdous, strong feeling: "That's *just* what I want;
that'll fit just right. I'd just love to have a drink right now!"

I started to walk into the bar, and I suddenly thought to
myself, "Wait a minute! It's the middle of the afternoon. There's
nobody here, There's no social reason to drink. Why do you have
such a terribly strong feeling that you *have* to have a drink?" -
and I got scared.

I never drank ever again, since then. I suppose I really wasn't
in any danger, because I found it very easy to stop. But that
strong feeling that I didn't understand frightened me. You see, I
get such fun out of *thinking* that I don't want to destroy this
most pleasant machine that makes life such a big kick. It's the
same reason that, later on, I was reluctant to try experiments
with LSD in spite of my curiosity about hallucinations.

Near the end of that year in Brazil I took one of the air
hostesses - a very lovely girl with braids - to the museum. As we
went through the Egyptian section, I found myself telling her
things like, "The wings on the sarcophagus mean such-and-such, and
in these vases they used to put the entrails, and around the
corner there oughta be a so -and-so . . ." and I thought to
myself, "You know where you learned all that stuff? From Mary
Lou" - and I got lonely for her.

I met Mary Lou at Cornell and later, when I came to Pasadena, I
found that she had come to Westwood, nearby. I liked her for a
while, but we used to argue a bit; finally we decided it was
hopeless, and we separated. But after a year of taking out these
air hostesses and not really getting anywhere, I was frustrated.
So when I was telling this girl all these things, I thought Mary
Lou really was quite wonderful, and we shouldn't have had all
those arguments.

I wrote a letter to her and proposed. Somebody who's wise could
have told me that was dangerous: When you're away and you've got
nothing but paper, and you're feeling lonely, you remember all the
good things and you can't remember the reasons you had the
arguments. And it didn't work out. The arguments started again
right away, and the marriage lasted for only two years.

There was a man at the U.S. Embassy who knew I liked samba
music. I think I told him that when I had been in Brazil the first
time, I had heard a samba band practicing in the street, and I
wanted to learn more about Brazilian music.

He said a small group, called a “regional”, practiced at his
apartment every week, and I could come over and listen to them
play.

There were three or four people - one was the janitor from the
apartment house -and they played rather quiet music up in his
apartment; they had no other place to play. One guy had a
tambourine that they called a *pandeiro*, and another guy had a
small guitar. I kept hearing the beat of a drum somewhere, but
there was no drum! Finally I figured out that it was the
tambourine, which the guy was playing in a complicated way,
twisting his wrist and hitting the skin with his thumb. I found
that interesting, and learned how to play the *pandeiro*, more or
less.

Then the season for Carnaval began to come around. That's the
season when new music is presented. They don't put out new music
and records all the time; they put them all out during Carnaval
time, and it's very exciting.

It turned out that the janitor was the composer for a small
samba "school" - not a school in the sense of education, but in
the sense of fish - from Copacabana Beach, called *Farçantes de
Copacabana*, which means "Fakers from Copacabana," which was just
right for me, and he invited me to be in it.

Now this samba school was a thing where guys from the
*favelas* - the poor sections of the city - would come down, and
meet behind a construction lot where some apartment houses were
being built, and practice the new music for the Carnaval.

I chose to play a thing called a "*frigideira*", which is a toy
frying pan made of metal, about six inches in diameter, with a
little metal stick to beat it with. It's an accompanying
instrument which makes a tinkly, rapid noise that goes with the
main samba music and rhythm and fills it out. So I tried to play
this thing and everything was going all right. We were practicing,
the music was roaring along and we were going like sixty, when all
of a sudden the head of the *batteria* section, a great big black
man, yelled out, "STOP! Hold it, hold it - wait a minute!" And
everybody stopped. "Something's wrong with the frigideiras! " he
boomed out. "*0 Americano, outra vez!*" ("The American again!")

So I felt uncomfortable. I practiced all the time. I'd walk
along the beach holding two sticks that I had picked up, getting
the twisty motion of the wrists, practicing, practicing,
practicing. I kept working on it, but I always felt inferior, that
I was some kind of trouble, and wasn't really up to it.

Well, it was getting closer to Carnaval time, and one evening
there was a conversation between the leader of the band and
another guy, and then the leader started coming around, picking
people out: "You!" he said to a trumpeter. "You!" he said to a
singer. "You!" - and he pointed to me. I figured we were finished.
He said, "Go out in front!"

We went out to the front of the construction site - the five or
six of us - and there was an old Cadillac convertible, with its
top down. "Get in!" the leader said.

There wasn't enough room for us all, so some of us had to sit
up on the back. I said to the guy next to me, "What's he doing -
is he putting us out?"

"*Não sei, não sei.*" ("I don't know.")

We drove off way up high on a road which ended near the edge of
a cliff overlooking the sea. The car stopped and the leader said,
"Get out!" - and they walked us right up to the edge of the cliff!

And sure enough, he said, "Now line up! You first, you next,
you next! Start playing! Now march!"

We would have marched off the edge of the cliff - except for a
steep trail that went down. So our little group goes down the
trail - the trumpet, the singer, the guitar, the *pandeiro*, and
the *frigideira* - to an outdoor party in the woods. We weren't
picked out because the leader wanted to get rid of us; he was
sending us to this private party that wanted some samba music! And
afterwards he collected money to pay for some costumes for our
band.

After that I felt a little better, because I realized that when
he picked the *frigideira* player, he picked me!

Another thing happened to increase my confidence. Some time
later, a guy came from another samba school, in Leblon, a beach
further on. He wanted to join our school. The boss said, "Where're
you from?"

"Leblon." "What do you play?"

"*Frigideira*." "OK. Let me hear you play the *frigideira* ."

So this guy picked up his *frigideira* and his metal stick and
. . . "*brrra-dup-dup; chick-a-chick.*" Gee whiz! It was
wonderful!

The boss said to him, "You go over there and stand next to *O
Americano*, and you'll learn how to play the *frigideira!*"

My theory is that it's like a person who speaks French who
comes to America. At first they're making all kinds of mistakes,
and you can hardly understand them. Then they keep on practicing
until they speak rather well, and you fin d there's a delightful
twist to their way of speaking - their accent is rather nice, and
you love to listen to it. So I must have had some sort of accent
playing the *frigideira* , because I couldn't compete with those
guys who had been playing it all their lives; it must have been
some kind of dumb accent. But whatever it was, I became a rather
successful *frigideira* player.

One day, shortly before Carnaval time, the leader of the samba
school said, "OK, we're going to practice marching in the street."

We all went out from the construction site to the street, and
it was full of traffic. The streets of Copacabana were always a
big mess. Believe it or not, there was a trolley line in which the
trolley cars went one way, and the automobiles went the other way.
Here it was rush hour in Copacabana, and we were going to march
down the middle of Avenida Atlantica.

I said to myself, "Jesus! The boss didn't get a license, he
didn't OK it with the police, he didn't do anything. He's decided
we're just going to go out."

So we started to go out into the street, and everybody, all
around, was excited. Some volunteers from a group of bystanders
took a rope and formed a big square around our band, so the
pedestrians wouldn't walk through our lines. People started to
lean out of the windows. Everybody wanted to hear the new samba
music. It was very exciting!

As soon as we started to march, I saw a policeman, way down at
the other end of the road. He looked, saw what was happening, and
started diverting traffic! Everything was informal. Nobody made
any arrangements, but it worked fine. The people were holding the
ropes around us, the policeman was diverting the traffic, the
pedestrians were crowded and the traffic was jammed, but we were
going along great! We walked down the street, around the corners,
and all over the damn Copacabana, at random!

Finally we ended up in a little square in front of the
apartment where the boss's mother lived. We stood there in this
place, playing, and the guy's mother, and aunt, and so on, came
down. They had aprons on; they had been working in the kitchen,
and you could see their excitement - they were almost crying. It
was really nice to do that human stuff. And all the people leaning
out of the windows - that was terrific! And I remembered the time
I had been in Brazil before, and had seen one of these samba
bands - how I loved the music and nearly went crazy over it - and
now I was *in* it!

By the way, when we were marching around the streets of
Copacabana that day, I saw in a group on the sidewalk two young
ladies from the embassy. Next week I got a note from the embassy
saying, "It's a great thing you are doing, yak, yak, yak . . ." as
if my purpose was to improve relations between the United States
and Brazil! So it was a "great" thing I was doing.

Well, in order to go to these rehearsals, I didn't want to go
dressed in my regular clothes that I wore to the university. The
people in the band were very poor, and had only old, tattered
clothes. So I put on an old undershirt, some old pants, and so
forth, so I wouldn't look too peculiar. But then I couldn't walk
out of my luxury hotel on Avenida Atlantica in Copacabana Beach
through the lobby. So I always took the elevator down to the
bottom and went out through the basement.

A short time before Carnaval, there was going to be a special
competition between the samba schools of the beaches - Copacabana,
Ipanema, and Leblon; there were three or four schools, and we were
one. We were going to march in costume down Avenida Atlantica. I
felt a little uncomfortable about marching in one of those fancy
Carnaval costumes, since I wasn't a Brazilian. But we were
supposed to be dressed as Greeks, so I figured I'm as good a Greek
as they are.

On the day of the competition, I was eating at the hotel
restaurant, and the head waiter, who had often seen me tapping on
the table when there was samba music playing, came over to me and
said, "Mr. Feynman, this evening there's going to be something you
will love! It's tipico Brasileiro -typical Brazilian: There's
going to be a march of the samba schools right in front of the
hotel! And the music is so good - you *must* hear it."

I said, "Well, I'm kind of busy tonight. I don't know if I can
make it."

"Oh! But you'd love it so much! You must not miss it! It's
*tipico Brasileiro!*"

He was very insistent, and as I kept telling him I didn't think
I'd be there to see it, he became disappointed.

That evening I put on my old clothes and went down through the
basement, as usual. We put on the costumes at the construction lot
and began marching down Avenida Atlantica, a hundred Brazilian
Greeks in paper costumes, and I was in the back, playing away on
the *frigideira*.

Big crowds were along both sides of the Avenida; everybody was
leaning out of the windows, and we were coming up to the Miramar
Hotel, where I was staying. People were standing on the tables and
chairs, and there were crowds and crowds of people. We were
playing along, going like sixty, as our band started to pass in
front of the hotel. Suddenly I saw one of the waiters shoot up in
the air, pointing with his arm, and through all this noise I can
hear him scream, "0 PROFESSOR!" So the head waiter found out why I
wasn't able to be there that evening to see the competition - I
was *in* it!

The next day I saw a lady I knew from meeting her on the beach
all the time, who had an apartment overlooking the Avenida. She
had some friends over to watch the parade of the samba schools,
and when we went by, one of her friends exclaimed, "Listen to that
guy play the *frigideira* - he is good!" I had succeeded. I got a
kick out of succeeding at something I wasn't supposed to be able
to do.

When the time came for Carnaval, not very many people from our
school showed up. There were some special costumes that were made
just for the occasion, but not enough people. Maybe they had the
attitude that we couldn't win against the really big samba schools
from the city; I don't know. I thought we were working day after
day, practicing and marching for the Carnaval, but when Carnaval
came, a lot of the band didn't show up, and we didn't compete very
well. Even as we were marching around in the street, some of the
band wandered off. Funny result! I never did understand it very
well, but maybe the main excitement and fun was trying to win the
contest of the beaches, where most people felt their level was.
And we did win, by the way.

During that ten-month stay in Brazil I got interested in the
energy levels of the lighter nuclei. I worked out all the theory
for it in my hotel room, but I wanted to check how the data from
the experiments looked. This was new stuff that was being worked
out up at the Kellogg Laboratory by the experts at Caltech, so I
made contact with them - the timing was all arranged - by ham
radio. I found an amateur radio operator in Brazil, and about once
a week I'd go over to his house. He'd make contact with the ham
radio operator in Pasadena, and then, because there was something
slightly illegal about it, he'd give me some call letters and
would say, "Now I'll turn you over to WKWX, who's sitting next to
me and would like to talk to you."

So I'd say, "This is WKWX. Could you please tell me the spacing
between the certain levels in boron we talked about last week,"
and so on. I would use the data from the experiments to adjust my
constants and check whether I was on the right track.

The first guy went on vacation, but he gave me another amateur
radio operator to go to. This second guy was blind and operated
his station. They were both very nice, and the contact I had with
Caltech by ham radio was very effective and useful to me.

As for the physics itself, I worked out quite a good deal, and
it was sensible. It was worked out and verified by other people
later. I decided, though, that I had so many parameters that I had
to adjust - too much "phenomenological adjustment of constants" to
make everything fit - that I couldn't be sure it was very useful.
I wanted a rather deeper understanding of the nuclei, and I was
never quite convinced it was very significant, so I never did
anything with it.

In regard to education in Brazil, I had a very interesting
experience. I was teaching a group of students who would
ultimately become teachers, since at that time there were not many
opportunities in Brazil for a highly trained person in science.
These students had already had many courses, and this was to be
their most advanced course in electricity and magnetism -
Maxwell's equations, and so on.

The university was located in various office buildings
throughout the city, and the course I taught met in a building
which overlooked the hay.

I discovered a very strange phenomenon: I could ask a question,
which the students would answer immediately. But the next time I
would ask the question - the same subject, and the same question,
as far as I could tell - they couldn't answer it at all! For
instance, one time I was talking about polarized light, and I gave
them all some strips of polaroid.

Polaroid passes only light whose electric vector is in a
certain direction, so I explained how you could tell which way the
light is polarized from whether the polaroid is dark or light.

We first took two strips of polaroid and rotated them until
they let the most light through. From doing that we could tell
that the two strips were now admitting light polarized in the same
direction - what passed through one piece of polaroid could also
pass through the other. But then I asked them how one could tell
the *absolute* direction of polarization, for a *single* piece of
polaroid.

They hadn't any idea.

I knew this took a certain amount of ingenuity, so I gave them
a hint: "Look at the light reflected from the bay outside."

Nobody said anything.

Then I said, "Have you ever heard of Brewster's Angle?"

"Yes, sir! Brewster's Angle is the angle at which light
reflected from a medium with an index of refraction is completely
polarized."

"And which way is the light polarized when it's reflected?"

"The light is polarized perpendicular to the plane of
reflection, sir." Even now, I have to think about it; they knew it
cold! They even knew the tangent of the angle equals the index!

I said, "Well?"

Still nothing. They had just told me that light reflected from
a medium with an index, such as the bay outside, was polarized;
they had even told me which *way* it was polarized.

I said, "Look at the bay outside, through the polaroid. Now
turn the polaroid."

"Ooh, it's polarized!" they said.

After a lot of investigation, I finally figured out that the
students had memorized everything, but they didn't know what
anything meant. When they heard "light that is reflected from a
medium with an index," they didn't know that it meant a material
*such as water*. They didn't know that the "direction of the
light" is the direction in which you see something when you're
looking at it, and so on. Everything was entirely memorized, yet
nothing had been translated into meaningful words. So if I asked,
"What is Brewster's Angle?" I'm going into the computer with the
right keywords. But if I say, "Look at the water," nothing
happens - they don't have anything under "Look at the water"!

Later I attended a lecture at the engineering school. The
lecture went like this, translated into English: "Two bodies . . .
are considered equivalent . . . if equal torques . . . will
produce . . . equal acceleration. Two bodies, are considered
equivalent, if equal torques, will produce equal acceleration."
The students were all sitting there taking dictation, and when the
professor repeated the sentence, they checked it to make sure they
wrote it down all right. Then they wrote down the next sentence,
and on and on. I was the only one who knew the professor was
talking about objects with the same moment of inertia, and it was
hard to figure out.

I didn't see how they were going to learn anything from that.
Here he was talking about moments of inertia, but there was no
discussion about how hard it is to push a door open when you put
heavy weights on the outside, compared to when you put them near
the hinge - nothing!

After the lecture, I talked to a student: "You take all those
notes - what do you do with them?"

"Oh, we study them," he says. "We'll have an exam."

"What will the exam be like?"

"Very easy. I can tell you now one of the questions." He looks
at his notebook and says, " 'When are two bodies equivalent?' And
the answer is, 'Two bodies are considered equivalent if equal
torques will produce equal acceleration.' So, you see, they could
pass the examinations, and "learn" all this stuff, and not know
anything at all, except what they had memorized.

Then I went to an entrance exam for students coming into the
engineering school. It was an oral exam, and I was allowed to
listen to it. One of the students was absolutely super: He
answered everything nifty! The examiners asked him what
diamagnetism was, and he answered it perfectly. Then they asked,
"When light comes at an angle through a sheet of material with a
certain thickness, and a certain index N, what happens to the
light?"

"It comes out parallel to itself, sir - displaced."

"And how much is it displaced?"

"I don't know, sir, but I can figure it out." So he figured it
out. He was very good. But I had, by this time, my suspicions.

After the exam I went up to this bright young man, and
explained to him that I was from the United States, and that I
wanted to ask him some questions that would not affect the result
of his examination in any way. The first question I ask is, "Can
you give me some example of a diamagnetic substance?"

"No."

Then I asked, "If this book was made of glass, and I was
looking at something on the table through it, what would happen to
the image if I tilted the glass?"

"It would be deflected, sir, by twice the angle that you've
turned the book."

I said, "You haven't got it mixed up with a mirror, have you?"

"No, sir!"

He had just told me in the examination that the light would be
displaced, parallel to itself, and therefore the image would move
over to one side, but would not be turned by any angle. He had
even figured out how much it would be displaced, but he didn't
realize that a piece of glass is a material with an index, and
that his calculation had applied to my question.

I taught a course at the engineering school on mathematical
methods in physics, in which I tried to show how to solve problems
by trial and error. It's something that people don't usually
learn, so I began with some simple examples of arithmetic to
illustrate the method. I was surprised that only about eight out
of the eighty or so students turned in the first assignment. So I
gave a strong lecture about having to actually try it, not just
sit back and watch *me* do it.

After the lecture some students came up to me in a little
delegation, and told me that I didn't understand the backgrounds
that they have, that they can study without doing the problems,
that they have already learned arithmetic, and that this stuff f
was beneath them.

So I kept going with the class, and no matter how complicated
or obviously advanced the work was becoming, they were never
handing a damn thing in. Of course I realized what it was: They
couldn’t *do* it!

One other thing I could never get them to do was to ask
questions. Finally, a student explained it to me: "If I ask you a
question during the lecture, afterwards everybody will be telling
me, 'What are you wasting our time for in the class? We're trying
to *learn* something. And you're stopping him by asking a
question'."

It was a kind of one-upmanship, where nobody knows what's going
on, and they'd put the other one down as if they did know. They
all fake that they know, and if one student admits for a moment
that something is confusing by asking a question, the others take
a high-handed attitude, acting as if it's not confusing at all,
telling him that he's wasting their time.

I explained how useful it was to work together, to discuss the
questions, to talk it over, but they wouldn't do that either,
because they would be losing face if they had to ask someone else.
It was pitiful! All the work they did, intelligent people, but
they got themselves into this funny state of mind, this strange
kind of self-propagating "education" which is meaningless, utterly
meaningless!

At the end of the academic year, the students asked me to give
a talk about my experiences of teaching in Brazil. At the talk
there would be not only students, but professors and government
officials, so I made them promise that I could say whatever I
wanted. They said, "Sure. Of course. It's a free country."

So I came in, carrying the elementary physics textbook that
they used in the first year of college. They thought this book was
especially good because it had different kinds of typeface - bold
black for the most important things to remember, lighter for less
important things, and so on.

Right away somebody said, "You're not going to say anything bad
about the textbook, are you? The man who wrote it is here, and
everybody thinks it's a good textbook."

"You promised I could say whatever I wanted."

The lecture hall was full. I started out by defining science as
an understanding of the behavior of nature. Then I asked, "What is
a good reason for teaching science? Of course, no country can
consider itself civilized unless . . . yak, yak, yak." They were
all sitting there nodding, because I know that's the way they
think.

Then I say, "That, of course, is absurd, because why should we
feel we have to keep up with another country? We have to do it for
a good reason, a sensible reason; not just because other countries
do." Then I talked about the utility of science, and its
contribution to the improvement of the human condition, and all
that - I really teased them a little bit.

Then I say, "The main purpose of my talk is to demonstrate to
you that *no* science is being taught in Brazil!"

I can see them stir, thinking, "What? No science? This is
absolutely crazy! We have all these classes."

So I tell them that one of the first things to strike me when I
came to Brazil was to see elementary school kids in bookstores,
buying physics books. There are so many kids learning physics in
Brazil, beginning much earlier than kids do in the United States,
that it's amazing you don't find many physicists in Brazil - why
is that? So many kids are working so hard, and nothing comes of
it.

Then I gave the analogy of a Greek scholar who loves the Greek
language, who knows that in his own country there aren't many
children studying Greek. But he comes to another country, where he
is delighted to find everybody studying Greek - even the smaller
kids in the elementary schools. He goes to the examination of a
student who is coming to get his degree in Greek, and asks him,
"What were Socrates' ideas on the relationship between Truth and
Beauty?" - and the student can't answer. Then he asks the student,
What did Socrates say to Plato in the Third Symposium?" the
student lights up and goes, "*Brrrrrrrrr-up*" - he tells you
everything, word for word, that Socrates said, in beautiful Greek.

But what Socrates was talking about in the Third Symposium was
the relationship between Truth and Beauty!

What this Greek scholar discovers is, the students in another
country learn Greek by first learning to pronounce the letters,
then the words, and then sentences and paragraphs. They can
recite, word for word, what Socrates said, without realizing that
those Greek words actually mean something. To the student they are
all artificial sounds. Nobody has ever translated them into words
the students can understand.

I said, "That's how it looks to me, when I see you teaching the
kids 'science' here in Brazil." (Big blast, right?)

Then I held up the elementary physics textbook they were using.
"There are no experimental results mentioned anywhere in this
book, except in one place where there is a ball, rolling down an
inclined plane, in which it says how far the ball got after one
second, two seconds, three seconds, and so on. The numbers have
'errors' in them - that is, if you look at them, you think you're
looking at experimental results, because the numbers are a little
above, or a little below, the theoretical values. The book even
talks about having to correct the experimental errors - very fine.
The trouble is, when you calculate the value of the acceleration
constant from these values, you get the right answer. But a ball
rolling down an inclined plane, *if it is actually done*, has an
inertia to get it to turn, and will, *if you do the experiment*,
produce five-sevenths of the right answer, because of the extra
energy needed to go into the rotation of the ball. Therefore this
single example of experimental 'results' is obtained from a fake
experiment. Nobody had rolled such a ball, or they would never
have gotten those results!

"I have discovered something else," I continued. "By flipping
the pages at random, and putting my finger in and reading the
sentences on that page, I can show you what's the matter - how
it's not science, but memorizing, in every circumstance. Therefore
I am brave enough to flip through the pages now, in front of this
audience, to put my finger in, to read, and to show you."

So I did it. *Brrrrrrrup* - I stuck my finger in, and I started
to read: "Triboluminescence. Triboluminescence is the light
emitted when crystals are crushed..

I said, "And there, have you got science? No! You have only
told what a word means in terms of other words. You haven't told
anything about nature-*what* crystals produce light when you crush
them, *why* they produce light. Did you see any student go home
and *try it*? He can't.

"But if, instead, you were to write, 'When you take a lump of
sugar and crush it with a pair of pliers in the dark, you can see
a bluish flash. Some other crystals do that too. Nobody knows why.
The phenomenon is called "triboluminescence."' Then someone will
go home and try it. Then there's an experience of nature." I used
that example to show them, but it didn't make any difference where
I would have put my finger in the book; it was like that
everywhere.

Finally, I said that I couldn't see how anyone could he
educated by this self-propagating system in which people pass
exams, and teach others to pass exams, but nobody knows anything.
"However," I said, "I must be wrong. There were two students in my
class who did very well, and one of the physicists I know was
educated entirely in Brazil. Thus, it must be possible for some
people to work their way through the system, bad as it is."

Well, after I gave the talk, the head of the science education
department got up and said, "Mr. Feynman has told us some things
that are very hard for us to hear, but it appears to he that he
really loves science, and is sincere in his criticism. Therefore,
I think we should listen to him. I came here knowing we have some
sickness in our system of education; what I have learned is that
we have a cancer!" - and he sat down. ..That gave other people the
freedom to speak out, and there was a big excitement. Everybody
was getting up and making suggestions. The students got some
committee together to mimeograph the lectures in advance, and they
got other committees organized to do this and that.

Then something happened which was totally unexpected for me.
One of the students got up and said, "I'm one of the two students
whom Mr. Feynman referred to at the end of his talk. I was not
educated in Brazil; I was educated in Germany, and I've just come
to Brazil this year."

The other student who had done well in class had a similar
thing to say. And the professor I had mentioned got up and said,
"I was educated here in Brazil during the war, when, fortunately,
all of the professors had left the university, so I learned
everything by reading alone. Therefore I was not really educated
under the Brazilian system."

I didn't expect that. I knew the system was bad, but 100
percent - it was terrible!

Since I had gone to Brazil under a program sponsored by the
United States Government, I was asked by the State Department to
write a report about my experiences in Brazil, so I wrote out the
essentials of the speech I had just given. I found out later
through the grapevine that the reaction of somebody in the State
Department was, "That shows you how dangerous it is to send
somebody to Brazil who is so naive. Foolish fellow; he can only
cause trouble. He didn't understand the problems." Quite the
contrary! I think this person in the State Department was naive to
think that because he saw a university with a list of courses and
descriptions, that's what it was.

*From the book “Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman - Adventures of a Curious Character”*

**[Richard Phillips Feynman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman) (May 11, 1918 – February 15, 1988)** was an American physicist known for his work in the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics, the theory of quantum electrodynamics and the physics of the superfluidity of supercooled liquid helium, as well as in particle physics (he proposed the parton model). For his contributions to the development of quantum electrodynamics, Feynman, jointly with Julian Schwinger and Sin-Itiro Tomonaga, received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965. He developed a widely used pictorial representation scheme for the mathematical expressions governing the behavior of subatomic particles, which later became known as Feynman diagrams. During his lifetime, Feynman became one of the best-known scientists in the world. In a 1999 poll of 130 leading physicists worldwide by the British journal Physics World he was ranked as one of the ten greatest physicists of all time.
