# The U.S. has gone Mad 

## John le Carré

The United States has entered one of its periods of historical
madness, but this is the worst I can remember: worse than McCarthyism,
worse than the Bay of Pigs and in the long term potentially more
disastrous than the Vietnam War.  

The reaction to 9/11 is beyond anything Osama bin Laden could have
hoped for in his nastiest dreams. As in McCarthy times, the freedoms
that have made the United States the envy of the world are being
systematically eroded. The combination of compliant US media and
vested corporate interests is once more ensuring that a debate that
should be ringing out in every town square is confined to the loftier
columns of the East Coast press.  

The imminent war was planned years before bin Laden struck, but it
was he who made it possible. Without bin Laden, the Bush junta would
still be trying to explain such tricky matters as how it came to be
elected in the first place; Enron; its shameless favouring of the
already-too-rich; its reckless disregard for the world’s poor, the
ecology and a raft of unilaterally abrogated international treaties.
They might also have to be telling us why they support Israel in its
continuing disregard for UN resolutions.  
But bin Laden conveniently swept all that under the carpet. The
Bushies are riding high. Now 88 percent of the electorate want the
war, we are told. The US defence budget has been raised by another
\$60 billion to around \$360 billion. A splendid new generation of
nuclear weapons is in the pipeline, so we can all breathe easy. Quite
what war 88 percent of the people think they are supporting is a lot
less clear. A war for how long, please?  

At what cost in US lives? At what cost to the US taxpayer’s
pocket? At what cost — because most of those 88 percent are thoroughly
decent and humane people — in Iraqi lives?  

How Bush and his junta succeeded in deflecting US anger from bin
Laden to Saddam Hussein is one of the great public relations conjuring
tricks of history. But they swung it. A recent poll tells us that one
in two persons in the United States now believe Saddam was responsible
for the attack on the World Trade Center. But the US public is not
merely being misled. It is being browbeaten and kept in a state of
ignorance and fear. The carefully orchestrated neurosis should carry
Bush and his fellow conspirators nicely into the next election.  

Those who are not with Bush are against him.  

Worse, they are with the enemy. Which is odd, because I’m dead
against Bush, but I would love to see Saddam’s downfall — just not on
Bush’s terms and not by his methods. And not under the banner of such
outrageous hypocrisy.  

The religious cant that will send US troops into battle is perhaps
the most sickening aspect of this surreal war-to-be. Bush has an
arm-lock on God. And God has very particular political opinions. God
appointed the United States to save the world in any way that suits
the US. God appointed Israel to be the nexus of US Middle Eastern
policy, and anyone who wants to mess with that idea is (a)
anti-Semitic, (b) anti-US, (c) with the enemy, and (d) a terrorist.  

    God also has pretty scary connections. In the United States, where
all men are equal in His sight, if not in one another’s, the Bush
family numbers one president, one ex-president, one ex-head of the
CIA, the governor of Florida and the ex-governor of Texas.  
   Care for a few pointers?  
   George W. Bush, 1978-84: senior executive, Arbusto Energy/Bush
Exploration, an oil company; 1986-90: senior executive of the Harken
oil company.  
Dick Cheney, 1995-2000: chief executive of the Halliburton oil
company.  
Condoleezza Rice, 1991-2000: senior executive with the Chevron oil
company, which named an oil tanker after her.  
    And so on. But none of these trifling associations affects the
integrity of God’s work.  
    In 1993, while ex-president George Bush was visiting the
ever-democratic Kingdom of Kuwait to receive thanks for liberating
them, somebody tried to kill him. The CIA believes that "somebody" was
Saddam. Hence Bush Jr’s cry: "That man tried to kill my Daddy." But
it’s still not personal, this war. It’s still necessary. It’s still
God’s work. It’s still about bringing freedom and democracy to
oppressed Iraqi people.  
    To be a member of the team you must also believe in Absolute Good
and Absolute Evil, and Bush, with a lot of help from his friends,
family and God, is there to tell us which is which.  
    What Bush won’t tell us is the truth about why we’re going to war.
What is at stake is not an Axis of Evil — but oil, money and people’s
lives. Saddam’s misfortune is to sit on the second biggest oilfield in
the world. Bush wants it, and who helps him get it will receive a
piece of the cake. And who doesn’t, won’t.  
    If Saddam didn’t have the oil, he could torture his citizens to
his heart’s content. Other leaders do it every day — think Saudi
Arabia, think Pakistan, think Turkey, think Syria, think Egypt.  
    Baghdad represents no clear and present danger to its neighbours,
and none to the US or Britain. Saddam’s weapons of mass destruction,
if he’s still got them, will be peanuts by comparison with the stuff
Israel or the US could hurl at him at five minutes’ notice. What is at
stake is not an imminent military or terrorist threat, but the
economic imperative of US growth. What is at stake is the US need to
demonstrate its military power to all of us — to Europe and Russia and
China, and poor mad little North Korea, as well as the Middle East; to
show who rules the United States at home, and who is to be ruled by
the US abroad.  
    The most charitable interpretation of Tony Blair’s part in all
this is that he believed that, by riding the tiger, he could steer it.
He can’t. Instead, he gave it a phoney legitimacy, and a smooth voice.
Now I fear, the same tiger has him penned into a corner, and he can’t
get out.  
    It is utterly laughable that, at a time when Blair has talked
himself against the ropes, neither of Britain’s opposition leaders can
lay a glove on him. But that’s Britain’s tragedy, as it is the US's:
as our governments spin, lie and lose their credibility, the
electorate simply shrugs and looks the other way. Blair’s best chance
of personal survival must be that, at the eleventh hour, world protest
and an improbably emboldened UN will force Bush to put his gun back in
his holster unfired. But what happens when the world’s greatest cowboy
rides back into town without a tyrant’s head to wave at the boys?  
    Blair’s worst chance is that, with or without the UN, he will drag
us into a war that, if the will to negotiate energetically had ever
been there, could have been avoided; a war that has been no more
democratically debated in Britain than it has in the United States or
at the UN. By doing so, Blair will have set back our relations with
Europe and the Middle East for decades to come. He will have helped to
provoke unforeseeable retaliation, great domestic unrest, and regional
chaos in the Middle East. Welcome to the party of the ethical foreign
policy.  
    There is a middle way, but it’s a tough one: Bush dives in without
UN approval and Blair stays on the bank. Goodbye to the special
relationship.  
    I cringe when I hear my prime minister lend his head prefect’s
sophistries to this colonialist adventure. His very real anxieties
about terror are shared by all sane men.  
    What he can’t explain is how he reconciles a global assault on al
Qaeda with a territorial assault on Iraq. We are in this war, if it
takes place, to secure the fig leaf of our special relationship, to
grab our share of the oil pot, and because, after all the public
hand-holding in Washington and Camp David, Blair has to show up at the
altar.  
    "But will we win, Daddy?"  
    "Of course, child. It will all be over while you’re still in
bed."  
    "Why?"  
    "Because otherwise Bush’s voters will get terribly impatient and
may decide not to vote for him."  
    "But will people be killed, Daddy?"  
    "Nobody you know, darling. Just foreign people."  
    "Can I watch it on television?"  
    "Only if Bush says you can."  
    "And afterwards, will everything be normal again? Nobody will do
anything horrid any more?"  
    "Hush child, and go to sleep."  
    Last Friday a friend of mine in California drove to his local
supermarket with a sticker on his car saying: "Peace is also
Patriotic." It was gone by the time he’d finished shopping.
