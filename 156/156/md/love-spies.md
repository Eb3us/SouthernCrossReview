### Chapter 8

**Camp King, Oberursel, Germany**

"Are you comfortable in your quarters, Frau Cornelius?" Lt. Jacks asked
the attractive young lady seated across from him in Bavarian-American
accented German. It was his first interrogation on his own, but he had
been advised that it was routine, she was merely a defector's wife. The
room was small but tastefully decorated and they sat in padded chairs.
During the war the Germans had used it for the good-cop part of
interrogation. If the P.O.W.s, American and British flyers, were not
cooperative they went next to the dungeon below for a few days for
bad-cop softening up, no torture, just isolation, were then brought back
up for more officer and gentleman treatment. Most stuck to the name,
rank and serial number bit, but some were willing to discuss personal
things like wives, children, home towns, with their interrogators, and
this inevitably led to elements of military information. Either way,
they all wound up in P.O.W. camps.

The East Germans the Americans questioned were told they were there
voluntarily and were free to go at any time -- which was partly true:
they could leave, but if they didn't return within twenty-four hours
they would be picked up by the German police and turned over to West
German Intelligence, where they were threatened with being sent back
East, the result being that they rushed back to Camp King apologizing
profusely.

Jacks had read her husband's interrogation file and had to corroborate
the personal information, then ask her about the Foreign Affairs
Ministry, where she had worked in the travel department. Finally, what
they asked all defectors: conditions in the German Democratic Republic.

She had it all down pat: told Jacks about her husband's military career
-- going nowhere because of his lack of motivation, which created
suspicion -- the names of Foreign Affairs Ministry officials and their
travel history, as well as she could remember. Mostly they traveled
around the Eastern bloc, including Moscow; only the higher ups went to
the west, and they were too important for her to handle. Conditions? She
was supposed to tell the truth, and she did: shortages of almost
everything, although she was privileged in that respect because of her
job in the Ministry. But all her relatives and friends expected her to
buy things for them, and she had to ask an official, which she didn't
like to do, especially as most of them expected sexual favors in return,
which she refused to give. The Stasi informers were everywhere, so there
was no freedom of speech, no freedom at all in fact. They had wanted her
to be an informer and she refused, which made any possibility for
advancement impossible. And everyone knows that the Russians are really
in charge, that the so-called German Democratic Republic is nothing but
a puppet and the Russians are hated. She added, almost as an
afterthought, that if the wall came down the whole population might go
over to the west. Did they already know that? She asked herself. Was she
going too far?

"Frau Cornelius," her American interrogator was saying. "Is something
wrong?" And she realized that there were tears in her eyes and she had
almost forgotten his presence.

"No, I'm sorry, it's just that..."

Marvin Jacks had the impression that she looked familiar, even thought
of that young Russian woman he\'d met in the bar in San Francisco, and
then lost. He\'d only been with her for less than a hour and his memory
of her was dim, especially because he had been at least half-drunk. It
didn\'t occur to him that this could be the same person.

### Chapter 9

**Frankfurt, December 1968**

Lt. Marvin Jacks rented a room in a pension on Hamburger Allee in
Frankfurt. He smiled at the street's name. Did it make the love affair
sound trite, even ridiculous? In German the reference was to the city of
Hamburg, and he had every intention of keeping it a secret as far as his
American compatriots were concerned. He didn't want them installing bugs
in the room. The only other person who knew about it was the lady in
question: Frau Anneliese Cornelius. Lt. Cornelius and frau had been
thoroughly debriefed and they were let loose to pursue their lives in
West Germany. There was, however, a shade of suspicion, on the part of
Master Sergeant Jack Quinn, that they might be Stasi agents. Quinn
hadn't participated in any of the interrogations, but he\'d read the
reports, as Colonel Banks routinely asked him to do. Then the meeting
with Banks and the two interrogators, the other being a First Lt.
Hamburg (sic). Although outranked by everyone, Quinn ran the meeting.
Hamburg and Jacks had copies of the interrogation reports on their laps;
Quinn had no papers. Banks looked bored.

"You guys say you're satisfied these people are on the level, right?"
Quinn asked, looking at the two officers one after the other. Actually
neither had written exactly that in their reports. Like good bureaucrats
covering themselves just in case, they had written that they found no
indication that the Cornelius couple weren't what they said they were:
real defectors. Lt. Hamburg, was annoyed at being treated as a
subordinate by an enlisted man, Col. Banks' favorite because he had a
good jump shot. He also knew from experience, however, that Sgt. Quinn
had a nose for smelling lies. Not lies exactly -- any interrogator worth
his salt could do that -- but half-truths, which were much harder to
detect. Sgt. Quinn called it intuition. And that's why Col. Banks had
him read all the interrogation reports before making final decisions. "I
found no indication that he isn\'t," Hamburg said.

"Same difference." Quinn brushed off Hamburg's correction. He questioned
Jacks with his eyebrows. "I found nothing in Frau Cornelius's story to
think otherwise," Jacks said.

"Well, you might both be right, but something about this bothers me." He
looked at Col. Banks, seated behind his large desk, to see if he was
paying attention. Banks was. "Go on, Sergeant," he said, stroking his
mustache wisely.

"Just for a moment let's assume that they are Stasi agents," Quinn said.
"One's an army officer, the other works in the Foreign Ministry,
according to their cover story at least. This makes them interesting,
right?"

"Certainly does," Col. Banks agreed.

"They cross over and come to us. Why?" He directed the question at Lt.
Hamburg.

"Because he's army and we're army," Hamburg replied.

"Right. But why didn't they go to the West German army? Did either of
you ask that question?" He shook his head. "Never mind, it's not in your
reports. The question, then, is: Why not?"

"Goddammit, Colonel, I wish you'd remind Sgt. Quinn that we're officers
and he should address us as such."

Col. Banks raised his eyebrows and smiled ever so faintly. Then, to
Quinn: "He's right, Sergeant. But this is an informal meeting, so let's
just get on with it."

"Why not...Lieutenant?" he looked at Jacks.

Jacks suppressed the impulse to address Quinn as Sir, and said that he
hadn't thought of it.

"And you?" looking at Hamburg and infuriating him by omission.

"Because the answer is that the West Germans would have kept them in
much less comfortable circumstances than we do, and for longer, and
would have made him join the West German army to prove his loyalty, and
as an Enlisted Man to boot."

"Good reasons to come to us instead," Quinn said, "especially the E.M.
part. But how would he know that?"

"The grapevine, Quinn, probably everyone in the East German army knows
it -- the officers anyway."

"So you assumed that was the reason and didn't bother to ask, right?"

"Right."

"And you, Lt. Jacks, didn't think of it."

Jacks nodded. He liked and admired Quinn, despite being on the hot-
seat, couldn't help it. Anyway, it was his first interrogation, and of
the woman, not the army officer, so his seat wasn't that hot.

"But there could be another reason for coming to us instead of the
Germans," Quinn went on, "an even better one." He sat back like an actor
waiting for his cue. Col. Banks supplied it: "What's that, Sergeant?"

"The Germans are a hell of a lot better at this than we are. Sorry to
admit it, Sir, but it's true, inevitable."

"Why inevitable," Col. Banks asked, frowning.

"Because they're Germans, know the German soul, can detect nuances that
we can't, know more about the East German army and Stasi. So German
Military Intelligence, if there was even the whiff of suspicion, would
have turned them over to the *Bundessicherheitsdienst *-- their CIA. We
don't do that, to us they're guests from hell who have recognized the
evils of communism and are now friends. All we want is military
information.

"That's not true, Quinn," Hamburg protested. "We look for agents, too,
all the time."

"True," Quinn rejoined calmly, "but it's not our priority; it is theirs.
Furthermore, we got turnstile interrogators and analysts. You do your
tour of duty and leave or are transferred. The draftees go home just
when they're beginning to know what they're doing. The Germans aren't
going anywhere."

"What's your point, Quinn?" Lt. Hamburg asked after an embarrassing
silence.

"I thought it was obvious, Hamburg, but...."

"Col. Banks!" Hamburg almost shouted.

"We know you're an officer, Hamburg," Banks said calmly. "We can see the
bars on your shoulders. Now just shut up and listen."

Hamburg turned beet-red, and probably didn't listen.

"Anyway," Quinn went on, "they may have come to us for the reasons
stated by Lt. Hamburg -- or they may have come because they wanted to
avoid a real, hard-ass interrogation by people who would at least
suspect them."

"You mean who have other priorities," Col. Banks said.

"Yes, Sir," Quinn smiled.

"So what do you suggest?"

"That we keep them under surveillance for a while."

"Ah," the colonel said, "and how do we do that?"

Hamburg woke up. "I can assemble a surveillance team, Sir."

Banks raised his eyebrows and looked at Quinn.

"A two-day course in Munich, which is the amount of training you guys
get, doesn't make a surveillance team, Hamburg." Hamburg opened his
mouth but nothing came out. "And if they are agents, they've been
trained to spot amateur surveillance," Quinn said. "No, we have to do it
a different way."

"Er..."

"Yes, Lt. Jacks?" Col. Banks said.

"Why don't we just turn the case over to the CIA?" It was a rhetorical
question; he knew they wouldn't buy it.

Banks smiled and again looked at Quinn. He obviously didn't want to be
quoted.

"Because they're worse than us, you can spot them as Americans a mile
away. Anyway, they probably wouldn't take it seriously. After all, we
have no facts."

"Only your intuition, Sgt. Quinn," Banks said, "and that's good enough
for me. What other way?"

"Jacks can come on to the woman. Reading between the lines of his
report, I detect a rapport."

Marvin Jacks hoped his face wasn't as red as Hamburg's. They were all
looking at him. He'd intended to get in touch with her anyway, now they
were asking him to, but for a very different reason.

"Is that the case, Lt. Jacks?" Col. Banks asked.

Sgt. Quinn is very perceptive," Jacks said with a silly grin, "but yes,
we got on well."

"Okay, go on, Sergeant Quinn."

"We check her out for a few days, just to see if there's a pattern of
some place she goes where Jacks could bump into her, by accident that
is. Then Jacks makes a date with her, starts an affair if possible,
finds out if there's anything to my intuition about them."

"What about the husband?" Hamburg said, just to say something. "Well,"
Quinn answered, "if she's a loyal wife and or a good agent, Jacks'll get
shot down -- I don't mean that literally. What do you think about that
though, Lt. Jacks?"

"Her husband's not the romantic type," Jacks said. That did get a laugh.

"You willing, Lt. Jacks?" Col. Banks asked. After a short pretense of
thinking it over: "Yes, Sir."

Chapter 10

Quinn had a German driver, a friend of his employed by Camp King,
observe Frau Cornelius. He'd been in the Wehrmacht M.I. and had
surveillance experience, was also smart. After the first week he
reported back that she went to the flea market in Bockenheim two or
three times, bought some cheap stuff. Quinn asked him if she might be
making a contact there. The driver shrugged. "*Könnte sein*," he said,
but he hadn't noticed anything, though he admitted that it would be a
perfect place for it. Quinn told Jacks to let her see and approach him,
if possible. If she didn't, he should approach her, but if he thought
she wanted to avoid him they'd drop the whole thing. "And Jacks," Quinn,
damn him, said, but Jacks was used by then to being treated as his
subordinate, "remember this is work, so don't fall for her or you might
be in trouble, if what I'm thinking is true, that is."

"Don't worry about that, Sgt. Quinn." Why worry, when it had already
happened?

The meeting came off perfectly. Jacks went to the Bockenheimer flea
market the following Saturday in civvies. It was big and he didn't look
out of place, for there were other Americans there, servicemen looking
for bargains. He saw her at a used books stand concentrated on a book
she was leafing through. He strolled to the other side of the same stand
until he was directly across from her. The book she held was the first
volume of Goethe's Complete Works. He leaned across and picked up the
second volume and opened it. She saw his hand do it of course and looked
up.

"Lt. Jacks!" she said.

He looked up innocently and pretended to be trying to place her. Then,
"Frau Cornelius, what a surprise!" He walked around the stand and they
shook hands.

"Are you interested in Goethe?" she asked him.

"I'd like to be more interested, but he's a bit difficult for me, I need
a dictionary at my elbow."

She laughed. "It's a good way to improve your German."

"Undoubtedly. Are you going to buy that book?"

"No, the dealer will only sell the complete set. He's right of course.
Why break it up?"

Jacks saw his opening. "Oh? How much does he want?" The dealer, a skinny
little man with a huge mustache, was watching them from his seat at the
opposite corner of the stand. He smelled a sale.

"A hundred marks. That's frightfully expensive for used books."

"It depends on how you look at it. If they were new they'd cost a lot
more, and the words are the same."

"I suppose you're right," she said. "And they are quite beautiful, pre-
war, of course."

"Wait here," Jacks told her. He went over to the dealer, greeted him
cordially as one must, and asked if he could reserve the complete set
with twenty marks, that he would return the next day with the rest of
the money.

"Jawohl, Mein Herr, you certainly may," the dealer said and held out his
hand. Jacks gave him the twenty and he took a piece of cardboard from
his pocket, printed GEKAUFT on it, and placed it on the center volume of
the set. Jacks wondered if he could get the money back as confidential
funds, but immediately decided against asking. She isn't a spy, for
God's sake.

"I'll pay him the rest tomorrow and the first volume is yours," he told
her when he was again at her side.

"But Lt. Jacks, I couldn't accept that. Besides, you'll want to keep the
set complete."

"Maybe you can help me with Goethe's German in return." She smiled, but
didn't answer.

"How about a coffee?"

She looked at her watch and said, "I have to go now, but...When will you
pick up the books?"

"It's Sunday tomorrow, so any time really."

"Twelve?"

"Fine, it's a date."

"Auf Wiedersehen, Lt. Jacks," she said and gave him her hand.

"Auf Wiedersehen, Frau Cornelius." He watched her walk away. Not the
Germanic type at all, he thought. Dark hair, petite, beautiful in her
way. They met the next day at the book stall, he paid the remainder of
the money to the dealer, who wrapped the ten volumes in two packages.
She took one, he the other, and they walked off together. It was cold
and they were thankful for the warm gemütlich café. Jacks ordered brandy
with their coffee. She poured hers into the coffee and insisted that he
try it. He did. They stayed there over an hour. One thing led to
another. He asked her about her plans now in the west. She said that her
husband was thinking of

joining the army if they would recognize his commission. She had applied
at several places as a secretary, but she had the impression that there
was a certain prejudice against people from the east, so it wasn't easy.
She also admitted that she was thinking of leaving her husband. He was
so, well, military. It wasn't his fault really, but now that she was
free, she wanted to be completely so. After a half dozen brandies they
went to a nearby hotel and spent another hour there under the eiderdown.
Jack had fallen -- hard. He rented the room on Hamburger Allee and they
met there almost every day for a month. Then she disappeared.

That last day in their room on Hamburger Allee, Anneliese was especially
loving, sexually and, later, tenderly. Jacks felt tears on her cheeks,
but ascribed it to his love-making technique which, if the truth be
told, was amateurish compared to hers. He was twenty-one, she twenty,
and he wondered if experience or natural talent had been her teacher --
but he didn't ask. The next day she didn't show, nor the next. He
noticed that both Goethe volumes, which they had begun reading together,
were gone. Her phone didn't answer and when he went to her apartment the
landlord told him that Herr and Frau Cornelius had moved out two days
ago, without leaving a forwarding address.

To be continued.
