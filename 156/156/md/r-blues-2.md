# Reincarnation Blues

### Canto II

I\'d really like again to live\
Not this long, but longer still.\
Would I then have more to give\
With more to feel but weaker will?

There was a time in northern climes\
When I thought and felt and sought\
And willed, but failed in troubled times;\
And countless were the lies I bought.

Then in seasons southern born\
Fluttered the spirit\'s broken wing,\
Or was it an angel in female form\
Whose beauty made the cosmos sing?

When I ask myself what\
I\'m doing here I shake my head.\
It\'s neither cold here nor hot,\
The feeling I have is one of dread.

For what if I\'d traveled so long and far\
With little to show than a belly pot?\
Well, but I loved and went to war\
The war was won, the love was not.

You think it depends on what you choose.\
You better think again, baby\
And heed the Reincarnation Blues:\
Fate does the choosing, and I don\'t mean maybe.

### Christ Comes to Skopelos

![](r-blues-christ.jpg){class="a"}

Christ consents to be called\
To Skopelos\
One Easter Sunday\
Several years before his year\
Two-thousand.

They\'d been calling him continually\
In all their white-walled\
Icon-laden churches,\
Never expecting he\'d hear their songs.

He heard but will come instead\
To a hill above the town\
Where a donkey grazes\
And cypresses stand in rows\
Like green flame.

No one will see him\
No one will hear him\
When Christ consents to be called\
To Skopelos\
One Easter Sunday still to come.

Christ came to Skopelos\
One Easter Sunday\
Several years beyond the year\
Two-thousand.

They\'d been calling him relentlessly\
In all their white-walled\
Icon-laden churches,\
Never expecting he\'d hear their chants.

He heard, but came instead\
To a hill above the town\
Where a donkey grazes still\
And cypresses stand in rows\
Like green flame.

No one saw him,\
No one heard him\
When Christ came to Skopelos\
One Easter Sunday not so long ago.

### The Three is One

Forward

Taking my son to the Collegium Musicum\
Is good for his musical future, no doubt;\
For me it has advantages, too:

The hour and forty minutes spent\
Waiting at the sunny outdoor cafe\
Give me a chance to think and watch.

The bow-tied black-vested waiter\
Brings my cafecito without\
being told - and sweet cookies.

The unkempt park across the street,\
The flower-printed tablecloths,\
Sunglasses in winter, women in jeans,

Trains passing (newly privatized),\
The kiosco \"Revistas - Diarios\",\
Men smoking, uninhibited here.

I light my pipe, puff blissfully,\
My thoughts contain the past, no\
Avoiding that, the future less

Suppressed. What\'s uppermost is now.\
If life is all and this is happiness,\
How on earth can death be less?

If life is all, then this is all\
And death is all, it follows.\
Such thoughts were once reserved

For the philosopher\'s dreary den,\
Here they stoop to invitations\
From cafe idlers, now and then.

The First Circle

A young woman passes my table,\
pretty thing with long dark hair\
cut abruptly down her back,

Shoulder bag, jeans, enigmatic smile.\
Fifty years from now she\'ll ask\
why she did what she did

and wonder what\'s next on the agenda.\
She\'ll even know it\'ll soon be over.\
Maybe centuries on from now

She\'ll sit pensive at a cafe table,\
see me passing by and wonder\
who I am and we\'ll close a circle,

one of three.

The Second Circle

A boy waits for the waiter to go\
Then darts through the noonday traffic.\
Black dilated eyes are fixed

On each patron, bare arm extends\
a stubby nail-bitten hand.\
The tanned man sees only the hand,

doesn\'t look up from his paper, shakes\
his leonine head: no, no.\
Two women in fur ignore

the hand, the eyes, the begging boy.\
He comes to me. I\'ve read too\
that such as he are exploited by

their masters and giving makes it worse.\
I don\'t know, it may be true,\
but what is truth in ignorance?

I give him a peso anyway\
in case some day the roles reverse\
and I\'ll be he and he\'ll be me.

A circle is closed, the second of three.

The Third Circle

![](r-blues-circle.jpg){class="a"}

The earth is round, more or less,\
As are the heads on our shoulders.\
My coffee cup, from the bird\'s-eye view,

Is round and two-dimensional.\
The universe seems to have\
The shape of an infinite bubble.

Is this what makes the world go round?\
No, it\'s not enough, this observed,\
partly thought-out rotundity.

The unexpected blow, the theft,\
The unknown assassin\'s thrust,\
The smiling traitor\'s perfidious lie

All smudge the portrait\'s splendor.\
An imponderable upsets the equation:\
She rounds the corner and looks about

Like a lost child in a fairy fable\
She makes her way to my shaded table.\
And takes her place across from me,

For love is an ellipse and the three is one.
