had some foreign language classes which followed a method used during
the war, in which small groups of about ten students and one native
speaker speak only the foreign language-nothing else. Since I was a
rather young-looking professor there at Cornell, I decided to take
the class as if I were a regular student. And since I didn't know yet
where I was going to end up in South America, I decided to take
Spanish, because the great majority of the countries there speak
Spanish. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	when it was time to register for the class, we were standing

	She looked terrific. I said to myself, &quot;Maybe she's going to be

	now I had to convert all that Spanish into Portuguese! I found a

	Brazil I started out sitting next to a guy from Colombia who spoke
	only Spanish: so I wouldn't talk to him because I didn't want to get
	confused again. But sitting in front of me were two guys who were
	talking Portuguese. I had never heard real Portuguese; I had only
	had this teacher who had talked very slowly and clearly. So here are
	these two guys talking a blue streak, <I>brrrrrrra-ta brrrrrrr-a-ta</I>,

	I explained as best I could that I had been learning Portuguese for

	we got back on the plane, they pointed out another man who did speak
	Portuguese, so I sat next to him. He had been studying neurosurgery
	in Maryland, so it was very easy to talk with him - as long as it
	was about <I>cirugia neural, o cerebreu</I>, and other such
	&quot;complicated&quot; things. The long words are actually quite
	easy to translate into Portuguese because the only difference is
	their endings: &quot;-tion&quot; in English is &quot;-&ccedil;<FONT FACE="Cambria, serif">&atilde;</FONT>o&quot;
	in Portuguese; &quot;-ly&quot; is &quot;-<SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">mente</SPAN>,&quot;
	and so on. But when he looked out the window and said something

	<P STYLE="color: #000000"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT FACE="Cambria, serif"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 13pt">I

	had been dug for sewer pipes, or something - and there, sitting
	exactly in the hole, was a car. It was marvelous: it fitted
	absolutely perfectly, with its roof level with the road. The workmen
	hadn't bothered to put up any signs at the end of the day, and the
	guy had simply driven into it. I noticed a difference: When <I>we'd</I>
	dig a hole, there'd be all kinds of detour signs and flashing lights
	to protect us. There, they dig the hole, and when they're finished

	<P STYLE="color: #000000"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT FACE="Cambria, serif"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 13pt">So
	I learned how to look at life in a way that's different from the way
	it is where I come from. First, they weren't in the same hurry that
	I was. And second, if it's better for you, never mind! So I gave the
	lectures in the morning and enjoyed the beach in the afternoon. And
	had I learned that lesson earlier, I would have learned Portuguese
	in the first place, instead of Spanish. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	<P STYLE="color: #000000"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT FACE="Cambria, serif"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 13pt">I
	thought at first that I would give my lectures in English, but I
	noticed something: When the students were explaining something to me
	in Portuguese, I couldn't understand it very well, even though I
	knew a certain amount of Portuguese. It was not exactly clear to me
	whether they had said &quot;increase,&quot; or &quot;decrease,&quot;
	or &quot;not increase,&quot; or &quot;not decrease,&quot; or
	&quot;decrease slowly.&quot; But when they struggled with English,
	they'd say &quot;ahp&quot; or &quot;doon,&quot; and I knew which way
	it was, even though the pronunciation was lousy and the grammar was
	all screwed up. So I realized that if I was going to talk to them
	and try to teach them, it would be better for me to talk in
	Portuguese, poor as it was. It would be easier for them to
	understand. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	that first time in Brazil, which lasted six weeks, I was invited to
	give a talk at the Brazilian Academy of Sciences about some work in
	quantum electrodynamics that I had just done. I thought I would give
	the talk in Portuguese, and two students at the center said they
	would help me with it. I began by writing out my talk in absolutely
	lousy Portuguese. I wrote it myself, because if they had written it,
	there would be too many words I didn't know and couldn't pronounce
	correctly. So I wrote it, and they fixed up all the grammar, fixed
	up the words and made it nice, but it was still at the level that I
	could read easily and know more or less what I was saying. They
	practiced with me to get the pronunciations absolutely right: the
	&quot;de&quot; should be in between &quot;deh&quot; and &quot;day&quot;

	got to the Brazilian Academy of Sciences meeting, and the first

	saying because his pronunciation was so bad, but maybe everybody
	else had the same accent so <I>they</I> could understand him; I

	said, &quot;And there, have you got science? No! You have only told
	what a word means in terms of other words. You haven't told anything
	about nature-<I>what</I> crystals produce light when you crush them,
	<I>why</I> they produce light. Did you see any student go home and

	if, instead, you were to write, 'When you take a lump of sugar and

	phenomenon is called &quot;triboluminescence.&quot;' Then someone
	will go home and try it. Then there's an experience of nature.&quot;
	I used that example to show them, but it didn't make any difference

	I said that I couldn't see how anyone could he educated by this
	self-propagating system in which people pass exams, and teach others
	to pass exams, but nobody knows anything. &quot;However,&quot; I
	said, &quot;I must be wrong. There were two students in my class who
	did very well, and one of the physicists I know was educated
	entirely in Brazil. Thus, it must be possible for some people to

	<P STYLE="color: #000000"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT FACE="Cambria, serif"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 13pt">Well,
	after I gave the talk, the head of the science education department
	got up and said, &quot;Mr. Feynman has told us some things that are
	very hard for us to hear, but it appears to he that he really loves
	science, and is sincere in his criticism. Therefore, I think we
	should listen to him. I came here knowing we have some sickness in
	our system of education; what I have learned is that we have a
	cancer!&quot; - and he sat down. ..That gave other people the
	freedom to speak out, and there was a big excitement. Everybody was
	getting up and making suggestions. The students got some committee
	together to mimeograph the lectures in advance, and they got other
	committees organized to do this and that. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	<P STYLE="color: #000000"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT FACE="Cambria, serif"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 13pt">Then
	something happened which was totally unexpected for me. One of the
	students got up and said, &quot;I'm one of the two students whom Mr.
	Feynman referred to at the end of his talk. I was not educated in
	Brazil; I was educated in Germany, and I've just come to Brazil this
	year.&quot; </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	other student who had done well in class had a similar thing to say.
	And the professor I had mentioned got up and said, &quot;I was
	educated here in Brazil during the war, when, fortunately, all of
	the professors had left the university, so I learned everything by
	reading alone. Therefore I was not really educated under the
	Brazilian system.&quot; </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT FACE="Cambria, serif"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 13pt">Since
	I had gone to Brazil under a program sponsored by the United States
	Government, I was asked by the State Department to write a report
	about my experiences in Brazil, so I wrote out the essentials of the
	speech I had just given. I found out later through the grapevine
	that the reaction of somebody in the State Department was, &quot;That
	shows you how dangerous it is to send somebody to Brazil who is so
	naive. Foolish fellow; he can only cause trouble. He didn't
	understand the problems.&quot; Quite the contrary! I think this
	person in the State Department was naive to think that because he
	saw a university with a list of courses and descriptions, that's
	what it was.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<H3 CLASS="western" STYLE="font-weight: normal">From the book &ldquo;Surely
You're Joking, Mr. Feynman - Adventures of a Curious Character&rdquo;</H3>
<h4><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman">Richard Phillips Feynman</a> (May 11, 1918  February 15, 1988) was an American physicist known for his work in the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics, the theory of quantum electrodynamics and the physics of the superfluidity of supercooled liquid helium, as well as in particle physics (he proposed the parton model). For his contributions to the development of quantum electrodynamics, Feynman, jointly with Julian Schwinger and Sin-Itiro Tomonaga, received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965. He developed a widely used pictorial representation scheme for the mathematical expressions governing the behavior of subatomic particles, which later became known as Feynman diagrams. During his lifetime, Feynman became one of the best-known scientists in the world. In a 1999 poll of 130 leading physicists worldwide by the British journal Physics World he was ranked as one of the ten greatest physicists of all time.</h4>
