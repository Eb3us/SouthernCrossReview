<p class=MsoPlainText style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US>      </span><b><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Garamond'>It is the vernal
equinox, and the ritual has begun</span></b><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Garamond'>. The participants enter into the sacred quadrant
and take their stations at geometrically significant places. They are all men,
dressed in pure white garb, marked with colorful esoteric symbols. They hold
ritual implements in their hands. Four more men arrive; they are dressed in
dark blue. Like concelebrating priests, they confer on the details of the
liturgy. Then they too take their places. </span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Garamond'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Garamond'>            A sacred hymn is
intoned, and after that come the opening words of the ceremony: &quot;PLAY
BALL!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Garamond'>            </span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Garamond'>            We need look no
further than the local baseball diamond to find high ritual. There is no need
to hanker after secret Masonic rites in closed halls or occult workings in
incense-filled chambers. Wherever baseball is played, a true ritual goes on, as
exoteric as daylight, as powerful as spring.</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Garamond'>            </span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Garamond'>            Far more than other
sports, baseball shows an esoteric structure. The game is played on a
geomantically perfect square. Each base stands at what would be the quarters in
Western esoteric ritual. These four bases also stand for the four elements,
though attributions are variable: Home plate, with its coating of dust, seems
to be Earth, while third base is traditionally referred to as the &quot;hot
corner,&quot; signifying Fire. In the center is the pitcher's mound, a circle
in the middle of the square mandala, which speaks to us of the fifth element of
Spirit, or the center point of wholeness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Garamond'>            </span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Garamond'>            The men on the field
hold to their positions as reverently as any Masonic or Hermetic ritualist. In
the outfield stand the attendants in the outer courts. On each of the quarters
stands a baseman, guarding his sacred trust. The shortstop moves between inner
and outer, like swift Hermes, who moves between the worlds. The catcher, at his
Earth station, also serves as Guardian of the Threshold; he challenges those
who would enter or leave the quadrant as base runners. In the center is the
pitcher, or Hierophant, upon whose offerings the course of the ritual depends.
Completing the scene are the priests in blue, the umpires, who know the Law and
keep the ritual correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Garamond'>            </span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Garamond'>            For rookies, each
time at bat is an initiation; for others, wielding the sacred wand can be
either an ordeal or a triumph. (For the sake of brevity, I will not elaborate
on the phallic aspects of this ritual, which is done only by men and only
during the most fertile times of the year.) Baseball is enriched not only by
the geomancy of the field, but also by the numerology of the play itself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Garamond'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Garamond'>            The batter's ordeal
may include a trinitarian three strikes, or four balls, which answer to the
quadratic structure of the ritual space. The normal game lasts nine innings,
that perfect number composed of three squared. Nine men play on a team at any
one time (omitting the ritually incorrect designated hitter). These numbers are
fraught with religious and occult significance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Garamond'>            </span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Garamond'>            Baseball time is
sacred time. Football, hockey, soccer and basketball run by the clock. Play is
constrained by the seconds and minutes of linear time. Baseball's time, though,
is nonlinear, relativistic, where an inning can last as little as a few
minutes, or as long as an hour. Indeed, the pace of the game is determined by
the motion and position of the ball. Time moves slowly when the ball is hidden
in the Hierophant's glove, but moves far more quickly when that same ball is
sailing over the left field wall for a home run.</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Garamond'>            </span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Garamond'>            When that home run
flies out of the ritual space into the outer depths, the happy ritualist puts
down his wand and makes a circumambulation of the quadrant. Other baseball
moves and customs show a similar respect for the hidden energies unleashed in
this rite. Those men who face the Hierophant and his kneeling acolyte known as
the catcher are seen to do all sorts of personal ritual gestures: crossing
oneself, touching various parts of the body, spitting, or gesturing with the
wand. All of these are aids to concentration; they also serve as banishing
rituals in this moment of pressure.</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Garamond'>            </span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Garamond'>            The spectators at the
baseball rite are not restricted or silenced. They participate with their
applause, cheers, mockery, or spontaneous cries. As would be expected of the
profane, much profanity comes forth. Sacred objects are often displayed by the fans
(the very name &quot;fan&quot; comes from &quot;fanatic,&quot; which derives
from the Latin fanum or temple); they hold banners, wear special headgear with
appropriate symbols, and show garb decorated with the same symbols as the
working group whose efforts they support.</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Garamond'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Garamond'>            Fermented libations
and ritual meals are a part of the baseball experience. The rite unites a
community in a closeness that few religious liturgies, whether mainstream or
esoteric, can achieve.</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Garamond'>            </span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Garamond'>            The success of a high
sporting ritual such as baseball teaches us some much-needed lessons about the
esoteric way. First of all, the Diamond Way is open and accessible. No secret teachings
or initiatory grades are needed to participate, only a ticket to the bleachers.
This is as exoteric a ritual as one can find; nevertheless, the inner structure
is there for those who understand. Mystical meaning is hidden in plain sight.
Second, baseball is democratic. Though the major leagues are an initiated
elite, anyone can come to their games, and anyone can buy the sacred implements
of wand and glove and orb and play in a sandlot ritual space. The Ascended
Masters of Cooperstown smile on anyone who wishes to play.</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Garamond'>            </span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Garamond'>            Finally, baseball
reminds us that there is an element of ritual in all games, and that a ritual
is in itself a kind of game, played by a team within a sacred space, with
special garb and implements. The outcome of a ritual, however, is not reflected
on a scoreboard in hits and runs. The ritual game has a value that is far more
abstract and less subject to the dualism of winning and losing. But a failure
in ritual, like a loss in baseball, is not eternal: there is always next game
or next year. And success in ritual, as in baseball, brings joy to a community
and a whole city. It connects sacred and profane, inner and outer worlds.
Ritual is sacred play, which brings cosmic inspiration to its participants on
common ground.</span></p>
