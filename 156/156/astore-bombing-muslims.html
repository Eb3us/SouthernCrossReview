<h3>Isn't It Time to Put Our Toy Soldiers Away (Along with Our Illusions)?</h3>
<h2>By <a href="https://tomdispatch.com/authors/williamastore/">William J. Astore</a></h2>


</header>

<main>
<p class="intro">Like many American boys of the baby-boomer generation, I played “war”
with those old, olive-drab, plastic toy soldiers meant to evoke our
great victory over the Nazis and “the Japs” during World War II. At age
10, I also kept a scrapbook of the 1973 Yom Kippur War between Israel
and its various Arab enemies in the Middle East. It was, I suppose, an
early sign that I would make both the military and the study of history
into careers.</p>
<p>I recall rooting for the Israelis, advertised then as crucial
American allies, against Egypt, Syria, and other regional enemies at
least ostensibly allied with the Soviet Union in that Cold War era. I
bought the prevailing narrative of a <a
href="https://bracingviews.substack.com/p/david-versus-goliath-in-the-middle-east">David-versus-Goliath</a>
struggle. I even got a book on the Yom Kippur War that captivated me by
displaying all the weaponry the U.S. military had rushed to Israel to
turn the tide there, including F-4 Phantom jets and M-60 main battle
tanks. (David’s high-tech slingshots, if you will.) Little did I know
that, in the next 50 years of my life, I would witness increasingly
destructive U.S. military attacks in the Middle East, especially after
the oil cartel OPEC (largely Middle Eastern then) hit back hard with an
embargo in 1973 that sent our petroleum-based economy into a
tailspin.</p>
<p><span id="anchor"></span>As one jokester quipped: Who put America’s
oil under the sands of all those ungrateful Muslim countries in the
Middle East? With declarations like the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carter_Doctrine">Carter Doctrine</a>
in 1980, the U.S. was obviously ready to show the world just how eagerly
it would defend its “vital interests” (meaning fossil fuels, of course)
in that region. And even today, as we watch the latest round in this
country’s painfully consistent record of attempting to pound various
countries and entities there into submission, mainly via repetitive air
strikes, we should never forget the <a
href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/why-we-fight-oil_b_1824765">importance
of oil</a>, and lots of it, to keep the engines of industry and war
churning along in a devastating fashion.</p>
<p>Right now, of course, the world is witnessing yet another U.S. <a
href="https://news.antiwar.com/2024/02/04/us-uk-launch-another-round-of-heavy-strikes-on-yemen/">bombing
campaign</a>, the latest in a series that seems all too predictable (<a
href="https://theintercept.com/2024/01/18/biden-yemen-houthi-airstrikes/">and
futile</a>), meant to teach the restless rebels of Iraq, Syria, Yemen,
and possibly even Iran a lesson when it comes to messing with the United
States of America. As the recently deceased country singer <a
href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/02/06/nation/beer-my-horses-singer-songwriter-toby-keith-has-died-after-battling-stomach-cancer/">Toby
Keith</a> put it: Mess with this country and “We’ll <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9r0haVPDAo">put a boot</a>
(think: bomb) in your ass.” You kill <a
href="https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3659809/3-us-service-members-killed-others-injured-in-jordan-following-drone-attack/">three
soldiers</a> of ours and we’ll kill scores, if not hundreds, if not
thousands of yours (and it doesn’t really matter if they’re soldiers or
not), because… well, because we damn well can!</p>
<p>America’s leaders, possessing a peerless Air Force, regularly exhibit
a <a
href="https://tomdispatch.com/william-astore-the-dark-side-of-air-power/">visceral
willingness</a> to use it to bomb and missile perceived enemies into
submission or, if need be, nothingness. And don’t for a second think
that they’re going to be stopped by international law, humanitarian
concerns, well-meaning protesters, or indeed any force on this planet.
America bombs because it can, because it believes in the <a
href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/bread-and-circuses-in-rom_b_3414248">efficacy
of violence</a>, and because it’s run by appeasers.</p>
<p>Yes, America’s presidents, its bombers-in-chief, are indeed
appeasers. Of course, they think they’re being strong when they’re
blowing distant people to bits, but their actions invariably showcase a
distinctive kind of weakness. They eternally seek to appease the <a
href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/dwight-eisenhower-memorial_b_1270232">military-industrial-congressional</a><a
href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/dwight-eisenhower-memorial_b_1270232">complex</a>,
aka the national (in)security state, a complex state-within-a-state with
an unappeasable hunger for power, profit, and ever more destruction.
They fail and fail and fail again in the Middle East, yet they’re
incapable of not ordering more bombing, <a
href="https://tomdispatch.com/william-astore-predatory-dreams/">more
droning</a>, more killing there. Think of them as being possessed by a
monomania for war akin to my urge to play with toy soldiers. The key
difference? When I played at war, I was a wet-behind-the-ears 10 year
old.</p>
<p><strong>The Rockets’ Red Glare, the Bombs Bursting in
Air</strong></p>
<p>No technology may be more all-American than bombs and bombers and no
military doctrine more American than the urge to attain “peace” through
<a
href="https://tomdispatch.com/william-astore-predatory-dreams/">massive
firepower</a>. In World War II and subsequent wars, the essential U.S.
approach could be summarized in five words: mass production enabling
mass destruction.</p>
<p>No other country in the world has dedicated such vast resources as
mine has to mass destruction through air power. Think of the full-scale
bombing of cities in Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan in World War II,
ending in the atomic destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Think of the
flattening of North Korea during the Korean War of the early 1950s or
the staggering bombing campaigns in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia in the
1960s and early 1970s. Or consider the massive use of air power in
Desert Shield against Iraq in the early 1990s followed by the air
campaigns that accompanied the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq in 2003
(and never quite seemed to stop thereafter). The butcher’s bill for such
bombing has indeed been high, quite literally millions of non-combatants
killed by America’s self-styled “arsenal of democracy.”</p>

<p>And indeed, as you read this, another country is now faithfully
following America’s example. Israel is systematically destroying Gaza,
rendering it essentially uninhabitable for those Palestinians who
survive the ongoing rampage. In fact, early in its war of annihilation,
Israeli leaders <a
href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/23/israel-gaza-war-wwii-palestine">cited</a>
the Allied destruction of the German city of Dresden in 1945 in support
of their own atrocious air and ground campaign against the
Palestinians.</p>
<p>Looking at this dispassionately as a military historian, the Dresden
reference makes a certain twisted sense. In World War II, the Americans
and their British allies in their “combined bomber offensive” destroyed
German cities indiscriminately, seeing all Germans as essentially Nazis,
complicit in the crimes of their government, and so legitimate targets.
Something similar is true of the right-wing Israeli government today. It
sees all Palestinians as essentially members of Hamas and thus complicit
in last year’s brutal October 7th attacks on Israel, making them
legitimate targets of war, Israeli- (and American-) style. Just like the
United States, Israel claims to be “defending democracy” whatever it
does. Little wonder, then, that Washington has been so willing to send
bombs and bullets to its protégé as it seeks “peace” through massive
firepower and genocidal destruction.</p>
<p>Indeed, of late, there has been considerable debate about whether
Israel is engaged in acts of genocide, with the International Court of
Justice ruling that the present government should strive to prevent just
such acts in Gaza. Putting that issue aside, it’s undeniable that Israel
has been using <a
href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/biden-takes-a-tougher-stance-on-israels-indiscriminate-bombing-of-gaza">indiscriminate
bombing</a> attacks and a devastating invasion in a near-total war
against Palestinians living on that 25-mile-long strip of land, an
approach that calls to mind the harrowing catchphrase “Exterminate all
the brutes!” from Joseph Conrad’s novel <em>Heart of Darkness</em>.</p>
<p>In a sense, there’s nothing new under the sun. Certainly, the Old
Testament itself provides examples of exterminatory campaigns (<a
href="https://www.financial-world.org/news/news/financial/22857/netanyahu-openly-calls-for-genocide-citing-the-bible-go-attack-the-amalekites-/">cited
by Bibi Netanyahu</a> as Israel first moved against the Palestinians in
Gaza). He might as well have cited a catchphrase heard during America’s
war in Vietnam, but rooted in the medieval <a
href="https://www.thisdayinquotes.com/2019/07/kill-them-all-and-let-god-sort-them-out/">crusades</a>:
“Kill them all and let God sort them out.”</p>
<p><strong>America’s Unrelenting Crusade in the Middle East</strong></p>
<p>In the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, President George W.
Bush got into trouble almost instantly when he referred to the “war on
terror” he had launched as a “<a
href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1001020294332922160">crusade</a>.”
Yet, as impolitic as that word might have seemed, how better to explain
U.S. actions in the Middle East and Afghanistan? Just consider our faith
in the goodness and efficacy of “our” military and that all-American
urge to bring “democracy” to the world, despite the destruction visited
upon Iraq, Libya, Syria, and Yemen over the last several decades. Or go
back to 1953 and the role the CIA played in the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_Iranian_coup_d%27état">overthrow</a>
of Iran’s legitimate democratic ruler and his replacement by the
brutally repressive regime of the Shah.</p>
<p>Try to imagine such events from the perspective of a historian
writing in the year 2200. Might that future scribe not refer to repeated
U.S. invasions of, incursions into, and bombing campaigns across the
Middle East as a bloody crusade, launched under the (false) banner of
democracy with righteous vengeance, if not godly purpose, in mind? Might
that historian not suggest that such a “crusade” was ultimately more
about power and profit, domination and control than (as advertised)
“freedom”? And might that historian not be impressed (if not depressed)
by the remarkable way the U.S. brought seemingly unending chaos and
death to the region over such a broad span of time?</p>
<p>Consider these facts. More than 22 years after the 9/11 attacks, the
U.S. still has at least <a
href="https://www.npr.org/2024/02/05/1229295276/recent-violence-raises-questions-about-why-u-s-has-so-many-troops-in-the-middle-">30,000
troops</a> scattered across the Middle East. At least one Navy carrier
strike group, and <a
href="https://www.nbcnews.com/now/video/-u-s-deploys-second-navy-carrier-strike-group-to-middle-east-195722821789">often
two</a>, dominate the regional waters, while striking numbers of
military bases (“Little Americas”) are still <a
href="https://www.americansecurityproject.org/national-security-strategy/u-s-bases-in-the-middle-east/">sprinkled
across</a> countries ranging from Kuwait to Bahrain, from Qatar to the
United Arab Emirates and beyond. So many years later, about <a
href="https://www.voanews.com/a/us-troops-in-middle-east-what-are-they-doing-and-where-/7469452.html">900
U.S. troops</a> still illegally occupy part of Syria (not
coincidentally, where that country produces most of its oil) and <a
href="https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2024-01-30/explainer-what-are-us-troops-doing-in-the-middle-east-and-where-are-they">2,500
more</a> remain in Iraq, even though the government there would like
them to depart.</p>
<p><strong>Yankee Go Home? Apparently Not in My Lifetime</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, American military aid, mostly in the form of <a
href="https://stephensemler.substack.com/p/us-arms-exports-hit-a-record-high">deadly
weaponry</a>, flows not only to Israel but to other countries in the
region like Egypt and Jordan. Direct <a
href="https://www.airforcetimes.com/news/your-air-force/2022/04/08/us-awaits-final-17-million-repayment-from-saudis-for-air-refueling-in-yemen-war/">U.S.
military support</a> facilitated Saudi Arabia’s long, destructive, and
unsuccessful war against the Houthis in Yemen, a conflict Washington is
now conducting on its own with repeated air strikes. And of course, the
entire region has, for more than two decades now, been under constant
U.S. military pressure in that war on terror, which all too quickly
became a war of terror (and <a
href="http://www.niemanwatchdog.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=ask_this.view&amp;askthisid=00386">of
torture</a>).</p>
<p>Recall that the U.S. <a
href="https://ronpaulinstitute.org/silencing-war-criticism-the-iraq-invasion-of-2003/">invasion
of Iraq</a> in 2003 led to the death of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Iraq_War">roughly
a million</a> <a
href="https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/papers/2023/IndirectDeaths">Iraqis</a>
and the displacement of <a
href="https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/files/cow/imce/papers/2021/Costs%20of%20War_Vine%20et%20al_Displacement%20Update%20August%202021.pdf">millions
more</a> as refugees. How could that not be considered part of a
“crusade,” even if a fitful and failing one? Yet, here’s the rub: just
as those Catholic crusades of the Middle Ages weren’t entirely or even
primarily about religion, so today’s American version isn’t motivated
primarily by an anti-Muslim animus. Of course, there is indeed an
inescapably religious aspect to such never-ending American war-making,
but what drives those wars is largely naked greed, vengeance, and an
all-American urge both to appease and amplify the <a
href="https://tomdispatch.com/a-highway-to-peace-or-a-highway-to-hell/">military-industrial-congressional
complex</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, as was true in the years after 9/11 and is still true
today, Americans are generally encouraged to see their country’s
imperial and crusading acts as purely defensive in nature, the righteous
responses of freedom-bringers. Admittedly, it’s a strange kind of
freedom this country brings at the tip of a sword — or on the nosecone
of a Hellfire missile. Even so, in such an otherwise thoroughly
contentious Congress, it should be striking <a
href="https://issuechronicle.substack.com/p/as-the-president-continues-to-bomb">how
few members</a> have challenged the latest bombing version of this
country’s enduring war in the Middle East.</p>
<p>Forget the Constitution. No Congressional declaration of war is
believed necessary for any of this, nor has it mattered much (so far)
that the American public has grown increasingly skeptical of those wars
and the acts of destruction that go with them. As it happens, however,
the crusade, such as it is, has proven remarkably sustainable without
much public crusading zeal. For most Americans, those acts remain
distinctly off-stage and largely out of mind, except at moments like the
present one where the deaths of three American soldiers give the
administration all the excuse it needs for repetitive acts of
retaliation.</p>
<p>No, we the people exercise remarkably little control over the
war-making that the <a
href="https://tomdispatch.com/can-the-military-industrial-complex-be-tamed/">military-industrial-congressional
complex</a> has engaged in for decades or the costs that go with them.
Indeed, the dollar costs are largely deferred to future generations as
America’s national debt climbs even faster than the Pentagon war
budget.</p>
<p>America, so we were told by President George W. Bush, is hated for
its freedoms.  Yet the “freedoms” we’re allegedly hated for aren’t those
delineated in the Constitution and its Bill of Rights.  Rather, it’s
America’s “freedom” to build military bases across the globe and bomb
everywhere, a “freedom” to sell such bellicose activity as lawful and
even admirable, a “freedom” to engage in a hyperviolent style of play,
treating “our” troops and so many foreigners as toy soldiers and
expendable props for Washington’s games.  </p>
<p>It’s something I captured unintentionally five decades ago with those
toy soldiers of mine from an imagined glorious military past.  But after
a time (too long, perhaps) I learned to recognize them as the childish
things they were and put them away.  They’re now long gone, lost to time
and maturity, as is the illusion that my country pursues freedom and
democracy in the Middle East through ceaseless acts of extreme violence,
which just seem to<a
