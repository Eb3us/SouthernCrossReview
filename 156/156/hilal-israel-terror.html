<p class="intro">In a <em>New Yorker</em> piece published five days after the attacks
of September 11, 2001, American critic and public intellectual Susan
Sontag <a
href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2001/09/24/tuesday-and-after-talk-of-the-town">wrote</a>,
“Let’s by all means grieve together. But let’s not be stupid together. A
few shreds of historical awareness might help us understand what has
just happened, and what may continue to happen.” Sontag’s desire to
contextualize the 9/11 attacks was an instant challenge to the
narratives that President George W. Bush would soon deploy, painting the
United States as a country of peace and, most importantly, innocent of
any wrongdoing. While the rhetorical strategies he developed to justify
what came to be known as the Global War on Terror have continued to this
day, they were not only eagerly embraced by Israel in 2001, they also
lie at the heart of that country’s justification of the genocidal
campaign that’s been waged against the Palestinian people since October
7, 2023.</p>
<p>On September 20, 2001, President Bush delivered a speech to Congress
in which he shared a carefully constructed storyline that would justify
endless war. The United States, <a
href="https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/09/20010920-8.html">he
said</a>, was attacked because the terrorists “hate our freedoms — our
freedom of religion, our freedom of speech, our freedom to vote and
assemble and disagree with each other.” In that official response to the
9/11 attacks, he also used the phrase “war on terror” for the first
time, <a
href="https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/09/20010920-8.html">stating</a>
(all too ominously in retrospect): “Our war on terror begins with
al-Qaeda, but it does not end there. It will not end until every
terrorist group of global reach has been found, stopped, and
defeated.”</p>
<p><span id="anchor"></span>“Americans are asking,” he went on, “why do
they hate us?” And then he provided a framework for understanding the
motives of the “terrorists” precluding the possibility that American
actions prior to 9/11 could in any way have explained the attacks. In
other words, he positioned his country as a blameless victim, shoved
without warning into a “post-9/11 world.” As Bush put it, “All of this
was brought upon us in a single day — and night fell on a different
world, a world where freedom itself is under attack.” As scholar Richard
Jackson <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/48602563">later noted</a>,
the president’s use of “our war on terror” constituted “a very carefully
and deliberately constructed public discourse… specifically designed to
make the war seem reasonable, responsible, and inherently ‘good.’”</p>
<p><strong>Your Fight Is Our Fight</strong></p>
<p>The day after the 9/11 attacks, then-Prime Minister Ariel Sharon gave
a televised address to Israelis, <a
href="https://www.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/asiapcf/east/09/11/terror.reax/index.html">saying
that</a> “the fight against terrorism is an international struggle of
the free world against the forces of darkness who seek to destroy our
liberty and way of life. Together, we can defeat these forces of evil.”
Sharon, in other words, laid out Israel’s fight in the same binary terms
the American president would soon use, a good-versus-evil framework, as
a way of rejecting any alternative explanations of those assaults on the
Pentagon and the World Trade Center in New York City that killed almost
3,000 people. That December, Sharon <a
href="https://wrlc-amu.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/fulldisplay?docid=alma9968271803604102&amp;context=L&amp;vid=01WRLC_AMU:prod&amp;lang=en&amp;search_scope=WRLC_P_AU&amp;adaptor=Local%20Search%20Engine&amp;tab=WRLC_P_AU&amp;query=any,contains,The%20War%20on%20Terror%20in%20Comparative%20Perspective:%20US%20Security%20and%20Foreign%20Policy&amp;offset=0">responded</a>
to an attack in Jerusalem by two Palestinian suicide bombers by saying
that he would launch his own “war on terror… with all the means at our
disposal.”</p>

<p>On the day of Bush’s September 20th speech, Benjamin Netanyahu, then
working in the private sector after holding various positions within the
Israeli government, capitalized on the president’s narrative by
asserting Israel’s enthusiastic support for the United States. In a
statement offered to the House Government Reform Committee, emphasizing
his country’s commitment to fighting terrorism, Netanyahu <a
href="https://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/netanyahu.htm">stated</a>,
“I am certain that I speak on behalf of my entire nation when I say
<em>today</em>, we are all Americans — in grief, as in defiance.”</p>
<p><strong>Israel’s “9/11”</strong></p>
<p>Just as the 9/11 attacks “<a
href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/48602563#:~:text=First%2C%20and%20foundationally%2C%20the%20events,in%20the%20context%20of%20certain">did
not speak for themselves</a>,” neither did Hamas’s attacks on Israel on
October 7, 2023. In remarks at a bilateral meeting with President Biden
11 days later, however, Prime Minister Netanyahu strategically compared
the Hamas attacks to the 9/11 ones, using resonant terms for Americans
that also allowed Israel to claim its own total innocence, as the U.S.
had done 22 years earlier. In that vein, <a
href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/10/18/remarks-by-president-biden-and-prime-minister-netanyahu-of-israel-before-bilateral-meeting-tel-aviv-israel/">Netanyahu
stated,</a> “On October 7th, Hamas murdered 1,400 Israelis, maybe more.
This is in a country of fewer than 10 million people. This would be
equivalent to over 50,000 Americans murdered in a single day. That’s 20
9/11s. That is why October 7th is another day that will live in
infamy.”</p>
<p>But 9/11 doesn’t live in infamy because it actually caused damage of
any long-lasting or ultimate sort to the United States or because it far
exceeded the scale of other acts of global mass violence, but because it
involved “<a
href="https://books.google.com/books/about/American_Exceptionalism_and_American_Inn.html?id=yfFwDwAAQBAJ">Americans
as the victims of terror, not as the perpetrators</a>” and because of
the way those leading the country portrayed it as uniquely and
exceptionally victimized. As Professor Jackson <a
href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17419160500322517">put
it</a>, 9/11 “was immediately iconicized as the foremost symbol of
American suffering.” The ability to reproduce that narrative endlessly,
while transforming 9/11 into a date that transcended time itself, served
as a powerful lesson to Israel in how to communicate suffering and an
omnipresent existential threat that could be weaponized to legitimize
future violent interventions. By framing the Hamas attacks on October
7th similarly as a symbol of ultimate suffering and existential threat,
Israel could do the same.</p>
<p>Giving Israel further license for unfettered state violence under the
guise of a war on terror, in remarks in Tel Aviv President Biden <a
href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/10/18/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-october-7th-terrorist-attacks-and-the-resilience-of-the-state-of-israel-and-its-people-tel-aviv-israel/">stated
that</a> “since this terrorist attack… took place, we have seen it
described as Israel’s 9/11. But for a nation the size of Israel, it was
like 15 9/11s. The scale may be different, but I’m sure those horrors
have tapped into… some kind of primal feeling in Israel, just like it
did and felt in the United States.”</p>
<p>It bears noting that while Israel quickly deployed the rhetoric of
the War on Terror on and after October 7th, weaponizing the language of
terror was not in and of itself novel in that country. For example, in
1986, Benjamin Netanyahu edited and contributed to a collection of
essays called <em>Terrorism: How the West Can Win</em> that spoke to
themes similar to those woven into the U.S. war on terror narrative.
However, in responding to Hamas’s attacks, Israel’s discursive strategy
was both to capitalize on and tether itself to the meanings the U.S. had
popularized and made pervasive about the 9/11 attacks.</p>
<p><strong>“Surprise” Attacks</strong></p>
<p>The power of that “primal feeling” was intensified by the way both
the United States and Israel feigned “surprise” about their countries
being targeted, despite evidence of impending threats both were privy
to. That evidence included a President’s Daily Brief that Bush received
on August 6, 2001, entitled “<a
href="https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB116/pdb8-6-2001.pdf">Bin
Laden Determined to Strike in US</a>,” and the possession by Israeli
officials of <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/30/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-attack-intelligence.html">a
Hamas battle plan document</a> detailing the potential attack a year in
advance.</p>
<p>Just as Bush <a
href="https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/09/20010920-8.html">referred
to</a> the 9/11 attacks as a surprise, <a
href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/discounting-life/0D5158466AB3BF3C36446050D93B12CD">despite
several years of conflict with al-Qaeda and Osama bin Laden</a> (who <a
href="https://www.versobooks.com/products/1952-messages-to-the-world">clearly
stated</a> that U.S. violence in Muslim-majority countries was the
motivation for the attacks), Netanyahu claimed the same after the Hamas
attacks, ignoring Israel’s longtime chokehold on Gaza (and Palestinian
areas of the West Bank). Addressing Israeli citizens on the day of the
attack, Netanyahu <a
href="https://twitter.com/IsraeliPM/status/1710583005230575705?lang=en">asserted
that</a> “we are at war, not in an operation or in rounds, but at war.
This morning, Hamas launched a murderous surprise attack against the
State of Israel and its citizens.”</p>
<p>By portraying terrorism as a grave, unparalleled, and unpredictable
danger, both the United States and Israel framed their brutal wars and
over-responses as necessary actions. Even more problematically, both
tried to evade accountability for future acts by characterizing
themselves as coerced into the wars they then launched. Netanyahu <a
href="https://twitter.com/IsraeliPM/status/1719080837574984042?lang=en">typically
asserted o</a>n October 30th that, “since October 7th, Israel has been
at war. Israel did not start this war. Israel did not want this war. But
Israel will win this war.”</p>
<p>All of these tactics are meant to create and perpetuate “<a
href="https://wrlc-amu.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/fulldisplay?docid=cdi_openaire_primary_doi_90da058776768ae4a7a903e37085758e&amp;context=PC&amp;vid=01WRLC_AMU:prod&amp;lang=en&amp;search_scope=WRLC_P_AU&amp;adaptor=Primo%20Central&amp;tab=WRLC_P_AU&amp;query=any,contains,Security%20%20Democracy%20%20and%20the%20Rhetoric%20of%20Counter-Terrorism">an
extremely narrow set of ’political truths</a>’” (or untruths, if you
prefer). Whether ingrained in the public consciousness by the United
States or Israel, such “truths” were meant to dictate just who the
“terrorists” were (never us, of course), their irrational, barbaric,
uncivilized nature, and so, why intervention — full-scale war, in fact —
was necessary. An additional rhetorical goal was to position the
dominant narrative, whether American or Israeli, as a “<a
href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/narrative-and-the-making-of-us-national-security/796250037A6394BB71A07D197BF5D636">natural
interpretation</a>” of reality, not a constructed one.</p>
<p>Israel has relied on such a framework to consistently peddle a
depoliticized narrative of Hamas, which roots any violence committed in
a fundamental and irrational opposition to the state of Israel and
inherent hatred of the Jewish people as opposed to the longstanding
regime of occupation, apartheid, and now genocide of Palestinians. Hamas
and other non-state actors are, of course, always portrayed as “driven
by fanaticism,” as <a
href="https://www.routledge.com/search?author=Scott%20Poynting">Scott
Poynting</a><a
href="https://www.routledge.com/search?author=Scott%20Poynting">and</a><a
href="https://www.routledge.com/search?author=Scott%20Poynting">David
Whyte note</a>, while state violence, in contrast, is “presented as
defensive, responsible, rational, and unavoidable — and not motivated by
a particular ideological bias or political choice.”</p>
<p><strong>The Threat of Terrorism</strong> <strong>and Moral
Equivalencies</strong></p>
<p>Terrorist violence in these years has regularly been weaponized in
the service of state violence by conceiving of its threat as almost
unimaginably dangerous. Both the United States and Israel have
represented <a
href="https://wrlc-amu.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/fulldisplay?docid=cdi_openaire_primary_doi_90da058776768ae4a7a903e37085758e&amp;context=PC&amp;vid=01WRLC_AMU:prod&amp;lang=en&amp;search_scope=WRLC_P_AU&amp;adaptor=Primo%20Central&amp;tab=WRLC_P_AU&amp;query=any,contains,Security%20%20Democracy%20%20and%20the%20Rhetoric%20of%20Counter-Terrorism">terrorism</a>
as “catastrophic to democracy, freedom, civilization and the American
[or Israeli] way of life,” and “a threat commensurate with Nazism and
Communism.”</p>
<p>As with Bush’s <a
href="https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/09/20010920-8.html#:~:text=We%20have%20seen%20their%20kind,%2C%20and%20Nazism%2C%20and%20totalitarianism.">argument</a>
that the 9/11 attackers were the “heirs of all the murderous ideologies
of the twentieth century” and that “they follow in the path of fascism,
and Nazism, and totalitarianism,” Netanyahu urged a mobilization of
countries across the world to eliminate Hamas on a similar basis. To
this end, he <a
href="https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-prior-meeting-with-prime-minister-benjamin-netanyahu-israel-tel-aviv-israel">asserted
that</a> “just as the civilized world united to defeat the Nazis and
united to defeat ISIS, the civilized world must unite to defeat
Hamas.”</p>
<p>American officials regularly frame U.S. violence as a function of the
country’s inherent goodness and superiority. For example, in September
2006, responding to criticisms of the moral basis for the War on Terror,
Bush <a href="https://innocentuntilprovenmuslim.com/book">said</a> at a
press conference: “If there’s any comparison between the compassion and
decency of the American people and the terrorist tactics of extremists,
it’s flawed logic… I simply can’t accept that. It’s unacceptable to
think that there’s any kind of comparison between the behavior of the
United States of America and the action of Islamic extremists who kill
innocent women and children to achieve an objective.”</p>
<p>By the time Bush made those remarks, the invasions of and wars in
both Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as other “counterterrorism”
operations across the globe, had been underway for years. Given the <a
href="https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/figures/2021/WarDeathToll">staggering
number</a> of civilians already killed, drawing a demarcation line
between the United States and “Islamic extremists” based on the
slaughter of innocent women and children should hardly have been
possible (though when it came to those killed by Americans, the term of
the time was the all-too-dehumanizing “collateral damage”).</p>
<p>No stranger to weaponizing the language of moral equivalencies,
Netanyahu has repeatedly highlighted the victims of Hamas’s attacks in
order to distinguish them from Israel’s. For example, he described Hamas
as “an enemy that murders children and mothers in their homes, in their
beds. An enemy that kidnaps the elderly, kids, youths. Murderers who
massacre and slaughter our citizens, our kids, who just wanted to have
fun on the holiday.” But like the United States, Israel has killed women
and children on a strikingly greater scale than the non-state actors
they were comparing their violence to. In fact, in the last 100 days of
Israel’s war, it is believed to have killed <a
href="https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/gaza-10000-children-killed-nearly-100-days-war">more
than 10,000 children</a> (and those figures will only rise if you
include children who are now likely to <a
href="https://www.commondreams.org/news/gaza-famine">die from</a>
starvation and disease in a devastated Gaza).</p>
<p><strong>Birds of Violent Rhetorical Feathers Flock
Together</strong></p>
<p>In a White House briefing a week after the Hamas attacks, Biden said,
“These guys — they make al-Qaeda look pure. They’re pure — they’re pure
evil.” Then, nearly three weeks after those October 7th attacks, in a
meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, <a
href="https://www.gov.il/en/departments/news/pm-netanyahu-meets-with-french-president-emmanuel-macron-24-oct-2023">Netanyahu</a>
asserted that his country was in “a battle” with “the Axis of Evil led
by Iran, Hezbollah, Hamas, Houthis, and their minions.” More than two
decades earlier, President George W. Bush had <a
href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/onpolitics/transcripts/sou012902.htm#:~:text=States%20like%20these%2C%20and%20their,means%20to%20match%20their%20hatred.">uttered
similar words</a>, referring to Iran, Iraq, and North Korea as an “axis
of evil,” who were “arming to threaten the peace of the world.”</p>
<p>In each case, the “evil” they were referring to was meant to
communicate an inherent and innate desire for violence and destruction,
irrespective of the actions of the United States or Israel. As the
saying goes, evil is as evil does.</p>
<p>As scholar Joanne Esch has <a
href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/20721298">noted</a>, “If they hate us
for who we are rather than what we do, nothing can be gained from
reexamining our own policies.” In other words, no matter what we do, the
United States and Israel can insist on a level of moral superiority in
taking on such battles as the harbingers of good. And it was true that,
positioned as a battle of good versus evil, the all-American war on
terror did, for a time, gain a kind of “<a
href="https://wrlc-amu.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/fulldisplay?docid=cdi_openaire_primary_doi_90da058776768ae4a7a903e37085758e&amp;context=PC&amp;vid=01WRLC_AMU:prod&amp;lang=en&amp;search_scope=WRLC_P_AU&amp;adaptor=Primo%20Central&amp;tab=WRLC_P_AU&amp;query=any,contains,Security%20%20Democracy%20%20and%20the%20Rhetoric%20of%20Counter-Terrorism">divine
sanction</a>,” which Israel has used as a blueprint.</p>
<p>In response to the recent International Court of Justice complaint
submitted by South Africa charging Israel with genocide, a defiant Prime
Minister Netanyahu <a
href="https://twitter.com/IsraeliPM/status/1746277888242897351">tweeted</a>
that his country would continue its Gazan war until it was over. He also
mentioned a meeting he had with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken
in which he told him, “This is not just our war — it is also your
war.”</p>
<p>If Israel’s U.S.-backed genocide of the Palestinians has revealed
anything about the power of discourse, it’s that the war on terror
narrative has proven to be remarkably enduring. This has enabled both
states to make use of specific schemas that were constructed and
deployed in Washington to explain the 9/11 attacks — and now to justify
a genocidal war in a world where “terror” is seen as an eternal threat
to “liberal democracies.”</p>
<p>In his book <a
href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/narrative-and-the-making-of-us-national-security/796250037A6394BB71A07D197BF5D636"><em>Narrative
and the Making of US National Security</em></a>, Donald Krebs argues
that, when it comes to politics, language “neither competes with nor
complements power politics: it is power politics.” In this vein, it
remains critical to subvert such destructive and pervasive narratives so
that countries like the United States and Israel can no longer maintain
“necropolitical” rule domestically or globally — that is, in the words
of Cameroon historian and political theorist <a
href="https://muse.jhu.edu/search?action=search&amp;query=author:J.-A.%20Mbembé:and&amp;min=1&amp;max=10&amp;t=query_term">Achille
Mmembe</a>, “the power and the capacity to dictate who may live and who
must die.”</p>
