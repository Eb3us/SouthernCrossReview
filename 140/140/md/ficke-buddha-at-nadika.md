# BUDDHA AT NADIKA
## by Arthur Davison Ficke

The Buddha came to where the sea\
Curled silver-white upon the land,\
And murmurs of infinity\
Breathed on the sand.\

And there lay shells like rosy foam\
Borne from the caverns of the deep,\
Frail playthings drifted from the home\
Of timeless, tideless sleep.\

And on the sand a Fisher stood\
Drying his nets that late had seen\
The silent caverns of the flood\
And all the wastes between.\

The Fisher lingered in his place\
With countenance of mild surprise,\
And looked upon the Buddha's face\
With dumb uncomprehending eyes.\

And Buddha spake: "Thy nets are drawn,\
Thy boat rocks idle on the sea,\
Thy day turns westward, and is gone . . .\
Come thou with me."\

The Fisher marvelled: "I must toil\
With nets and shells among the caves,\
To win the sea's unwilling spoil\
From the harsh waves."\

And Buddha answered: "Cast no more\
Thy nets upon the troubled sea,\
Nor gather shells along the shore.\
Come thou with me.\

"Thou drawest shells and curious flowers\
From out the blue untrodden caves.\
Thou seest the passing of the hours.\
Thou hearest the clamor of the waves.\

"Thou openest the shell where lies\
The pearl more white than driven spray\
And trackless past thy vision flies\
Each passing day.\

"But I will teach thee not to stir\
The shell nor flower in its sleep.\
For thou shalt roam the sepulchre\
That chasms all their native deep.\

"And vain desire, like terror grown\
Deep in the chambers of thy breast,\
Shall be from thee forever flown,\
And thou shalt rest.\

"No search for pearls shall blind thy thought,\
Nor waves, with clamorous harmonies.\
But in the silence where is naught\
Thou shalt behold the One that is.\

"And where thy days now speed like foan\
Across thy vision, there shall be\
For thee a vast eternal home\
An Infinite Sea."\

The Fisher looked on Buddha dumb\
Looked deep into that tender gaze\
Those eyes within whose depths had come\
And gone the sorrow of all days.\

He looked uncomprehendingly,\
And wearily he shook his head;\
And turned once more to drag the sea,\
Knowing not what the Buddha said.\
