# Love's Been Good To Me
## by Jhonny Cash

I have been a rover\
I have walked alone\
Hiked a hundred highways\
Never found a home\
Still in all I'm happy\
The reason is, you see\
Once in a while along the way\
Love's been good to me

There was a girl in Denver\
Before the summer storm\
Oh, her eyes were tender\
Oh, her arms were warm\
And she could smile away the thunder\
Kiss away the rain\
Even though she's gone away\
You won't hear me complain

I have been a rover\
I have walked alone\
Hiked a hundred highways\
Never found a home\
Still in all I'm happy\
The reason is, you see\
Once in a while along the way\
Love's been good to me

There was a girl in Portland\
Before the winter chill\
We used to go a-courtin'\
Along October hill\
And she could laugh away the dark clouds\
Cry away the snow\
It seems like only yesterday\
As down the road I go

I've been a rover\
I have walked alone\
Hiked a hundred highways\
Never found a home\
Still in all I'm happy\
The reason is, you see\
Once in a while along the way\
Love's been good to me
