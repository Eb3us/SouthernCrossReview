        "At the end of my freshman year of college, back in 1936, I flunked five out of five subjects. Flunking three out of five would have made me eligible to report for an invitation to attend some other college in the fall. But men in this three-out-of-five category sometimes had to wait outside the Dean's office as long as two hours. Men in my group - some of whom had big dates in New York that same night - weren't kept waiting a minute. It went one, two, three, the way most men in my group like things to go.",
        "The particular college I had been attending apparently does not simply mail people's grades home, but prefers to shoot them out of some kind of gun. When I got home to New York, even the butler looked tipped off and hostile. It was a bad night altogether. My father informed me quietly that my formal education was formally over. In a way, I felt like asking for a crack at summer school or something. But I didn't. For one reason, my mother was in the room, and she kept saying that she just knew I should have gone to see my faculty adviser more regularly, that that was what he was there for. This was the kind of talk that made me want to go straight to the Rainbow Room with a friend. At any rate, one thing leading to another, when the familiar moment came to me to advance one of my fragile promises really to apply myself this time, I let it go by unused...",

        "He was in uniform, combat fatigues, with a colt 45 on his belt. Ted and I were in civvies, me covered by a Bogart trench coat and Ted a green German loden overcoat. Two grunts who could barely keep their eyes open were sitting on chairs on either side of the room with M1 rifles between their legs.",

        "In its attempt to swallow Ukraine whole, Russia has so far managed to bite off only the eastern Donbas region and a portion of its southern coast. The rest of the country remains independent, with its capital Kyiv intact. No one knows how this meal will end. Ukraine is eager to force Russia to disgorge what it’s already devoured, while the still-peckish invader clearly has no interest in leaving the table.",
        "This might seem like an ordinary territorial dispute between predator and prey. Ukraine’s central location between east and west, however, turns it into a potentially world-historical conflict like the Battle of Tours when the Christian Franks turned back the surging Ummayad army of Muslims in 732 AD or the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Vietnam in 1975.",
        "The pivotal nature of the current war seems obvious. Ukraine has for some time wanted to join western institutions like the European Union. Russia prefers to absorb Ukraine into its russkiy mir (Russian world). However, this tug of war over the dividing line between East and West isn’t a simple recapitulation of the Cold War. Russian President Vladimir Putin clearly has no interest in reconstituting the Soviet Union, much less in sending his troops westward into Poland or Germany, while the United States isn’t wielding Ukraine as a proxy to fight the Kremlin. Both superpowers have far more circumscribed aims..",

        '<span style="font-style:italic">David Barsamian: Let’s head into the most obvious nightmare of this moment, the war in Ukraine and its effects globally. But first a little background. Let’s start with President George H.W. Bush’s assurance to then-Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev that NATO would not move “one inch to the east” — and that pledge has been verified. My question to you is, why didn’t Gorbachev get that in writing?</span>',
        '<span style="font-style:italic">Noam Chomsky</span>: He accepted a gentleman’s agreement, which is not that uncommon in diplomacy. Shake-of-the-hand. Furthermore, having it on paper would have made no difference whatsoever. Treaties that are on paper are torn up all the time. What matters is good faith. And in fact, H.W. Bush, the first Bush, did honor the agreement explicitly. He even moved toward instituting a partnership in peace, which would accommodate the countries of Eurasia. NATO wouldn’t be disbanded but would be marginalized. Countries like Tajikistan, for example, could join without formally being part of NATO. And Gorbachev approved of that. It would have been a step toward creating what he called a common European home with no military alliances...',

        "In the previous lessons we were concerned with meeting the Guardian of the Threshold. And we must understand this meeting well, to the extent that its earnestness can really occupy our minds. For here we enter an area which is essentially different from other areas of spiritual life, what is called spiritual life by today’s civilization, that is. The encounter with the Guardian of the Threshold is the first thing one experiences when a relationship with the spiritual world truly and earnestly takes place. A relationship with the spiritual world cannot take place without this understanding of the meeting with the Guardian of the Threshold, because the spiritual world is on the other side of this threshold. So when communications are received from the spiritual world, they should be understood as merely in preparation for a relationship with the spiritual world.",

        "Puede parecer extraño incluir una conmemoración del Día de la Muerte de Rudolf Steiner en un boletín que está dedicado a la celebración de la niñez, de las nuevas iniciativas, y de la vida en general, pero incluso en medio de tanta vida el movimiento Waldorf está obligado a afrontar la muerte. Este artículo es un esfuerzo por comprender esta obligación.",
        'El período de seis años que se extendió desde la primavera de 1919 hasta la muerte de Rudolf Steiner, el 29 de marzo de 1925, estuvo lleno de una rápida sucesión de triunfos - y tragedias. Entre las tragedias están los infructuosos esfuerzos por curar las heridas de guerra de Europa mediante la Trimembración Social, el incendio del Primer Goetheanum y la larga y debilitante enfermedad de Steiner. Entre los triunfos se encuentran la refundación de la Sociedad Antroposófica y la poderosa y prolífica producción de las conferencias sobre las relaciones kármicas. Fue durante este período que Rudolf Steiner también ayudó a fundar, nutrir y asesorar lo que él llamaría los "movimientos vástagos", esfuerzos concretos para aplicar los principios espirituales directamente en la sociedad contemporánea. Los movimientos vástagos establecieron vocaciones que hicieron posible un camino único de iniciación moderna. Maestros, médicos, sacerdotes y agricultores ya no tenían que retirarse a centros de misterio o ashrams para desarrollarse espiritualmente, sino que se les proporcionaban los ejercicios meditativos y los retos prácticos que les permitían desplegar sus facultades superiores mientras trabajaban. La pedagogía Waldorf, la medicina antroposófica, la Comunidad de Cristianos y la agricultura biodinámica ya han celebrado, o lo harán pronto, sus cien años, y cada una de ellas tiene sus propias historias de éxito y fracaso. Este artículo se centrará en el papel especial que la pedagogía Waldorf tiene que desempeñar entre sus movimientos hermanos...',
