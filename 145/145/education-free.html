<p class="intro">Any reform decided upon cannot have the desired effect if it does not
get to the root of the problem of education in this country and in the
world: the dependence of educational institutions on the political
state.</p>
<p>If we analyze the evolution of social forms in history, we find three
archetypal elements that constitute an organized society. The State
proper, that is, the bearer of the element of rights.</p>
<p>The sector which we could call cultural, and which encompasses all
manifestations of religion, culture, art and education, since to educate
is precisely to make the contents of culture available to the
learner.</p>
<p>And finally, the sector of economic life, which includes the
processes of production, distribution and consumption of goods and
services.</p>
<p>Although this plan of a social organism seems convincing, it is only
applicable to the present, and this present is a consequence of the
preceding historical evolution. Formerly, in the early epoch of the
evolution of humanity, the social organization started from an
all-embracing theocracy which, from the top of the pyramid, for example
the Egyptian Pharaoh, who ruled as a representative of the divinity and
as a secular lord simultaneously.</p>
<p>In this way, everything was organized and regulated: as much religion
as the relationship between individuals, and between the different
estates, that is to say rights – or lack thereof – and also agricultural
planting and sowing seasons, etc., in other words the Economic aspect.
Examples of this theocracy and its organization can be found throughout
ancient history, in America, and, as remnants of that past, in recent
European history in the absolutist monarchies that derived their
attributes and powers from divine law.</p>
<p>Transformed theocratic impulses still persist In modern times,
replacing divine right as justification for the absolute and
all-encompassing character of the monarchical state with abstract
concepts such as "popular will", "sovereignty", or other abject ones
such as "racial spirit", just to mention a few. However, the function of
the state today consists, in reality, only in guaranteeing legal
equality among people: "the equality of man before the law". This aspect
only emerged in the history of mankind when divine law was replaced by
human law, legislated law, especially in the Roman Empire with the law
that bears its name.</p>
<p>It is only recently, with the birth of industrialization in the West,
that the economic aspect or science has emerged as an independent sector
within society, alongside the science of law. A reflection of all this
evolution can be found in history since the 16th century, when man found
the path to spiritual freedom in religious struggles. In the French
Revolution he sought to secure his juridical equality as a citizen, and
in the social struggles of the twentieth century he sought to define the
character of human relations in economic life, struggles which have not
yet ended, but which are not the subject of this paper.</p>
<p>It should be understood that any of the factors that integrate the
structures of an organized society should be at the service of humanity
and not the latter being of service to them. Neither the structures that
integrate the spiritual-cultural-educational element, nor the State nor
the economy, exist by themselves, but only in function of human beings.
The human being must be considered as such and not as a mere “citizen"
or "producer" or "consumer", because every human being participates at
the same time in the three aspects of social life, and each of these is
governed by the laws that are intrinsic to it.</p>
<p>If the economic sector encroaches on the political state - whether
through its lobbyists, influence in legislative bodies, justice, or in
the administration - "equality before the law" will be violated to the
benefit of economic interests. If economic interests invade the
spiritual-cultural-educational sector, it will not consider the
individual needs of the student, but will organize education according
to its production needs, or it will control research, so it will
<em>not</em> be at the service of the welfare and evolution of humanity,
but of its own enrichment, which is the case today in all the so-called
developed countries.</p>
<p>The result is the plundering of natural resources through the
application of scientific resources, the destruction of the ecological
environment and, in short, the questioning of human survival.</p>
<p>If the political sector is the one that invades the
spiritual-cultural-educational sector, the latter will become an
expression of the struggle for political and ideological power, or,
indirectly, of economic power. Expressions such as "Aryan culture" (in
National Socialism), "popular culture", "national culture", are
manifestations of this invasion, which prevent the emergence of the only
valid element: culture itself, without attachments, this being the free
expression of the spiritual, cultural, artistic and educational
faculties of each individual human being.</p>
<p>From the latter results the only true requirement to educate:
ability, which can only be offered by the community of educators, not by
a ministry or a state secretariat or by any other sector of the
political establishment.</p>
<p>In the course of history it has been necessary for the political
state to take responsibility for education in order to ensure that it is
available to all. This goal has been achieved, and now it is time for
the State to give education its freedom. The State is a political entity
and has its political task, which is to ensure human and civil rights.
Everyone has the right to education and the State must guarantee this
right. However, the State should not control or administer education, a
task that does not fall within its natural sphere and for which it is
incompetent, a fact amply demonstrated by the situation of education in
this country. There is a tendency to look to other countries as models;
in the case of education this outward look does not serve us well. The
sad fact is that education is in the hands of the State all over the
world and world education suffers as a consequence. You may ask: if the
state is not responsible for education, who is? The answer is so simple
as to be obvious: those who educate. And these teachers and professors -
are they in a position to take on this additional task? Perhaps not
immediately, but at least more so than political bureaucrats. After all,
it is they who daily teach children in schools, who best know the
pedagogical and spiritual needs of children because they know them as
real people and not as mere statistical abstractions.</p>
<p>Ability also means knowledge of that to which it is directed, that
is, the student's education. From objective observation and experience,
the educator will extract knowledge of the learner's needs, the only
parameter to determine the method and content of education, and not an
“educational policy", a term that in itself is contradictory and
aberrant.</p>
<p>From all of the above it is clear that in order for the
cultural-spiritual activity to develop organically, an environment of
total freedom from the state-political establishment and from the
economic sector is required. The ideal situation would be for the
teaching staff of each school to run its own institution without a
director. However, if the teaching staff feels that a principal is
necessary, it can choose one of its members to perform this function. In
this way, teachers would grow with their task and would know what
pedagogical methods to apply without being ordered by some minister of
education. It also means, in the case of education, that it should be
detached, administratively and even economically, from the State, and
organized on the basis of self-management, as a totally independent
sector. The self-management or self-government of the educational sector
would be in the hands of those who "know the subject", those who are
qualified, that is to say, <em>the educators</em>.</p>
<p>Each school would form a community of educators, or, perhaps, a
community of educators together with a community of parents, giving rise
to the movement of a school that would determine the education to be
imparted to the children attending it, without the interference of
inspectors, ministries or any other entity belonging to the political
state.</p>
<p>It will be difficult to achieve educational freedom as long as the
state controls finances. Therefore, it may be necessary to change
economic procedure as well. Communal and provincial Autonomous
Educational Commissions may be formed. These commissions, composed of
representatives of the cultural and educational sector of society, will
receive the funds earmarked for education in each locality and
distribute it according to the needs of each school. Where will this
money come from? Basically it is the same money generated by the
country's productive labor that is now diverted through the State and
would instead go directly to the Educational Commissions.</p>
<p>Each community should participate directly in securing the financial
means for education in its locality. This active participation would
awaken the individual and collective creative forces of society. It is
understood that the more economically powerful communities should share
their resources with the less favored ones. This could be coordinated
through regional educational commissions.</p>
<p>It would be ideal that each educational institution be self-financed
in accordance with the idea of fraternity in the economic aspect. Each
parent or student should contribute whatever his situation allows him to
contribute; each teacher would withdraw what his or her needs determine.
In order to solve the economic needs of the schools, we suggest two
possible measures:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a) Everything that the national, provincial or municipal budget
provides for the maintenance of the educational system is automatically
transferred to the autonomous educational sector, which, through its own
administration, freely disposes of those resources, or</p>
<p>b) a voucher is issued for each school-age child, which would be
delivered to the parents, who in turn would deliver such voucher to the
school to which they freely wish to send their children. For its part,
the school would exchange this voucher with the State for funds that the
State receives through taxation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This system (a or b) could be applied to all public schools, which
would be administered by the respective educators, totally detached from
the sphere of the State. The current private schools could continue to
exist, but state subsidies to them should gradually disappear in order
to allow them a healthy autonomous development. This system of
cultural-educational freedom should be applied to the three main levels
of education and teaching, since it is the only one that guarantees the
full development of the creative capacities of the individual, and with
it the basis for the healthy evolution of the social organism of a
nation, of a people.</p>
<p>In our country [Argentina] there is already a precedent for partial
detachment of educational bodies from governmental entities. This is the
university system that allows universities - both state and private - to
dictate their own statutes and govern themselves, without the
intervention of public authorities. This regime has positive ingredients
of spiritual freedom, since it is the university faculties that decide
for themselves their contents and teaching-learning methods, without
being imposed by government officials. But this freedom is only partial,
since government agencies maintain their power to interfere in the
educational activities of state universities, through control of the
financial resources. The state universities depend for their development
and progress on the national budget, so in this sense the negative
influence of the political-state sphere and the economic sphere on
spiritual life is evident.</p>
<p>It should be emphasized that although the economic sphere is
important, the essence of the reform is the liberation of education from
the political state and economic interests alien to the integral
development of the human being. Through true educational freedom, the
spirit of the country can be transformed and a model can be presented to
a world desperately in need of new paths.</p>

Pedagogical Congress studying educational reform in Argentina. Obviously
it was not taken into account.</p>
