<p class="intropoem">My dear friends,</p>
<p>In the previous lessons we were concerned with meeting the Guardian
of the Threshold. And we must understand this meeting well, to the
extent that its earnestness can really occupy our minds. For here we
enter an area which is essentially different from other areas of
spiritual life, what is <em>called</em> spiritual life by today’s
civilization, that is. The encounter with the Guardian of the Threshold
is the first thing one experiences when a relationship with the
spiritual world truly and earnestly takes place. A relationship with the
spiritual world cannot take place without this understanding of the
meeting with the Guardian of the Threshold, because the spiritual world
is on the other side of this threshold. So when communications are
received from the spiritual world, they should be understood as merely
in preparation for a relationship with the spiritual world.</p>
<p>As an example of what we will receive today, my dear friends, I would
like to tell you a story taken from ancient esoteric tradition.</p>
<p>Once upon a time a student was accepted into the mysteries. He
completed the preliminary stages. And when he had achieved a certain
stage of maturity – not that he became what most people nowadays
consider clairvoyant, but he entered into a relationship with the
spiritual world, the relationship where, as far as feeling is concerned,
one correctly receives communications from the spiritual world – the
teacher said to him:</p>
<p>Behold, when I talk to you the words I speak are not human words;
what I have to say is merely clothed in human words. What I have to say
to you are the gods’ thoughts, and these gods’ thoughts are imparted to
you by human words. But it must be clear to you that I am thus appealing
to everything in your soul. You must meet the words which I direct to
you on behalf of the gods with all your thinking, all your feeling, all
your willing. You must receive these words with all your soul’s
enthusiasm, all its inner warmth, all its inner fire. You must receive
them with total alertness, to the limit of your mind’s capacity.</p>
<p>But there is one soul-force in you to which I am not appealing. Your
memory. And I will be satisfied if you do not hold in your memory what I
am now saying to you. I will be satisfied if tomorrow you forget what I
have said today. Because what you usually call your memory, and what
others call your memory, is only meant for earthly things, and not for
godly things. So when you appear before me again tomorrow, and when I
again speak to you, appealing to your thinking, feeling, willing, and to
all your enthusiasm, all your warmth, all your inner fire, to your
mind’s alertness, then these soul forces will be renewed for what is to
be received. Everything should be new and freshly vital the next day,
and the day after, and every day.</p>
<p>I said that I do not appeal to your memory, to your capacity for
remembering. That does not mean that tomorrow you should remember
nothing of what is said to you today. But you should not preserve it in
your memory alone. You should wait an see what your memory makes of it.
What should lead you to me tomorrow in a new attitude, however, should
be your feelings, the innermost feelings of your soul; they should
preserve what is said to you today. For you see, memory, that capacity
for remembrance, is for learning. What the esoteric has to say, however,
is not merely for learning, but for life, and every time it approaches
you it should be relived without the help of memory’s concepts.
[Although there is no indication in the original, this appears to be the
end of the story. Trans.]</p>
<p>It is in fact true that whenever we are dealing with esoteric truths
we should not think: Oh, I know that already. For the essence of the
esoteric does not lie in knowledge, but in direct experience. And
inwardly, in deeper levels of our souls than where memory has its roots,
is where we should grasp and retain the esoteric.</p>
<p>If you reflect on this, my dear friends, it will be of great help in
understanding true esoteric life as we continue. For what must be taken
seriously is that in the moment that we accept the esoteric, our very
understanding of it brings about a different relationship of thinking,
feeling and willing in us than our everyday consciousness is accustomed
to.</p>
<p>For everyday consciousness, thinking, feeling and willing are bound
together. A trivial example may be used to demonstrate how closely bound
together thinking, feeling and willing are in normal consciousness.
Let’s say you know someone, anyone, with whom you had an intimate or a
more distant relationship. The things you experienced with him or her
have been retained in your memory and permeate your feelings. When you
are together with her these things lead you to certain actions in your
behavior towards her. You go on in life with such thoughts and feelings.
One day someone reminds you of this person, says something about her and
your memory is stimulated. If you had loved her, your love is recalled;
if you hated her, your hate is recalled. If you had wanted to undertake
something together with her, this is also recalled. You cannot separate
what you feel and will towards this person with what you think about
her. [In German, the gender of this person is not specified; it is
immaterial. Trans.]</p>
<p>With this kind of attitude it is not possible to understand esoteric
truths correctly. Such truths can only be understood correctly when, for
example, the following happens. You know someone with whom you have a
certain relationship. Certain aspects of this person are most
antipathetic to you. When you are reminded of this person, you can think
of her without the antipathy arising. You can simply think about
her.</p>
<p>It is quite difficult, my dear friends, to just think about your
enemy without letting the animosity towards him arise. One can practice
this with a correct grasp of art. You could ask yourself: Am I able to
exclusively <em>think</em> about certain despicable characters in
Shakespeare’s works? If I were to meet such characters in real life, I
would feel great antipathy towards them. When artistically presented,
however, I can regard them objectively, perhaps just <em>because</em>
they are such excellent villains. This is possible in the artistic area,
for people do not always feel the urge to jump across the footlights and
throttle these Shakespearean villains. It is possible to separate
thinking from feeling in the artistic area.</p>
<p>But in order to be a true esotericist one must also be able to do so
in real life. At the moment when something derived from the esoteric is
said, it must be possible to separate thinking from feeling in this way
in order for it to be absorbed by the soul. For they do not separate on
their own. At first when we think esoteric things, they are so strongly
present within the thoughts, and they are so distant from personal
feelings, that we do not understand them if we do not use pure thinking
to do so. So if we do not wish to listen to the esoteric like couch
potatoes and let everything pass over us with indifference, we must
develop feelings and will-impulses apart from those engendered through
thinking. Such feelings should be developed in order that the esoteric
not remain a cold, icy field, which merely pours through our
understanding, when it should immerse us in the brightest enthusiasm.
But this enthusiasm, this world of feeling, must come from somewhere
else if it does not come from thinking.</p>
<p>For you see, if we want to make our feelings warm in the right way,
we must be clear about the fact that when one speaks correctly from out
of the esoteric, he is speaking from the godly sphere and therefore our
feelings do not encounter thoughts, but realities.</p>
<p>That is why when I gave the first lesson I said that it is the School
that speaks here, that is, the true spirit which goes through the
School, and that it is necessary to realize that the School has not been
born of some personal intention, but that it has been willed and
instated by the spiritual world. If we see it in this way, the School’s
existence will give us the enthusiasm we need.</p>
<p>And then we will understand something else. Yes, my dear friends, in
ordinary life and in ordinary science, we are spoken to in words. And
when we understand the words, the thoughts they are meant to express
come to us because they are contained in the words. The esotericist must
also use words, for he must speak. But he uses words only as a means to
show how the spirit flows toward us in streams and seeks to pour itself
into human hearts.</p>
<p>Therefore it is necessary that in an Esoteric School a sense is
gradually developed to hear beyond the words. And when this sense has
been developed it will be possible to acquire – in respect to the
esoteric – what has been called in esoteric streams of all times with an
attitude of holiness: <em>silence –</em> the silence which preserves
holiness<em>.</em> And this holiness-preserving silence is connected
with something else, without which the esoteric can not further
humanity. It is connected with innermost humility. And without this
innermost humility it is not possible to approach the esoteric. Why?
Well, when we are exhorted to hear beyond the words, it is an appeal to
the innermost essence of our souls, not to our memory. Then our capacity
comes into play, to what extent we are capable of hearing beyond the
words. And it is good for our souls to hear much. But we should not jump
to the conclusion that what dawns in our souls as a result is
necessarily valid and should be relayed to the world. We will need much
time, even when we hear beyond the words, before we come to terms with
ourselves. We should develop the idea that the esoteric must first live
and weave wordlessly in the soul before it can be considered to be
mature enough.</p>
<p>Therefore in the esoteric we must go back from what words mean in
ordinary life to the deeper understanding in the soul. And that is what
I did in the last lesson, my dear friends, when I provided mantric
verses for you, in which scanning is used. The first verse had a
trochaic rhythm, the second an iambic rhythm and the third a spondaic
rhythm. We should feel as though we were descending from the mountain
into the valley with the trochaic rhythm, and we should understand how
this rhythm, which pertains to thinking, can by grasped only when we
feel this descent within the soul. That is why this verse is trochaic,
beginning with a stressed syllable and descending to an unstressed one.
It was meant to instill in us a kind of psychic blood circulation in
spiritual space. We don’t just stand still when such mantras penetrate
our souls, or voice certain thoughts, but we move together with the
spiritual movement of the cosmos, in that human thoughts weave into
human souls. So we learned the first verse, which is related to
thinking:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>See in yourself the weaving thoughts:<br />
Cosmic semblances confront you,<br />
Selfhood as such hides from you;<br />
Plunge beneath the semblances:<br />
Etheric essence flows in you;<br />
Selfhood as such should revere<br />
Guiding beings of your spirit.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, the gods have raised us to themselves by giving us thoughts. And
we descend from the peaks upon which the gods have placed us down into
the valleys, where we encompass and grasp earthly things with these
thoughts.</p>
<p>It is different with feeling. We act correctly if, standing below in
the valley, we wish to ascend with our feelings on a spiritual ladder to
the gods. Feeling puts us in the opposite wave movement: from below to
above. Therefore the mantric verse has an iambic rhythm. It begins with
an unstressed syllable and rises to a stressed one. We should feel
it:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Do hear within the flow of feeling:<br />
When semblance and being within you blend,<br />
Your selfhood tends towards the semblance;<br />
So plunge into what’s seemingly being:<br />
In you the cosmic-psychic forces live;<br />
Your selfhood then should well consider<br />
Your soul’s own vital powers.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>And it’s again different when we come to the will. To do so, we must
be aware that our humanity is split within us. Then we must move close
to the gods in feeling and, halfway there, through feeling’s strength
give birth to the will-impulse. That is only possible if we meditate in
the spondaic, beginning with two stressed syllables:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Let strive in you with thrust of will:<br />
What rises out of semblance-being<br />
With creative self it rises up;<br />
Turn life in full to this<br />
Filled with cosmic-spirit-force;<br />
Your inner self should truly grasp<br />
Creative cosmic power in the spirit-I.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>As I said last time, it is not a question of understanding the
meaning of words, but that we also grasp what lies in the words’
movements and that our souls enter into that movement. In that way we no
longer depend only on ourselves, but we grow into the universe.</p>
<p>Words whose meanings alone are grasped leave us unto ourselves. When
the esoteric is concerned, however, it is a matter of growing together
with the world, that we more and more come out of ourselves. For only
so, by coming out of ourselves, are we able to withstand the separation
of thinking, feeling and willing. Within ourselves, our corporeal “I”
holds thinking, feeling and willing together for everyday consciousness.
Outside, they must be held together by the gods. For this, however, we
must enter the divine being. And we must grow together with the world.
We must learn to develop a sense through which we can say to ourselves
in all honesty and earnestness: Here I have my hand; I contemplate it.
Over there stands a tree; I contemplate it. I contemplate my hand: it is
I. I contemplate the tree: it is I. I contemplate the cloud: it is I. I
contemplate the rainbow: it is I. I contemplate the thunder: it is I. I
contemplate the lightning: it is I. I feel myself one with the
world.</p>
<p>Abstractly, meaning dishonestly, this is easy to achieve. Concretely,
meaning honestly, one must overcome many inner aspects. If, however, one
does not shy away from overcoming these things, the desired goal will be
achieved. For the question the esotericist must ask himself is: I
contemplate my hand; it belongs to me. What would my life – which began
a few decades ago – have become if I didn’t have the hand? It is
necessary for all I have become. But the tree: it is as it stands before
us today – its conception originally from the Ancient Moon – grown out
of the whole earth organism. What was present in the Ancient Moon
organism could not have existed had the conception of the tree not been
developed. But at that time the conception of my thinking also arose. If
the tree didn’t exist, I would not be thinking today. My hand is only
necessary for my present earthly existence. The tree is necessary in
order that I can be a thinking being. Why should the hand be worth more
to me than the tree? Why should I reckon the hand more to my physicality
than the tree? Little by little I am able to realize that what I call
the outer world is much more my inner world than what I considered to be
the interior of my physicality in this incarnation. To feel this deeply
and sincerely must be learned.</p>
<p>So today we will consider three verses, mantric verses, through which
this <em>feeling-one</em> with the whole so-called “outer being” can
gradually penetrate deeply into the soul.</p>
<p>What is our attitude initially towards outer being? We look down at
the earth. We feel dependent on this earth; it gives us what we need to
live. We look into space. The sun rises in the morning; it goes down in
the evening; its light streams across the earth; it comes from afar, it
goes afar. We look up at night: the heavenly sky speaks mysteriously to
us. In this threefold gaze our relationship to the world is determined.
I look downward, I look out afar, I look upward. But let us do this with
intensive consciousness, let us do it as indicated in the following
mantric verses:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Feel how the earth’s depths<br />
Press its forces in your being,<br />
In the members of your body.<br />
You lose yourself in them,<br />
If you entrust powerless<br />
Your will to their striving.<br />
Darkly eclipsed will be your I.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>[These lines are written on the blackboard.]</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Feel how the earth’s depths</em><br />
<em>Press its forces in your being,</em><br />
<em>In the members of your body.</em><br />
<em>You lose yourself in them,</em></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>- in the forces -</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>If you entrust powerless</em><br />
<em>Your will to their striving.</em><br />
<em>Darkly eclipsed will be your I.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>You see, my dear friends, we do not consciously relate what binds us
to the earth with our own humanity. We look down at the earth, knowing
that crystals are formed in it, knowing that it moves through space,
that it exerts a force of gravity, that it attracts the stone that falls
to earth, knowing that it attracts even us. We think about all this.
What we don’t think about are the urges, instincts, cravings and
passions that live in us, what we ascribe to lower human nature, and
which also belong to the earth. When we look down and ask what the earth
causes in us, we should remember: something exists in us, created by the
earth, which would drag us down below the human level, which would
darken our I, which would push us into the subhuman region. We must be
aware that we are so bound to the earth that, despite all its beauty and
majesty that spreads over its surface, for us humans the downward force
is at the same time a sub-humanizing force. By honestly recognizing this
we develop into true human beings.</p>
<p>Then we will be able to not only look downward in our development,
but also to look afar in the distance at our own height and to see what
surrounds the earth on all sides and describes our humanity within a
circle. Thus something begins physically, which to a certain extent
lifts us above the downward pulling earthly forces. Through the downward
pulling earthly forces man can become evil; but not so easily through
the breath, which also belongs to what encircles the earth. And even
less through the light which the sun lets encircle the earth. We
consider breath and light as things that have no spiritual importance.
But gods live in breath and light. And we must be aware that godly
forces are especially active in light and, because they pass through us
humans, act differently than the deep earthly forces.</p>
<p>This brings the second mantric verse to our consciousness:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Feel how from cosmic distance</em><br />
<em>Godly forces let their spirit-light</em><br />
<em>Shine into your psychic being.</em><br />
<em>Find yourself in them loving,</em><br />
<em>And they creating, wisdom weaving</em><br />
<em>You as self in their circles</em><br />
<em>Strong for spiritual works of good.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>We are not always aware that we can love what flows over our earth as
light, be it sunlight or starlight. But we are aware that we can love
the sunlight, love it as warmly as a friend, then we also learn how gods
in garments of light circle round the earth. Then the opinion that
sunlight is merely what illuminates the earth changes for good; sunlight
becomes the garment of the gods. And the gods wander over the earth in
shining garments. And what we experience from the light becomes wisdom.
The gods bring their wisdom to our hearts, into our souls. And now,
because of this differentiation in feelings, we have ascended
higher.</p>
<p>First we developed the appropriate feelings in respect to the deep
earthly forces. We sensed correctly the part of our humanity that
belongs to the deep earthly forces. Then we raised ourselves to that
higher part of our humanity which belongs to the godly beings in shining
garments moving over the earth, who do not wish to leave man in the
earthly sphere but, even while he is walks on the earth, raise him to
their spheres, so that when he passes through the gates of death, he can
continue to walk in them. For the gods do not want to leave us alone on
earth, but want to bring us into their spheres. They want to make us
into beings who live among them. The deep earth forces want to separate
us from the godly forces.</p>
<p>Therefore, a previous mantra communicated to you:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The first beast’s bony spirit:<br />
The will’s evil creative power,<br />
Which would estrange your own body<br />
From the soul’s inherent strength<br />
And devote it to the counter-forces,<br />
Which would steal in future time<br />
Cosmic being from the gods.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>We must, however, also feel this when we are in the world and feel
ourselves to be one with the world.</p>
<p>But we have not yet reached our full humanity in consciousness if we
cannot look upward. We must gaze into the depths, we must gaze into the
distance, we must gaze into the heights. From everyday consciousness
which mixes the depth, the distant and the height, we must differentiate
depth-consciousness, distant-consciousness, height-consciousness.</p>
<p>[The third verse is written on the blackboard.]</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Feel how in heaven’s heights</em><br />
<em>Selfhood can selflessly exist</em></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>We can feel that we are gazing up into the heights with full
consciousness. Think, my dear friends, about standing outside in a field
looking up at a star-bedecked sky. It becomes clearer when we have the
opportunity to choose; it can also happen in daylight, but it is clearer
at night. We feel at one with the world; we feel: that is you. But the
point on earth we stand on, which we consider to be so important that it
only encompasses our individual self, dissolves when we gaze up into
space. It expands to the hemisphere. If we do this in the right way,
then narrow selfhood ends and becomes selfless, for it is infinitely
expanded in the heights of space:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Feel how in heaven’s heights<br />
Selfhood can selflessly exist,</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>[writing continues.]</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>If spirit-filled force of thought</em><br />
<em>Follows striving in the heights</em></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Who really feels how the gods in shining garments move around the
earth with the steaming sunlight and with every breath breathes in and
breathes out of the human soul, and who gazes skywards feeling selfless
in his selfhood, is soon able to also develop the distance of space
within. The following lines are pertinent:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Feel how in heaven’s heights<br />
Selfhood can selflessly exist,<br />
If spirit-filled force of thought<br />
Follows striving in the heights</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>[writing continues.]</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>And with courage hears the words</em><br />
<em>Gracefully intoning from above</em><br />
<em>Into man’s genuine being.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The heights are speaking. And just as we can grow in love together
with the gods who move around the earth in shining garments, we can also
grow together with the words resounding from the heights, if we develop
the capacity to strive together with the forces of thinking in the
heavenly heights.</p>
<p>But, my dear friends, you will only be able to correctly achieve
these inner feelings, which convert your consciousness to a depth,
spatial and heights-consciousness, if you make the corresponding verses
[about the third, second and first beasts] so deep and visible for your
souls as contrasted with these verses [the three verses on the
blackboard].</p>
<p>You come before the Guardian of the Threshold. Living thought-images
about it should be active in your minds. The Guardian of the Threshold
shows you the third beast of which we spoke in the previous lesson. What
this beast characterizes resounds within you:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The third beast’s glassy eye,<br />
Is the evil counterpart<br />
Of thinking, that denies itself<br />
In you and chooses death,<br />
Forsaking the spirit-force<br />
which before it’s earthly life<br />
Lived its life in fields of spirit.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>It is what draws us downward. We escape from it by saying with inner
courage:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Feel how the earth’s depths<br />
Press its forces in your being,<br />
In the members of your body.<br />
You lose yourself in them,<br />
If you entrust powerless<br />
Your will to their striving.<br />
Darkly eclipsed will be your I.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>At first glance there seems to be little difference between looking
at the beast and what liberates you from it. Both mantras sound similar
in that they both characterize the drawing under, except that one
specifically describes the beast, while the other indicates
watchfulness.</p>
<p>But let us go on to the second beast and take what rescues us from
it; place both mantric verses alongside each other: the mood is
completely different. In one the gruesome description of the second
beast, in the other an appeal to the gods who approach us in shining
garments. And we hear these two mantric verses alongside each other, how
different their styles are:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The second beast’s mocking countenance<br />
Is the evil counter-force of feeling,<br />
Which hollows out its own soul<br />
And creates an empty life<br />
Instead of fullness of spirit<br />
With light from the force of the sun<br />
Before your earthly existence.</p>
<p>Feel how from cosmic distance<br />
Godly forces let their spirit-lig Shine into your psychic being.<br />
Find yourself in them loving,<br />
And they creating, wisdom weaving<br />
You as self within their circles<br />
Strong for spiritual works of good.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Because we begin by describing the third beast, we must place
ourselves, as in this mantric verse [Feel how the earth’s depths…], next
to the third beast. At first we can not free ourselves, we are only
prompted to be aware of where the beast wants to lead us. When we turn
to the second beast, and the helping mantric verse [Feel how from cosmic
distance…], the verse is already able to lead us far away from the beast
whose ghastliness is characterized by its mocking face.</p>
<p>And when we approach the first beast, which wants to hinder us from
hallowing our humanity by gazing up to the heavenly heights, and how we
can escape in our innermost being from this beast, if we turn to the
mantric verse which leads us upwards to the heavenly heights:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The first beast’s bony spirit:<br />
The will’s evil creative power,<br />
Which would estrange your own body<br />
From the soul’s inherent strength<br />
And devote it to the counter-forces,<br />
Which would steal in future time<br />
Cosmic being from the gods.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>And yet: As though we wished to burn up all that this verse says and
lift ourselves up in flame, the other verse exists – comforter and
grace-giving as opposed to what the first beast is, by means of our own
courageous soul-force:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Feel how in heaven’s heights<br />
Selfhood can selflessly exist,<br />
If spirit-filled force of thought<br />
Follows striving in the heights<br />
And with courage hears the words<br />
Gracefully intoning from above<br />
Into man’s genuine being.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>You see, the last time we saw that we practice an inner rhythm when
we integrate our own being into the shining light-being of the world, so
today we must recognize how the esoteric things which we are learning
have an inner connection, so that we must always go back to the previous
elements – not only in respect to the meaning of the words, which remain
earthly, but to the inner disposition. And this disposition, this mood,
comes both from the whole and from the details.</p>
<p>Take for example the first verse: “Feel how the earth’s depths”. Here
we are directed to the earth’s depths. And the other verse directs us to
“ The third beast’s glassy eye”. They belong together.</p>
<p>In the second verse “Feel how from cosmic distance”: We feel how the
gods approach in shining garments. Here we are raised up – if we can
really feel it – and away from what mocks the divine in the world. “The
second beast’s mocking countenance” is truly wiped away by radiant
sunshine, if we wish to grasp “radiant sunshine” spiritually.</p>
<p>And the third verse, which begins: “The first beast’s bony spirit”
ossifies us. We become warm if we are freed from the ossification by
gazing at the heavenly heights. So we can also say:</p>
<p>When you see the third beast’s glassy eye, stand firm and feel what
the earth’s depths want from you.</p>
<p>When you see the second beast’s mocking face, lovingly receive the

<p>When you feel ossified by the first beast’s bony spirit, warm
yourself as a human being by raising your heart warmly to heaven’s
heights.</p>
<p>Thus we shall gradually feel our way into spiritual life, and this
spiritual life will grow ever more closely related to our soul.</p>

<p>My dear friends, it is necessary to add something, because the School
must be taken seriously, and what I said that Wednesday about its
conditions must be taken seriously. So I have been obliged to withdraw
the membership card from a person who, by neglecting to do what is
necessary on duty here, could have caused a great misfortune. I mention
this here because I wish to show that the intentions indicated during
the Christmas Meeting must be taken seriously. And I request that in the
future this should not be understood as a mere manner of speaking, if
the fact that this Esoteric School is desired in all earnestness by the
spiritual world is deemed valid, and in the moment when someone does not
want to be a representative of the anthroposophical movement in the
right way, the School must reserve the right to withdraw his membership
card. I wish to indicate in all earnestness that the membership card had
to be withdrawn from a person – at least for a period of time, until
that person shows by his attitude that the opposite is the case. We will
grow into the School in the right way if we reject all the flippant
views about the anthroposophical movement which have brought so much
mischief into the movement. We must grow into the esoteric in full
earnestness. And I must say here again that what was meant in the
Christmas Meeting has not been understood by everyone. But the School’s
leadership will be alert and will take the School seriously. Let us bear
this in mind as part of today’s lesson.</p>
