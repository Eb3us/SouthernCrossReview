<p class="intro">In its attempt to swallow Ukraine whole, Russia has so far managed to
bite off only the eastern Donbas region and a portion of its southern
coast. The rest of the country remains independent, with its capital
Kyiv intact.</p>
<p>No one knows how this meal will end. Ukraine is eager to force Russia
to disgorge what it’s already devoured, while the still-peckish invader
clearly has <a
href="https://fpif.org/a-just-ceasefire-or-just-a-ceasefire/">no
interest</a> in leaving the table.</p>
<p><span id="anchor"></span>This might seem like an ordinary territorial
dispute between predator and prey. Ukraine’s central location between
east and west, however, turns it into a potentially world-historical
conflict like the Battle of Tours when the Christian Franks turned back
the surging Ummayad army of Muslims in 732 AD or the withdrawal of U.S.
forces from Vietnam in 1975.</p>
<p>The pivotal nature of the current war seems obvious. Ukraine has for
some time wanted to join western institutions like the European Union.
Russia <a
href="http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/66181">prefers to
absorb</a> Ukraine into its <em>russkiy mir</em> (Russian world).
However, this tug of war over the dividing line between East and West
isn’t a simple recapitulation of the Cold War. Russian President
Vladimir Putin clearly has no interest in reconstituting the Soviet
Union, much less in sending his troops westward into Poland or Germany,
while the United States isn’t wielding Ukraine as a proxy to fight the
Kremlin. Both superpowers have far more circumscribed aims.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the war has oversized implications. What at first glance
seems like a spatial conflict is also a temporal one. Ukraine has the
great misfortune to straddle the fault line between a twentieth century
of failed industrial strategies and a possible twenty-first century
reorganization of society along clean-energy lines.</p>
<p>In the worst-case scenario, Ukraine could simply be absorbed into the
world’s largest petro-state. Or the two sides could find themselves in a
punishing stalemate that <a
href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/06/15/ukraine-war-russia-grain-food-crisis-world-hunger/">cuts
off the world’s hungriest</a> from vast stores of grain and continues to
distract the international community from pushing forward with an
urgently needed reduction of carbon emissions. Only a decisive defeat of
<a href="https://fpif.org/no-pasaran-ukraine-2022/">Putinism</a> — with
its toxic mix of despotism, corruption, right-wing nationalism, and
devil-may-care extractivism — would offer the world some sliver of hope
when it comes to restoring some measure of planetary balance.</p>
<p>Ukraine is fighting for its territory and, ultimately, its survival.
The West has come to its aid in defense of international law. But the
stakes in this conflict are far more consequential than that.</p>
<p><strong>What Putin Wants</strong></p>
<p>Once upon a time, Vladimir Putin was a conventional Russian
politician. Like many of his predecessors, he enjoyed a complicated
<em>ménage à trois </em>with democracy (the boring spouse) and despotism
(his true love). He toggled between confrontation and cooperation with
the West. Not a nationalist, he presided over a multiethnic federation;
not a populist, he didn’t care much about playing to the masses; not an
imperialist, he deployed brutal but limited force to keep Russia from
spinning apart.</p>
<p>He also understood the limits of Russian power. In the 1990s, his
country had suffered a precipitous decline in its economic fortune, so
he worked hard to rebuild state power on what lay beneath his feet.
Russia, after all, is the world’s <a
href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/3/17/infographic-how-much-of-your-countrys-gas-comes-from-russia-interactive">largest
exporter</a> of natural gas, its second-largest <a
href="https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/oil-producing-countries">oil
producer</a>, and its third-<a
href="https://www.statista.com/chart/20587/biggest-coal-exporters/">largest
coal exporter</a>. Even his efforts to prevent regions from slipping
away from the Russian sphere of influence were initially constrained. In
2008, for instance, he <a
href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/16/opinions/putin-georgia-ukraine-war-mitchell/index.html">didn’t
try</a> to take over neighboring Georgia, just force a stalemate that
brought two breakaway regions into the Russian sphere of influence.</p>
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1642594644/ref=nosim/?tag=tomdispatch-20"><div class="polaroid"><img class="b" src="songlands_cover.png" alt="Songlands book cover" style="width:100%"><div class="container"><p>Buy the Book!</p></div></div></a>
<p>Meanwhile, Putin pursued strategies aimed at weakening his perceived
adversaries. He ratcheted up cyberattacks <a
href="https://warsawinstitute.org/baltic-states-versus-russian-hybrid-threats/">in
the Baltics</a>, expanded maritime provocations <a
href="https://carnegieendowment.org/2021/05/20/what-is-russia-doing-in-black-sea-pub-84549">in
the Black Sea</a>, advanced <a
href="https://carnegieendowment.org/2021/03/29/russia-in-arctic-critical-examination-pub-84181">aggressive
territorial claims</a> in the Arctic, and supported right-wing
nationalists like France’s Marine Le Pen and Italy’s Matteo Salvini to
undermine the unity of the European Union. In 2016, he even attempted to
further polarize American politics via <a
href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/10/01/how-russia-helped-to-swing-the-election-for-trump">dirty
tricks</a> in support of Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Always sensitive to challenges to his own power, Putin watched with
increasing concern as “color revolutions” spread through parts of the
former Soviet Union — from Georgia (2003) and Ukraine (2005) to Belarus
(2006) and Moldova (2009). Around the time of the 2013-2014 Euromaidan
protests in Ukraine, he <a
href="https://ips-dc.org/report-battle-for-another-world-progressive-response-to-new-right/">began
shifting</a> domestically to a nationalism that prioritized the
interests of ethnic Russians, while cracking down <a
href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-60878663">ferociously</a> on
dissent and <a
href="https://www.businessinsider.com/russia-assassination-abroad-2017-6">ramping
up</a> attacks on critics abroad. An intensifying sense of paranoia led
him to <a
href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/31/russias-putin-is-so-powerful-everyone-is-scared-to-tell-him-the-truth.html">rely
on</a> an ever-smaller circle of advisors, ever less likely to
contradict him or offer him bad news.</p>
<p>In the early 2020s, facing disappointment abroad, Putin effectively
gave up on preserving even a semblance of good relations with the United
States or the European Union. Except for Viktor Orbán in Hungary, the
European far right had proven a complete disappointment, while his
fair-weather friend Donald Trump had lost the 2020 presidential
election. Worse yet, European countries seemed determined to meet their
Paris climate accord commitments, which sooner or later would mean
radically reducing their dependence on Russian fossil fuels.</p>
<p>In contrast to China’s eagerness to stay on good terms with the
United States and Europe, Putin’s Russia began turning its back on
centuries of “westernizing” impulses to embrace its Slavic history and
traditions. Like North Korea’s Kim Jong-un and India’s Narendra Modi,
Putin decided that the only ideology that ultimately mattered was
nationalism, in his case a particularly virulent, anti-liberal form of
it.</p>
<p>All of this means that Putin will pursue his aims in Ukraine
regardless of the long-term impact on relations with the West. He’s
clearly <a
href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/06/03/russia-putin-economy-attrition-war/">convinced</a>
that political polarization, economic sclerosis, and a wavering security
commitment to that embattled country will eventually force Western
powers to accommodate a more assertive Russia.</p>
<p>He might not be wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Whither the West?</strong></p>
<p>Since the invasion of Ukraine, the West has never seemed more
unified. Even previously neutral Finland and Sweden <a
href="https://fpif.org/russia-nato-and-the-future-of-neutrality/">have
lined up</a> to join NATO, while the United States and much of Europe
have largely agreed when it comes to sanctions against Russia.</p>
<p>Still, all is not well in the West. In the United States, where
Trumpism continues to metastasize within the Republican Party, 64% of
Americans are convinced that democracy is “in crisis and at risk of
failing,” according to a <a
href="https://www.npr.org/2022/01/03/1069764164/american-democracy-poll-jan-6">January
NPR/Ipsos poll</a>. Meanwhile, in a surprising <a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/05/us-threat-democracy-russia-china-global-poll">Alliance
of Democracies Foundation poll</a> last year, 44% of respondents in 53
countries rated the United States, a self-proclaimed beacon of liberty,
as a greater threat to democracy than either China (38%) or Russia
(28%).</p>
<p>In Europe, the far right continues to challenge the democratic
foundations of the continent. Uber-Christian Viktor Orbán recently won
his fourth term as Hungary’s prime minister; the super-conservative Law
and Justice Party is firmly at the helm in Poland; the anti-immigrant,
Euroskeptical Swiss People’s Party remains the most significant force in
that country’s parliament; and the top three far-right political parties
in Italy together attract <a
href="https://www.politico.eu/europe-poll-of-polls/italy/">nearly
50%</a> in public opinion polls.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the global economy, still on neo-liberal autopilot, has
jumped out of the pandemic frying pan into the fires of stagflation.
With stock markets heading into bear territory and a global recession
looming, the World Bank <a
href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/06/07/world-bank-global-growth-forecast-stagflation/">recently
cut</a> its 4.1% growth forecast for 2022 to 2.9%. The Biden
administration’s perceived failure to address inflation may deliver
Congress to Republican extremists this November and social democratic
leaders throughout Europe may pay a similar political price for <a
href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/31/euro-zone-inflation-hits-yet-another-record-high-as-food-and-energy-prices-soar.html">record-high
Eurozone inflation</a>. </p>
<p>Admittedly, the continued military dominance of the United States and
its NATO allies would seem to refute all rumors of the decline of the
West. In reality, though, the West’s military record hasn’t been <a
href="https://warontherocks.com/2019/08/the-myth-of-american-military-dominance/">much
better</a> than Russia’s performance in Ukraine. In August 2021, the
United States ignominiously withdrew its forces from its 20-year war in
Afghanistan as the Taliban surged back to power. This year, France <a
href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/africa/sahel/mali/frances-troop-withdrawal-mali">pulled
its troops</a> from Mali after a decade-long failure to defeat al-Qaeda
and Islamic State militants. Western-backed forces failed to dislodge
Bashar al-Assad in Syria or prevent a horrific civil war from enveloping
Libya. All the trillions of dollars devoted to achieving “full-spectrum
dominance” couldn’t produce enduring success in Iraq or Somalia, <a
href="https://fpif.org/u-s-counterterrorism-in-africa-has-failed-whats-the-alternative/">wipe
out terrorist factions</a> throughout Africa, or effect regime change in
North Korea or Cuba.</p>
<p>Despite its overwhelming military and economic power, the West no
longer seems to be on the same upward trajectory as after the collapse
of the Soviet Union. Back in the 1990s, Eastern Europe and even parts of
the former Soviet Union signed up to join NATO and the European Union.
Russia under Boris Yeltsin inked a partnership agreement with NATO,
while both <a
href="https://www.rips.or.jp/en/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/RIPS_Policy_Perspectives_No.2.pdf">Japan</a>
and South Korea were interested in pursuing a proposed global version of
that security alliance.</p>
<p>Today, however, the West seems increasingly irrelevant outside its
own borders. China, love it or hate it, has rebuilt its Sinocentric
sphere in Asia, while becoming the most important economic player in the
Global South. It’s even established alternative global financial
institutions that, one day, might replace the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) and World Bank. Turkey has turned its back on the European
Union (and vice versa) and Latin America is heading in a more
independent <a
href="https://www.realinstitutoelcano.org/en/work-document/is-latin-america-part-of-the-west/">direction</a>.
Consider it a sign of the times that, when the call went out to sanction
Russia, most of the non-Western world <a
href="https://fpif.org/the-universality-of-ukraine/">ignored it</a>.</p>
<p>The foundations of the West are indeed increasingly unstable.
Democracy is no longer, as scholar Francis Fukuyama <a
href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/24027184">imagined</a> it in the late
1980s, the inevitable trajectory of world history. The global economy,
while spawning inexcusable inequality and being upended by the recent
pandemic, is exhausting the resource base of the planet. Both right-wing
extremism and garden-variety nationalism are eroding the freedoms that
safeguard liberal society. It’s no surprise, then, that Putin believes a
divided West will ultimately accede to his aggression.</p>
<p><strong>The Ukraine Pivot</strong></p>
<p>There’s never a good time for war.</p>
<p>But hostilities have flared in Ukraine just as the world was supposed
to be accelerating its transition to a clean-energy future. In another
three years, carbon emissions <a
href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/04/ipcc-report-mitigation-climate-change/">must
hit their peak</a> and, in the next eight years, countries must cut
their carbon emissions <a
href="https://unric.org/en/new-ipcc-report-emissions-can-be-halved-by-2030/">by
half</a> if there’s any hope of meeting the goals of the Paris climate
accord by 2050. Even before the current war, the <a
href="https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021">most
comprehensive estimate</a> put the rise in global temperature at a
potentially disastrous 2.7 degrees Celsius by the end of the century
(nearly twice the 1.5 degree goal of that agreement).</p>
<p>The war in Ukraine is propelling the world full tilt in the opposite
direction. China and India are, in fact, <a
href="https://www.sustainable-carbon.org/the-war-in-ukraine-has-stalled-global-efforts-to-cut-emissions/">increasing</a>
their use of coal, the worst possible fossil fuel in terms of carbon
emissions. Europe is desperate to replace Russian oil and natural gas
and countries like Greece are now considering increasing their own
production of dirty energy. In a similar fashion, the United States is
once again <a
href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/03/31/fact-sheet-president-bidens-plan-to-respond-to-putins-price-hike-at-the-pump/">boosting</a>
oil and gas production, <a
href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/31/us-to-release-1-million-barrels-of-oil-per-day-from-reserves-to-help-cut-gas-prices.html">releasing
supplies</a> from its Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and hoping to
persuade oil-producing nations to pump yet more of their product into
global markets.</p>
<p>With its invasion, in other words, Russia has helped to derail the
world’s already faltering effort at decarbonization. Although last fall
Putin <a
href="https://fpif.org/russian-green-deal-light-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel/">committed</a>
his country to a net-zero carbon policy by 2060, phasing out fossil
fuels now would be economic suicide given that he’s done so little to
diversify the economy. And despite international sanctions, Russia has
been making a killing with fossil-fuel sales, <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/13/climate/russia-oil-gas-record-revenue.html">raking
in a record $97 billion</a> in the first 100 days of battle.</p>
<p>All of this could suggest, of course, that Vladimir Putin represents
the last gasp of the failed petropolitics of the twentieth century. But
don’t count him out yet. He might also be the harbinger of a future in
which technologically sophisticated politicians continue to pursue their
narrow political and regional aims, making it ever less possible for the
world to survive climate change.</p>
<p>Ukraine is where Putin is making his stand. As for Putinism itself —
how long it lasts, how persuasive it proves to be for other countries —
much depends on China.</p>
<p>After Putin’s invasion, Beijing could have given full-throated
support to its ally, promised to buy all the fossil fuels Western
sanctions left stranded, provided military equipment to buoy the
faltering Russian offensive, and severed its own ties with Europe and
the United States. Beijing could have broken with international
financial institutions like the World Bank and the IMF in favor of the
New Development Bank and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, its
own multinational organizations. In this way, Ukraine could have turned
into a genuine proxy war between East and West.</p>
<p>Instead, China has been <a
href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/06/02/china-support-russia-ukraine/">playing
both sides</a>. Unhappy with Putin’s unpredictable moves, including the
invasion, which have disrupted China’s economic expansion, it’s also
been disturbed by the sanctions against Russia that similarly cramp its
style. Beijing isn’t yet strong enough to challenge the hegemony of the
dollar and it also remains dependent on Russian fossil fuels. Now the
planet’s <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-57018837">greatest
emitter</a> of greenhouse gases, China has been building a tremendous
amount of renewable energy infrastructure. Its wind sector <a
href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-19/two-charts-that-show-china-is-as-reliant-as-ever-on-fossil-fuels#:~:text=China%20remains%20as%20tied%20as,hit%20net%2Dzero%20by%202060.">generated
nearly 30%</a> more power in 2021 than the year before and its solar
sector increased by nearly 15%. Still, because of a growing appetite for
energy, its overall dependence on coal and natural gas has hardly been
reduced. </p>
<p>Reliant as it is on Russian energy imports, China won’t yet pull the
plug on Putinism, but Washington could help push Beijing in that
direction. It was once a dream of the Obama administration to partner
with the world’s second-largest economy <a
href="https://www.energy.gov/ia/initiatives/us-china-clean-energy-research-center-cerc">on
clean energy projects</a>. Instead of focusing as it has on myriad ways
to contain China, the Biden administration could offer it a green
version of an older <a
href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-united-states-and-china-a-g-2-in-the-making/">proposal</a>
to create a Sino-American economic duopoly, this time focused on making
the global economy sustainable in the process. The two countries could
<a
href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal_en">join
Europe</a> in advancing a Global Green Deal.</p>
<p>In recent months, President Biden has been willing to entertain the
previously unthinkable by mending fences <a
href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/05/17/venezuela-oil-sanctions-chevron/">with
Venezuela</a> and <a
href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/06/15/joe-biden-saudi-arabia-trip-bin-salman-00039679">Saudi
Arabia</a> in order to flood global markets with yet more oil and so
reduce soaring prices at the pump. Talk about twentieth-century
mindsets. Instead, it’s time for Washington to consider an eco-détente
with Beijing that would, among other things, drive a stake through the
heart of Putinism, safeguard Ukraine’s sovereignty, and stop the planet
from burning to a crisp.</p>
<p>Otherwise, we know how this unhappy meal will end — as a Last Supper
for humanity.</p>
