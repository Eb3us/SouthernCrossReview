<p class="intro"><strong>Look lieutenant</strong>, we’re part of the intelligence
cadre of this operation. We briefed you guys day before yesterday.
Weren’t you there? I mean you can’t interrogate us. Well, you could, but
what’s the point? Besides, it’s late.</p>
<p>The young officer looked at Ted Jung and me with tired eyes. It was
late. And what <em>was</em> the point? he must have been thinking.</p>
<p>Okay, he said. I’m putting in the log that we captured two members of
the local underground who confessed after a relatively short but hard
interrogation; they also gave the names of other collaborators. How’s
that sound?</p>
<p>He was in uniform, combat fatigues, with a colt 45 on his belt. Ted
and I were in civvies, me covered by a Bogart trench coat and Ted a
green German loden overcoat. Two grunts who could barely keep their eyes
open were sitting on chairs on either side of the room with M1 rifles
between their legs.</p>
<p>Sounds good, I said.</p>
<p>Good. What are their names? And what are your names?</p>
<p>We don’t not know nutting, Ted said.</p>
<p>The lieutenant shot a killing glance at Ted and the grunts woke
up.</p>
<p>He’s kidding, sir, I said. Don’t pay any attention. Er…my name’s
Arnold Schiklegruber and he’s Hans Henkel. The chief of the underground
is Eric Marie Remarck and his concubine is Eva Braun. You got a beer or
something? We’re dying of thirst.</p>
<p>Address? he asked, ignoring our thirst.</p>
<p>Hauptstrasse 7, Bad Kreuznach.</p>
<p>Is that Remarck’s address or yours?</p>
<p>We all live together, I said. Ted snickered.</p>
<p>The Lt. was filling out a form. He turned the page. Now tell me what
happened.</p>
<p>What happened? You mean as though we were really the underground?</p>
<p>Of course. I have to write up what you confessed. And hurry up, it’s
late.</p>
<p>Can we at least sit down? Ted said.</p>
<p>Sit.</p>
<p>Where?</p>
<p>Bring in a couple of chairs, he told one of the grunts. Not too
comfortable.</p>
<p>The grunt looked mortally offended, handed his M1 to the other one
and slouched toward the door.</p>
<p>And bring a couple of beers while you’re at it, I told him.</p>
<p>He stopped, glared at me, then at the lieutenant.</p>
<p>Make it five, the Lt. said. Here. He held out a five dollar bill,
which meant PX beer.</p>
<p>We’d really prefer German beer, sir, Ted said.</p>
<p>I don’t care what you’d prefer, so shut up. No … talk, it’s late.</p>
<p>I better explain what Ted and I were doing in that room in the 2nd
Armored Division headquarters building at midnight being interrogated
and very willing to confess all even without torture. For me it began a
few months earlier (in the 1950s during the Korean War) when I was
transferred from the Berlin Military Intelligence Unit to a service
company for the 2<sup>nd</sup> Armored Division in Bad Kreuznach, West
Germany. Actually I was purged. There are various reasons for
purging…you could be a security risk, or a fuck up, or insubordinate. In
hindsight I must admit that I was all three – a security risk for
insisting on being John Frigero’s friend. John’s the guy who taught us
to sing the <em>Internationale</em> in basic training; he wasn’t a
communist though, just a history professor with a sense of humor. He was
purged as soon as we got to Germany when the security officer didn’t
understand his humor. He got himself transferred to the Public
Information Office..smart guy. I was labeled a fuck up when Master
Sergeant Callahan sent me to the Frankfurt airport to pick up two spies
coming from Berlin for debriefing. I went there in civvies and an
unmarked car and met the Pan American flight at 9 p.m., but they weren’t
on it, so I waited for the 10 p.m. flight and they weren’t on it either.
So I called Callahan and reported.</p>
<p>They’re already here, asshole, he said, they took a taxi. I found out
later that there are two sides to the Frankfurt airport: civilian and
U.S. military. Our spies had, naturally, arrived on the military shuttle
on the military side. But they’d never told me about that so how was I
supposed to know?</p>
<p>They sent me to Berlin to join the rest of the fuck ups. The best job
there was recruiting spies. You hung out in bars and cabarets meeting
people and recruiting the ones who were dumb enough to go to East
Germany and spy for us. Or smart enough to rip us off. The Master
Sergeant asked me if I spoke German. I said sure, but I spoke Russian
better. Actually, I only spoke the little German I had been able to pick
up in the three months I had been in Germany, but spoke fluent Russian
because I had learned it at the Army Language School in Monterey,
California.</p>
<p>Fuck, he said, another Russian. Okay, go recruit some Russians, well
knowing that there were no Russians to recruit.</p>
<p>The first and only spy I recruited was, not surprisingly, a Marlene
Dietrich look-alike I picked up in a cabaret. I won’t go into the
recruiting process here because we weren’t supposed to have personal
relationships with our spies, especially not <em>sexual</em> ones. She
went into East Germany – she said, and came back with a lot of
information, even photos. We gave our spies cigarette lighter-sized
Minox cameras, but the smart ones refused to take them to the East. What
if they were searched by the Russians? It turned out, though, that
Marlene (names have been changed to protect the guilty) had already
worked for Air Force and Naval intelligence, as well as the French and
the British, not to mention the CIA, and had been deemed not only
untrustworthy but probably a double agent. (I wouldn’t have been
surprised if most if not all our spies were double or triple.)</p>
<p>They put me in the Shit Squad where, according to Captain Olszevskii,
I should have been all along.</p>
<p>The Shit Squad analyzed Russian language documents covered in dried
shit. Russian soldiers didn’t have toilet paper, you see, so they used
any paper available, which they considered superior to the leaves they
used at home. After use they threw the paper into the trash and our
spies claimed they surreptitiously stole the trash at night. Actually,
they bought it for a few pfennnigs from the Russian soldiers, who didn’t
have money either. The spies carried back what they could in briefcases
(<em>all</em> Germans, East and West, carried briefcases, nothing
suspicious about that), where it was dumped on us for analysis. Although
occasionally military documents were included – menus, propaganda, etc –
ninety percent were personal letters from home in atrocious Russian. “My
Dear Ilyosha, How is the borsch in the Army?…keep warm…”</p>
<p>After a month of this I went to Captain Olszevskii and told him my
German was greatly improved (it was) and requested transfer back to
recruiting. He refused, saying that he didn’t need any more Mata Haris,
so I said I wasn’t going to read any more Russian shit.</p>
<p>Why Not? he demanded.</p>
<p>It’s not hygienic, I said. Besides, I’m allergic to other people’s
shit.</p>
<p>He said he was giving me Company Punishment for insubordination and
the punishment was a week confined to quarters. This was essentially
meaningless because our quarters were in civilian apartments and we came
and went as we pleased. If he really wanted to screw me, however, he
could get some fink to check on me and catch me outside quarters at
night. I doubted he’d go to that extreme, but for me it was a matter of
principle. I demanded a court-martial with a defense lawyer, judge, the
works. </p>
<p>He realized that he’d look like more of an ass than he really was if
he convened a court-martial involving classified information for such a
minor offence, so he dismissed me furiously, swearing to put my ass in a
sling somehow.</p>
<p>That’s how I was transferred out of Military Intelligence and into
the service company in the boondocks of Rheinland-Westphalen, namely Bad
Kreuznach. It was a strange company, with more officers than enlisted
men, and most of the latter sergeants. In other words, a dumping ground
for fuck ups. We were billeted in a beautiful German <em>Kaserne</em>
(barracks), two, at most four to a room, with indirect lighting and
central heat. The Company Commander was an alcoholic WWII hero with a
battlefield commission and the First Sergeant was a 20% (per month) loan
shark.</p>
<p>I arrived one fine day at the Bad Kreuznach railroad station and was
surprised to find an army car with a German driver waiting for me. I
mean corporals aren’t used to that kind of service. The driver, Karl,
saluted and asked me if I was Corporal Schmidt. Smith, I corrected him.
Ja, Ja, that’s what I said. On the way to the Kasern he told me that he
had been in the army on the Russian front and had always been a fervent
anti-Nazi. Ja, Ja, I said, I already know the story, and he laughed. I
asked him if he always picked new people up at the station. Only
officers, he said. “So you must be very important.”</p>
<p>It took a while, but I eventually realized that my importance lay in
the fact that my MOS (Military Occupational Specialty) was still
“intelligence analyst”, and they were all suspicious that I had come to
analyze <em>them</em> – not because they were intelligent, but because
they were fuck ups, loan sharks, drunks, pimps and, in a few cases,
retards. The First Sergeant even refused to lend me money at any
percentage. </p>
<p>We were bussed every morning to the outskirts where our duty lay: a
huge laundry operation for the 2<sup>nd</sup> Armored Division and a
motor pool, all manned by Polish refugees under American officers and
noncoms. The Poles were in so-called “service units” and were given blue
uniforms, free food and lodging and pocket money. Actually it was a good
idea (the only good idea I ever saw during my military experience)
because Germany was awash with Eastern European refugees before the Wall
was built and there still wasn’t enough work for them – so we put them
in quasi-military units and let them work for us.</p>
<p>Next door was the Command Post. Commanding Officer a full colonel,
then there were three Lt. Colonels, four or five captains, a warrant
officer, a bunch of sergeants and one corporal: me. Because of my MOS as
Intelligence Analyst I was assigned to Lt. Col. Moultry Hanks, S3
officer. Now, as most of you will know, S3 is Operations and S2 is
Intelligence. But 2 is close to 3, so…get it? Col. Hanks was
enthusiastic at my arrival, because it enabled him to create an S2
section with him as officer-in-charge and me as noncom-in-charge. He had
me promoted to sergeant of course, because who ever heard of a corporal
in charge of anything.</p>
<p>We even had some top secret documents and I still had my security
clearance. I’ll tell you now about those documents, but please keep it
under your hats, because I don’t know if the Freedom of Information Act
applies to them yet. They were plans for the evacuation of dependents in
case the Russkies invaded. They specified that all dependents had to
keep the gas tanks of their private cars at least half full and to have
three days of non-perishable food on hand at all times. I didn’t see how
that part could be very secret because we necessarily had to advise all
the dependents so they could comply. But the routes they were to take
through Germany and France to French ports where transport ships were
waiting 24/7 – yeah, that was Top Secret. We also had a top secret code
book which, now that he had someone who understood it, Col. Hanks used
to send practice messages to the other units in the sub-area. The Top
Secret messages, send by short wave radio, invariably read: “Testing
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 -10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1. If you left the second 10
out, the message was automatically rejected and had to be re-sent. It
was all to Col. Hanks’ credit.</p>
<p>All that stuff, including me, was locked in a Top Secret vault … no,
I won’t exaggerate; it was a room with a barred door like in a prison. I
had one key and Col. Hanks the other. I could leave whenever I wanted. I
also had a Colt 45 in case … actually I didn’t know why. Col. Hanks
appointed himself Intelligence Inspector General for the Sub-Area, which
meant he sent me monthly with my trusty Colt 45 to the only two
Sub-Sub-Areas we had – Worms (of Martin Luther fame) and Mainz, to
inspect security features. He appointed fuck up captains as S2 officers
in those stations. I appointed fuck up privates (after they had been
promoted to corporals) as S2 noncoms. We (my corporals and I) generally
spent the evenings after my inspections with Fräuleins of their
acquaintance in local <em>Gasthäuser</em>.</p>
<p>So much for background, now back to the big maneuver. The Commanding
General of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Armored Division decided to play war games
with his men. You know, divided into Red]{style=“color:red”} and
Blue]{style=“color:blue”} armies and may the best army win. Officers
took such things seriously (maybe they still do) because it looks good
in their progress reports if they commanded something in the winning
army. We fuck ups were left out…originally, until Col. Hanks had his
brainstorm. He asked me how we could contribute to the game. I am
convinced that officers hate the draft. It was a draft army then, which
meant that many enlisted men were smarter than most officers. So Col.
Hanks’ brainstorm consisted of asking me for a brainstorm. I soon came
up with an operational plan. According to the war game, a couple of
2<sup>nd</sup> Armored Division companies were to be dumped in a wooded
area in the northern sector of the Sub-Area, as though they were escaped
American prisoners of war – the Blues]{style=“color:blue”}. The rest of
the Division (Reds]{style=“color:red”}) were to hunt and capture them
before they could reach Bad Kreuznach. Those who did reach B.K. without
being captured would receive a three-day pass and honorable mention in
their records.</p>
<p>My plan was that we (me and Pfc soon to be corporal Ted Jung - yes, I
had an assistant by then, with whom I spent endless duty hours playing
chess) would play the part of the underground. We would assist the
escapees by bringing them back to B.K. in a vehicle – if they were able
to contact us. If they had to walk all the way it would take two days
and they only had k-rations and weren’t allowed to have money on
them.</p>
<p>Ted and I got a map of the area, followed the road north with a
pencil to about a quarter of the way from the escapees’ drop off point,
measured three kilometers into the woods and marked an X. We copied the
coordinates and decided it would take us about a half hour to walk to X
from the road where we would leave the van which we would get from the
motor pool. We calculated the time it would take the escapees to walk
there – a few hours, by which time we would be there waiting for
them.</p>
<p>Col. Hanks was delighted. He showed the plan to the Commanding
General who, although he may not have been delighted, decided he had
nothing to lose and approved it. We briefed the escapees the night
before their drop off, telling them if they could get to X (we gave them
the coordinates and landmarks from the map) their troubles were over. We
would transport them in comfort to freedom – army style.</p>
<p>The next morning Ted and I slept in late; we didn’t have to be at the
rendezvous (X) for a couple of hours – according to our calculations. I
dressed in my Bogart getup, fedora hat and all, and was quite pleased
with myself. Ted looked much more a German than I, but we laughed at
each other.</p>
<p>Major Bunnyson said to tell youse guys to bring the van back
dent-free, the motor pool duty sergeant told us.</p>
<p>Tell the major not to worry, I said. His rattletrap couldn’t be in
better hands. I slipped a sleeve down over my right hand. See? I got one
and Ted’s got one. Yeah, Ted added, and please tell him to kiss my ass
while you’re at it. We blew kisses and I gunned the van out onto the
road.</p>
<p>It took us two hours to reach the spot where we were to leave the
van, almost an hour more than planned. How did we know it wouldn’t go
more than 60 kms. per hour? What we plunged into was more like a jungle
than woods, overgrown with bushes and trees and hard going. We had a
compass which we hoped would lead us directly to the spot where we were
supposed to wait for the Yanks who had so cleverly escaped from the
krauts. Actually Krauts weren’t the enemy any more, but it was hard to
imagine another one in a German jungle. We were hampered by hills and
dales, rocks, shrubs and detours, but by sheer will and luck we finally
reached the meeting point (X) – although it took us three hours instead
of thirty minutes. Four guys were lounging on a slope.</p>
<p>Jeez, one said, it took you guys long enough.</p>
<p>What happened to the rest, Ted asked. Captured?</p>
<p>Nah, they got tired of waiting and went south. You guys are four
hours late.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, the krauts came to our village looking for you guys and
we had to hide in a cellar till they left, I said.</p>
<p>What krauts? I thought they were supposed to be Russkies, a runt with
ears like Dumbo said.</p>
<p>Whatever.</p>
<p>Oh, I get it. All part of the war game – right?</p>
<p>Right, Ted said. You guys gotta learn patience. We’re glad you four
got patience, so we’ll give you a special mention.</p>
<p>Fuck the mention, a wise guy said. Let’s get outa here. I’m freezing
my ass off.</p>
<p>Ted and I were drenched in sweat. Wait a couple of minutes, I said.
We have to rest.</p>
<p>How far’s the vee-hicle?</p>
<p>About two kilometers.</p>
<p>But not as the crow flies, Ted added.</p>
<p>What crow? Dumbo asked</p>
<p>We kept up the conversation a few minutes more in order to rest, but
finally had to get started, and not only because our escapees were
anxious to move. We had no idea how long it would take us to get back to
the road and our van, and the day was waning.</p>
<p>Hey, something’s wrong with the compass, Ted said after we’d only
gone a few steps.</p>
<p>What now? I groaned.</p>
<p>The needle doesn’t move.</p>
<p>Lemme see that, Dumbo said. He flicked it hard with his thumb as
though he were playing marbles. He shook it a bit and said, It was
stuck, that’s all. Which way we goin’?</p>
<p>West-north-west, Ted told him.</p>
<p>That’s all? Nothin’ more exact than that?</p>
<p>Well no, we came east-south-east, so we gotta go back the
opposite.</p>
<p>Yeah, you could find Paris that way. What are we lookin’ for?</p>
<p>Never mind, I interrupted, let’s just go or we won’t get
<em>any</em>where. I figured we’d have to at least hit the road – even
if not exactly where the van was – which was better than the jungle.</p>
<p>It got dark much quicker than we expected and our situation looked
dark as well. The escapees were equipped to spend the night outdoors,
but Ted and I definitely weren’t.</p>
<p>It was almost pitch black, no moon, when we spotted a light ahead.
The others stopped complaining and one of them said, “Are we there?”</p>
<p>We didn’t answer him, just stumbled towards the light.</p>
<p>It turned out to be a Gasthaus on the other side of a road. As we
crossed it Ted said, Hey Frank, this is a pretty skimpy road. The one we
parked the van on was much wider.</p>
<p>I had noticed that, but didn’t want to think about it. Maybe it
narrows down farther up north than we got, I said – and hoped.</p>
<p>Inside the Gasthaus it was warm and gemütlich. Five or six German men
were seated around a <em>Stammtisch</em> drinking beer and playing
cards. They were laughing and smoking and joking around, obviously not
paying much attention to the game. We must have looked like men from
Mars to them. They shut up and stared at us open-mouthed. A young
beauteous Fräulein was behind the bar leaning over with her chin on her
hand. She wore a dirndl cut low pushing up her breasts. Ted and I
approached her.</p>
<p>Is this the road to Bad Kreuznach?</p>
<p>She smiled. No, it’s the road to the road to Bad Kreuznach.</p>
<p>Oh, I said, puzzled. And how far is it from the road to the road to
Bad Kreuznach to the road to Bad Kreuznach?</p>
<p>The Germans were all listening of course, and they burst out
laughing.</p>
<p><em>Bier für die Amis</em>! One of them shouted. Both Ted and I had
accents and our charges were in uniform, so we were obviously Amis. The
girl moved to the middle of the bar and began pouring steins of tap
beer. The grunts didn’t speak German, but they understood Bier and Amis,
so they rushed to the bar. We were all thirsty. We turned to our
benefactors, raised our glasses and said, <em>Prost</em>! They returned
the toast with deafening shouts.</p>
<p>It’s about ten kilometers to that main road, the barmaid said.</p>
<p>Ten kilometers!</p>
<p>Yes, it’s only about two through the woods, but no one would go
through the woods at night.</p>
<p>We downed our beer and I said to Ted, We should buy them one back. I
have ten marks, how about you? Ted was a thrifty person, I knew, and
foreseeing. In other words, he always had money on him.</p>
<p>No problem, he said.</p>
<p>Beer for our friends, I told the girl, who looked familiar. What’s
your name?</p>
<p>Heidi.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Yes, it’s a ridiculous name. I’m going to change it as soon as I get
out of here. I’m going to the university soon.</p>
<p>A rose by any other name would smell as sweet, I tried to say in
German, hoping that it didn’t get skewed. I guess it didn’t for she
smiled as sweetly as a rose.</p>
<p>Which university is that?</p>
<p>Mainz, she replied.</p>
<p>That’s not so far.</p>
<p>Not far enough, she said.</p>
<p>Then it hit me. Do you know who you look like?</p>
<p>Who?</p>
<p>Ingrid Bergman.</p>
<p>Oh? Who’s that?</p>
<p>I’m starving, one of the grunts said.</p>
<p>He had his knapsack full of k-rations and he was starving? No … but I
was.</p>
<p>What do you say we get something to eat, I asked Ted. I’ll pay you
back my half on payday. These guys don’t have any money.</p>
<p>Well, Ted said, we’re the underground so I guess we can do whatever
we want.</p>
<p>Damn right. Heidi, do you have anything to eat?</p>
<p>We only have <em>Wiener Schnitzel</em> <em>mit</em>
<em>Kartoffelsalat</em>, she said. It’s very good.</p>
<p>My mouth watered. Great. <em>Sechs Schnitzels mit
Kartoffelsalat</em>.</p>
<p>Papa, she cried into the kitchen, and repeated the order.</p>
<p>One thing led to another and we were soon fraternizing with our new
friends, our bellies full and half drunk on real German beer, which is
not the piss you get in the States with German labels.</p>
<p>When Ted asked the Germans if they wanted to join the underground I
knew it was time to go. I had spent much of the time at the bar shooting
the breeze with Heidi – falling in love in fact. I got her phone number
and directions to the Gasthaus. She was eighteen, but what the hell, I
was only twenty. I invited her to see a great movie with the beautiful
actress whom she resembled. She wanted to know when and where.</p>
<p>I’ll find out, I promised. Maybe in Mainz.</p>
<p>She called a taxi for us, we drove the roundabout ten kilometers to
the main road and eventually found the van. We loaded our drunken living
cargo into it and somehow made it back to the Kaserne without
incident.</p>
<p>As we drove to the second rendezvous (X2) the next day Ted said, What
if the Reds]{style=“color:red”} captured some of those
Blue]{style=“color:blue”} guys yesterday and they squealed under
interrogation?</p>
<p>Squealed what?</p>
<p>Where the second day meeting point is.</p>
<p>Nah, they only have to give their names, rank and serial numbers.
Geneva Convention.</p>
<p>I guess you’re right, Ted said, but he didn’t sound convinced.</p>
<p>I wasn’t right.</p>
<p>The meeting point was the square of a village not very far from
Kreuznach. We had never been there and weren’t even sure it had a
square. But with a name like Waldorf we figured there was no reason for
it to be an exception. All German villages have a central square with a
statue of Goethe or Schiller – or if it had had Adolf, an empty
pedestal. We parked the van on the side of the road in front of a curve
in order to walk the rest of the way into town like two casual German
citizens.</p>
<p>You don’t look very German in that getup, Frank, Ted remarked as we
strolled towards the curve.</p>
<p>Play it again, Sam, I rejoined and whistled <em>As Time Goes By</em>.
It was a beautiful sunny spring day and I was feeling good for the first
time since being transferred to Bad Kreuznach. You should understand
that compared to Berlin Bad Kreuznach is <em>God’s Little Acre</em>. It
had only one mechanical traffic light that was wound up like a clock.
Although Americans were still gladly tolerated (there were more
2<sup>nd</sup> Armored Division troops than German inhabitants), we
weren’t <em>loved</em> like in Berlin, surrounded as it was by the
Soviet army. And for a girl to be seen going out in Bad Kreuznach with
an American soldier was not good for her reputation. They figured we had
only on thing on our minds...and they were right. Now, however, I was
quasi-in-love with a lovely German version of Ingrid Bergman who would
soon be living in the city of Mainz, where no one would care who she was
going with.</p>
<p>We strolled into the sharp curve and found ourselves being stared at
by a squad of Red]{style=“color:red”} soldiers lounging around the
Schiller statue. We froze. Then - keep walking, I said, act natural.
They waited until we tried to casually pass them by, then the sergeant
stood up and rudely said, Where do you guys think you’re going?</p>
<p>Nix sprechen der English, Ted said, and the whole squad roared with
laughter; one even fell down and rolled from side to side holding his
belly.</p>
<p>They made us get into the back of a truck and we all proceeded back
to headquarters, and that brings us up to date being interrogated by the
lieutenant with PX beer.</p>
<p>Besides, Lt., I said, we gotta pick up the van.</p>
<p>What van?</p>
<p>The van we got from the motor pool, government property. It’s still
parked outside Waldorf.</p>
<p>Why didn’t you bring it back when you were there?</p>
<p>We tried to tell that asshole sergeant but he was laughing so hard
he…</p>
<p>The Lt. was shaking his head. Okay, get the fuck outa here.</p>
<p>We didn’t go back to Waldorf that night, of course. The PX beer had
only made us thirsty for real German beer, so we went to the only bar in
town to relax after a successful mission during which not a shot was
fired. We returned to Waldorf the next morning in my VW and Ted drove
the van back to Kreuznach. I went on to Heidi’s Gasthouse for a lunch of
