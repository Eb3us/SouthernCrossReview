### Lesson Four

Translated from the German by Frank Thomas Smith
Dornach, March 7, 1924

My dear friends,

In the previous lessons we were concerned with meeting the
Guardian of the Threshold. And we must understand this meeting
well, to the extent that its earnestness can really occupy our
minds. For here we enter an area which is essentially different
from other areas of spiritual life, what is *called* spiritual
life by today's civilization, that is. The encounter with the
Guardian of the Threshold is the first thing one experiences when
a relationship with the spiritual world truly and earnestly takes
place. A relationship with the spiritual world cannot take place
without this understanding of the meeting with the Guardian of the
Threshold, because the spiritual world is on the other side of
this threshold. So when communications are received from the
spiritual world, they should be understood as merely in
preparation for a relationship with the spiritual world.

As an example of what we will receive today, my dear friends, I
would like to tell you a story taken from ancient esoteric
tradition.

Once upon a time a student was accepted into the mysteries. He
completed the preliminary stages. And when he had achieved a
certain stage of maturity – not that he became what most people
nowadays consider clairvoyant, but he entered into a relationship
with the spiritual world, the relationship where, as far as
feeling is concerned, one correctly receives communications from
the spiritual world – the teacher said to him:  

Behold, when I talk to you the words I speak are not human words;
what I have to say is merely clothed in human words. What I have
to say to you are the gods' thoughts, and these gods' thoughts are
imparted to you by human words. But it must be clear to you that I
am thus appealing to everything in your soul. You must meet the
words which I direct to you on behalf of the gods with all your
thinking, all your feeling, all your willing. You must receive
these words with all your soul's enthusiasm, all its inner warmth,
all its inner fire. You must receive them with total alertness, to
the limit of your mind's capacity.

But there is one soul-force in you to which I am not appealing.
Your memory. And I will be satisfied if you do not hold in your
memory what I am now saying to you. I will be satisfied if
tomorrow you forget what I have said today. Because what you
usually call your memory, and what others call your memory, is
only meant for earthly things, and not for godly things. So when
you appear before me again tomorrow, and when I again speak to
you, appealing to your thinking, feeling, willing, and to all your
enthusiasm, all your warmth, all your inner fire, to your mind's
alertness, then these soul forces will be renewed for what is to
be received. Everything should be new and freshly vital the next
day, and the day after, and every day.

I said that I do not appeal to your memory, to your capacity for
remembering. That does not mean that tomorrow you should remember
nothing of what is said to you today. But you should not preserve
it in your memory alone. You should wait an see what your memory
makes of it. What should lead you to me tomorrow in a new
attitude, however, should be your feelings, the innermost feelings
of your soul; they should preserve what is said to you today. For
you see, memory, that capacity for remembrance, is for learning.
What the esoteric has to say, however, is not merely for learning,
but for life, and every time it approaches you it should be
relived without the help of memory's concepts. \[Although there is
no indication in the original, this appears to be the end of the
story. Trans.\]

It is in fact true that whenever we are dealing with esoteric
truths we should not think: Oh, I know that already. For the
essence of the esoteric does not lie in knowledge, but in direct
experience. And inwardly, in deeper levels of our souls than where
memory has its roots, is where we should grasp and retain the
esoteric.

If you reflect on this, my dear friends, it will be of great help
in understanding true esoteric life as we continue. For what must
be taken seriously is that in the moment that we accept the
esoteric, our very understanding of it brings about a different
relationship of thinking, feeling and willing in us than our
everyday consciousness is accustomed to.

For everyday consciousness, thinking, feeling and willing are
bound together. A trivial example may be used to demonstrate how
closely bound together thinking, feeling and willing are in normal
consciousness. Let's say you know someone, anyone, with whom you
had an intimate or a more distant relationship. The things you
experienced with him or her have been retained in your memory and
permeate your feelings. When you are together with her these
things lead you to certain actions in your behavior towards her.
You go on in life with such thoughts and feelings. One day someone
reminds you of this person, says something about her and your
memory is stimulated. If you had loved her, your love is recalled;
if you hated her, your hate is recalled. If you had wanted to
undertake something together with her, this is also recalled. You
cannot separate what you feel and will towards this person with
what you think about her. \[In German, the gender of this person
is not specified; it is immaterial. Trans.\]

With this kind of attitude it is not possible to understand
esoteric truths correctly. Such truths can only be understood
correctly when, for example, the following happens. You know
someone with whom you have a certain relationship. Certain aspects
of this person are most antipathetic to you. When you are reminded
of this person, you can think of her without the antipathy
arising. You can simply think about her.

It is quite difficult, my dear friends, to just think about your
enemy without letting the animosity towards him arise. One can
practice this with a correct grasp of art. You could ask yourself:
Am I able to exclusively *think* about certain despicable
characters in Shakespeare's works? If I were to meet such
characters in real life, I would feel great antipathy towards
them. When artistically presented, however, I can regard them
objectively, perhaps just *because* they are such excellent
villains. This is possible in the artistic area, for people do not
always feel the urge to jump across the footlights and throttle
these Shakespearean villains. It is possible to separate thinking
from feeling in the artistic area.

But in order to be a true esotericist one must also be able to do
so in real life. At the moment when something derived from the
esoteric is said, it must be possible to separate thinking from
feeling in this way in order for it to be absorbed by the soul.
For they do not separate on their own. At first when we think
esoteric things, they are so strongly present within the thoughts,
and they are so distant from personal feelings, that we do not
understand them if we do not use pure thinking to do so. So if we
do not wish to listen to the esoteric like couch potatoes and let
everything pass over us with indifference, we must develop
feelings and will-impulses apart from those engendered through
thinking. Such feelings should be developed in order that the
esoteric not remain a cold, icy field, which merely pours through
our understanding, when it should immerse us in the brightest
enthusiasm. But this enthusiasm, this world of feeling, must come
from somewhere else if it does not come from thinking.

For you see, if we want to make our feelings warm in the right
way, we must be clear about the fact that when one speaks
correctly from out of the esoteric, he is speaking from the godly
sphere and therefore our feelings do not encounter thoughts, but
realities.

That is why when I gave the first lesson I said that it is the
School that speaks here, that is, the true spirit which goes
through the School, and that it is necessary to realize that the
School has not been born of some personal intention, but that it
has been willed and instated by the spiritual world. If we see it
in this way, the School's existence will give us the enthusiasm we
need.

And then we will understand something else. Yes, my dear friends,
in ordinary life and in ordinary science, we are spoken to in
words. And when we understand the words, the thoughts they are
meant to express come to us because they are contained in the
words. The esotericist must also use words, for he must speak. But
he uses words only as a means to show how the spirit flows toward
us in streams and seeks to pour itself into human hearts.

Therefore it is necessary that in an Esoteric School a sense is
gradually developed to hear beyond the words. And when this sense
has been developed it will be possible to acquire – in respect to
the esoteric – what has been called in esoteric streams of all
times with an attitude of holiness: *silence –* the silence which
preserves holiness*.* And this holiness-preserving silence is
connected with something else, without which the esoteric can not
further humanity. It is connected with innermost humility. And
without this innermost humility it is not possible to approach the
esoteric. Why? Well, when we are exhorted to hear beyond the
words, it is an appeal to the innermost essence of our souls, not
to our memory. Then our capacity comes into play, to what extent
we are capable of hearing beyond the words. And it is good for our
souls to hear much. But we should not jump to the conclusion that
what dawns in our souls as a result is necessarily valid and
should be relayed to the world. We will need much time, even when
we hear beyond the words, before we come to terms with ourselves.
We should develop the idea that the esoteric must first live and
weave wordlessly in the soul before it can be considered to be
mature enough.

Therefore in the esoteric we must go back from what words mean in
ordinary life to the deeper understanding in the soul. And that is
what I did in the last lesson, my dear friends, when I provided
mantric verses for you, in which scanning is used. The first verse
had a trochaic rhythm, the second an iambic rhythm and the third a
spondaic rhythm. We should feel as though we were descending from
the mountain into the valley with the trochaic rhythm, and we
should understand how this rhythm, which pertains to thinking, can
by grasped only when we feel this descent within the soul. That is
why this verse is trochaic, beginning with a stressed syllable and
descending to an unstressed one. It was meant to instill in us a
kind of psychic blood circulation in spiritual space. We don't
just stand still when such mantras penetrate our souls, or voice
certain thoughts, but we move together with the spiritual movement
of the cosmos, in that human thoughts weave into human souls. So
we learned the first verse, which is related to thinking:

> > See in yourself the weaving thoughts:\
> > Cosmic semblances confront you,\
> > Selfhood as such hides from you;\
> > Plunge beneath the semblances:\
> > Etheric essence flows in you;\
> > Selfhood as such should revere\
> > Guiding beings of your spirit.

Yes, the gods have raised us to themselves by giving us thoughts.
And we descend from the peaks upon which the gods have placed us
down into the valleys, where we encompass and grasp earthly things
with these thoughts.

It is different with feeling. We act correctly if, standing below
in the valley, we wish to ascend with our feelings on a spiritual
ladder to the gods. Feeling puts us in the opposite wave movement:
from below to above. Therefore the mantric verse has an iambic
rhythm. It begins with an unstressed syllable and rises to a
stressed one. We should feel it:

> > Do hear within the flow of feeling:\
> > When semblance and being within you blend,\
> > Your selfhood tends towards the semblance;\
> > So plunge into what's seemingly being:\
> > In you the cosmic-psychic forces live;\
> > Your selfhood then should well consider\
> > Your soul's own vital powers.

And it's again different when we come to the will. To do so, we
must be aware that our humanity is split within us. Then we must
move close to the gods in feeling and, halfway there, through
feeling's strength give birth to the will-impulse. That is only
possible if we meditate in the spondaic, beginning with two
stressed syllables:

> > Let strive in you with thrust of will:\
> > What rises out of semblance-being\
> > With creative self it rises up;\
> > Turn life in full to this\
> > Filled with cosmic-spirit-force;\
> > Your inner self should truly grasp\
> > Creative cosmic power in the spirit-I.

As I said last time, it is not a question of understanding the
meaning of words, but that we also grasp what lies in the words'
movements and that our souls enter into that movement. In that way
we no longer depend only on ourselves, but we grow into the
universe.

Words whose meanings alone are grasped leave us unto ourselves.
When the esoteric is concerned, however, it is a matter of growing
together with the world, that we more and more come out of
ourselves. For only so, by coming out of ourselves, are we able to
withstand the separation of thinking, feeling and willing. Within
ourselves, our corporeal “I” holds thinking, feeling and willing
together for everyday consciousness. Outside, they must be held
together by the gods. For this, however, we must enter the divine
being. And we must grow together with the world. We must learn to
develop a sense through which we can say to ourselves in all
honesty and earnestness: Here I have my hand; I contemplate it.
Over there stands a tree; I contemplate it. I contemplate my hand:
it is I. I contemplate the tree: it is I. I contemplate the cloud:
it is I. I contemplate the rainbow: it is I. I contemplate the
thunder: it is I. I contemplate the lightning: it is I. I feel
myself one with the world.

Abstractly, meaning dishonestly, this is easy to achieve.
Concretely, meaning honestly, one must overcome many inner
aspects. If, however, one does not shy away from overcoming these
things, the desired goal will be achieved. For the question the
esotericist must ask himself is: I contemplate my hand; it belongs
to me. What would my life – which began a few decades ago – have
become if I didn't have the hand? It is necessary for all I have
become. But the tree: it is as it stands before us today – its
conception originally from the Ancient Moon – grown out of the
whole earth organism. What was present in the Ancient Moon
organism could not have existed had the conception of the tree not
been developed. But at that time the conception of my thinking
also arose. If the tree didn't exist, I would not be thinking
today. My hand is only necessary for my present earthly existence.
The tree is necessary in order that I can be a thinking being. Why
should the hand be worth more to me than the tree? Why should I
reckon the hand more to my physicality than the tree? Little by
little I am able to realize that what I call the outer world is
much more my inner world than what I considered to be the interior
of my physicality in this incarnation. To feel this deeply and
sincerely must be learned.

So today we will consider three verses, mantric verses, through
which this *feeling-one* with the whole so-called “outer being”
can gradually penetrate deeply into the soul.

What is our attitude initially towards outer being? We look down
at the earth. We feel dependent on this earth; it gives us what we
need to live. We look into space. The sun rises in the morning; it
goes down in the evening; its light streams across the earth; it
comes from afar, it goes afar. We look up at night: the heavenly
sky speaks mysteriously to us. In this threefold gaze our
relationship to the world is determined. I look downward, I look
out afar, I look upward. But let us do this with intensive
consciousness, let us do it as indicated in the following mantric
verses:

> > Feel how the earth's depths\
> > Press its forces in your being,\
> > In the members of your body.\
> > You lose yourself in them,\
> > If you entrust powerless\
> > Your will to their striving.\
> > Darkly eclipsed will be your I.

\[These lines are written on the blackboard.\]

> > *Feel how the earth's depths*\
> > *Press its forces in your being,*\
> > *In the members of your body.*\
> > *You lose yourself in them,*

> - in the forces - 

> > *If you entrust powerless*\
> > *Your will to their striving.*\
> > *Darkly eclipsed will be your I.*

You see, my dear friends, we do not consciously relate what binds
us to the earth with our own humanity. We look down at the earth,
knowing that crystals are formed in it, knowing that it moves
through space, that it exerts a force of gravity, that it attracts
the stone that falls to earth, knowing that it attracts even us.
We think about all this. What we don't think about are the urges,
instincts, cravings and passions that live in us, what we ascribe
to lower human nature, and which also belong to the earth. When we
look down and ask what the earth causes in us, we should remember:
something exists in us, created by the earth, which would drag us
down below the human level, which would darken our I, which would
push us into the subhuman region. We must be aware that we are so
bound to the earth that, despite all its beauty and majesty that
spreads over its surface, for us humans the downward force is at
the same time a sub-humanizing force. By honestly recognizing this
we develop into true human beings.

Then we will be able to not only look downward in our development,
but also to look afar in the distance at our own height and to see
what surrounds the earth on all sides and describes our humanity
within a circle. Thus something begins physically, which to a
certain extent lifts us above the downward pulling earthly forces.
Through the downward pulling earthly forces man can become evil;
but not so easily through the breath, which also belongs to what
encircles the earth. And even less through the light which the sun
lets encircle the earth. We consider breath and light as things
that have no spiritual importance. But gods live in breath and
light. And we must be aware that godly forces are especially
active in light and, because they pass through us humans, act
differently than the deep earthly forces.

This brings the second mantric verse to our consciousness:

> > *Feel how from cosmic distance*\
> > *Godly forces let their spirit-light*\
> > *Shine into your psychic being.*\
> > *Find yourself in them loving,*\
> > *And they creating, wisdom weaving*\
> > *You as self in their circles*\
> > *Strong for spiritual works of good.*

We are not always aware that we can love what flows over our earth
as light, be it sunlight or starlight. But we are aware that we
can love the sunlight, love it as warmly as a friend, then we also
learn how gods in garments of light circle round the earth. Then
the opinion that sunlight is merely what illuminates the earth
changes for good; sunlight becomes the garment of the gods. And
the gods wander over the earth in shining garments. And what we
experience from the light becomes wisdom. The gods bring their
wisdom to our hearts, into our souls. And now, because of this
differentiation in feelings, we have ascended higher.

First we developed the appropriate feelings in respect to the deep
earthly forces. We sensed correctly the part of our humanity that
belongs to the deep earthly forces. Then we raised ourselves to
that higher part of our humanity which belongs to the godly beings
in shining garments moving over the earth, who do not wish to
leave man in the earthly sphere but, even while he is walks on the
earth, raise him to their spheres, so that when he passes through
the gates of death, he can continue to walk in them. For the gods
do not want to leave us alone on earth, but want to bring us into
their spheres. They want to make us into beings who live among
them. The deep earth forces want to separate us from the godly
forces.

Therefore, a previous mantra communicated to you:

> > The first beast's bony spirit:\
> > The will's evil creative power,\
> > Which would estrange your own body\
> > From the soul's inherent strength\
> > And devote it to the counter-forces,\
> > Which would steal in future time\
> > Cosmic being from the gods.

We must, however, also feel this when we are in the world and feel
ourselves to be one with the world.

But we have not yet reached our full humanity in consciousness if
we cannot look upward. We must gaze into the depths, we must gaze
into the distance, we must gaze into the heights. From everyday
consciousness which mixes the depth, the distant and the height,
we must differentiate depth-consciousness, distant-consciousness,
height-consciousness.

\[The third verse is written on the blackboard.\]

> > *Feel how in heaven's heights*\
> > *Selfhood can selflessly exist*

We can feel that we are gazing up into the heights with full
consciousness. Think, my dear friends, about standing outside in a
field looking up at a star-bedecked sky. It becomes clearer when
we have the opportunity to choose; it can also happen in daylight,
but it is clearer at night. We feel at one with the world; we
feel: that is you. But the point on earth we stand on, which we
consider to be so important that it only encompasses our
individual self, dissolves when we gaze up into space. It expands
to the hemisphere. If we do this in the right way, then narrow
selfhood ends and becomes selfless, for it is infinitely expanded
in the heights of space:

> > Feel how in heaven's heights\
> > Selfhood can selflessly exist,

\[writing continues.\]

> > *If spirit-filled force of thought*\
> > *Follows striving in the heights*

Who really feels how the gods in shining garments move around the
earth with the steaming sunlight and with every breath breathes in
and breathes out of the human soul, and who gazes skywards feeling
selfless in his selfhood, is soon able to also develop the
distance of space within. The following lines are pertinent:

> > Feel how in heaven's heights\
> > Selfhood can selflessly exist,\
> > If spirit-filled force of thought\
> > Follows striving in the heights

\[writing continues.\]

> > *And with courage hears the words*\
> > *Gracefully intoning from above*\
> > *Into man's genuine being.*

The heights are speaking. And just as we can grow in love together
with the gods who move around the earth in shining garments, we
can also grow together with the words resounding from the heights,
if we develop the capacity to strive together with the forces of
thinking in the heavenly heights.

But, my dear friends, you will only be able to correctly achieve
these inner feelings, which convert your consciousness to a depth,
spatial and heights-consciousness, if you make the corresponding
verses \[about the third, second and first beasts\] so deep and
visible for your souls as contrasted with these verses \[the three
verses on the blackboard\].

You come before the Guardian of the Threshold. Living
thought-images about it should be active in your minds. The
Guardian of the Threshold shows you the third beast of which we
spoke in the previous lesson. What this beast characterizes
resounds within you:

> > The third beast's glassy eye,\
> > Is the evil counterpart\
> > Of thinking, that denies itself\
> > In you and chooses death,\
> > Forsaking the spirit-force\
> > which before it's earthly life\
> > Lived its life in fields of spirit.

It is what draws us downward. We escape from it by saying with
inner courage:

> > Feel how the earth's depths\
> > Press its forces in your being,\
> > In the members of your body.\
> > You lose yourself in them,\
> > If you entrust powerless\
> > Your will to their striving.\
> > Darkly eclipsed will be your I.

At first glance there seems to be little difference between
looking at the beast and what liberates you from it. Both mantras
sound similar in that they both characterize the drawing under,
except that one specifically describes the beast, while the other
indicates watchfulness.

But let us go on to the second beast and take what rescues us from
it; place both mantric verses alongside each other: the mood is
completely different. In one the gruesome description of the
second beast, in the other an appeal to the gods who approach us
in shining garments. And we hear these two mantric verses
alongside each other, how different their styles are:

> > The second beast's mocking countenance\
> > Is the evil counter-force of feeling,\
> > Which hollows out its own soul\
> > And creates an empty life\
> > Instead of fullness of spirit\
> > With light from the force of the sun\
> > Before your earthly existence.  
> > 
> > Feel how from cosmic distance\
> > Godly forces let their spirit-lig\ht
> > Shine into your psychic being.\
> > Find yourself in them loving,\
> > And they creating, wisdom weaving\
> > You as self within their circles\
> > Strong for spiritual works of good.

Because we begin by describing the third beast, we must place
ourselves, as in this mantric verse \[Feel how the earth's
depths...\], next to the third beast. At first we can not free
ourselves, we are only prompted to be aware of where the beast
wants to lead us. When we turn to the second beast, and the
helping mantric verse \[Feel how from cosmic distance...\], the
verse is already able to lead us far away from the beast whose
ghastliness is characterized by its mocking face.

And when we approach the first beast, which wants to hinder us
from hallowing our humanity by gazing up to the heavenly heights,
and how we can escape in our innermost being from this beast, if
we turn to the mantric verse which leads us upwards to the
heavenly heights:

> > The first beast's bony spirit:\
> > The will's evil creative power,\
> > Which would estrange your own body\
> > From the soul's inherent strength\
> > And devote it to the counter-forces,\
> > Which would steal in future time\
> > Cosmic being from the gods.

And yet: As though we wished to burn up all that this verse says
and lift ourselves up in flame, the other verse exists – comforter
and grace-giving as opposed to what the first beast is, by means
of our own courageous soul-force:

> > Feel how in heaven's heights\
> > Selfhood can selflessly exist,\
> > If spirit-filled force of thought\
> > Follows striving in the heights\
> > And with courage hears the words\
> > Gracefully intoning from above\
> > Into man's genuine being.

You see, the last time we saw that we practice an inner rhythm
when we integrate our own being into the shining light-being of
the world, so today we must recognize how the esoteric things
which we are learning have an inner connection, so that we must
always go back to the previous elements – not only in respect to
the meaning of the words, which remain earthly, but to the inner
disposition. And this disposition, this mood, comes both from the
whole and from the details.

Take for example the first verse: “Feel how the earth's depths”.
Here we are directed to the earth's depths. And the other verse
directs us to “ The third beast's glassy eye”. They belong
together.

In the second verse “Feel how from cosmic distance”: We feel how
the gods approach in shining garments. Here we are raised up – if
we can really feel it – and away from what mocks the divine in the
world. “The second beast's mocking countenance” is truly wiped
away by radiant sunshine, if we wish to grasp “radiant sunshine”
spiritually.

And the third verse, which begins: “The first beast's bony spirit”
ossifies us. We become warm if we are freed from the ossification
by gazing at the heavenly heights. So we can also say:

When you see the third beast's glassy eye, stand firm and feel
what the earth's depths want from you.

When you see the second beast's mocking face, lovingly receive the
sunlight.

When you feel ossified by the first beast's bony spirit, warm
yourself as a human being by raising your heart warmly to heaven's
heights.

Thus we shall gradually feel our way into spiritual life, and this
spiritual life will grow ever more closely related to our soul.

\*

My dear friends, it is necessary to add something, because the
School must be taken seriously, and what I said that Wednesday
about its conditions must be taken seriously. So I have been
obliged to withdraw the membership card from a person who, by
neglecting to do what is necessary on duty here, could have caused
a great misfortune. I mention this here because I wish to show
that the intentions indicated during the Christmas Meeting must be
taken seriously. And I request that in the future this should not
be understood as a mere manner of speaking, if the fact that this
Esoteric School is desired in all earnestness by the spiritual
world is deemed valid, and in the moment when someone does not
want to be a representative of the anthroposophical movement in
the right way, the School must reserve the right to withdraw his
membership card. I wish to indicate in all earnestness that the
membership card had to be withdrawn from a person – at least for a
period of time, until that person shows by his attitude that the
opposite is the case. We will grow into the School in the right
way if we reject all the flippant views about the anthroposophical
movement which have brought so much mischief into the movement. We
must grow into the esoteric in full earnestness. And I must say
here again that what was meant in the Christmas Meeting has not
been understood by everyone. But the School's leadership will be
alert and will take the School seriously. Let us bear this in mind
as part of today's lesson.
