# Reincarnation Blues -- Canto V

## by Frank Thomas Smith

Look at it, if you will, this way:\
If you\'re here now and likely alive,\
Where were you before today?\
Before, that is, you dropped or dived

Into this wild and woolly world?\
Not a cut-rate clue have you\
Unless you think you once uncurled\
And mewing in Mama\'s uterus grew.

Well, that\'s true, but it is not all.\
You dew-dropped in like a lonesome lover\
From that place you\'re gonna recall\
Once your earthly life is over.

If you don\'t believe me, wait and see.\
no one has ever arrived from nowhere,\
Not even The Champ, Mohamed Ali.\
The trick now is to find that somewhere.

Stop looking at me with panting wonder\
As if I knew who He might be:\
The One who\'ll call with tone of thunder\
To searchers yearning to be free.

You\'ll have to wait for future Cantos,\
hopefully in number seven,\
Including pathos as well as bathos,\
If by then you\'re not in heaven.
