RE: [A Girl I knew](https://southerncrossreview.org/145/salinger-girl-i-knew.html) by J.D. Salinger

Hi Frank,

This is a gem of a short story. You can see that Salinger's art was in
already in high form prior to *Catcher. * It reminds me of James Joyce's
"The Dead." I have attached the pdf for you (I think the copyright has
expired), if you don't already have it. What I am most surprised at
is that Good Housekeeping would allow some profanity into their pages in
1948. Thank you for publishing this piece. 

Best regards,

Edward Tazer Meyers

Buenos días,

Hermoso escrito que me trae recuerdos de mis lecturas juveniles de Ana
Frank, se respira el mismo tierno aroma dentro de un inmenso drama,
quizas por eso.

Saludos,

I loved this beautiful poem! So poignant and a wonderful reminder of
what nature can be for us.

I have read and reread this beautiful poem by Becky Hemsley and am moved
every time I read it.  I think of the women I love, who so easily fit
this story, one part of which, somewhere, there\'s a woman will
identify. Maybe not all but certainly some.  Times are changing, 
women\'s role is no longer assessed by the old rules of how we are
supposed to be,  but inside,  too many of us still feel we were born to
fix life for the world! Love this poem, is there a published book I can
share? Thank you.
