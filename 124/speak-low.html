		<p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.3em">S</span>peak low, when you speak, love.<br>
		Our summer day<br>
		Withers away<br>
		Too soon, too soon.<br>
		Speak low. When you speak, love.<br>
		Our moment is swift<br>
		Like ships adrift,<br>
		We're swept apart, too soon.<br>
		Speak low, darling, speak low.<br>
		Love is a spark<br>
		Lost in the dark,<br>
		Too soon, too soon.<br>
		I feel wherever I go<br>
		That tomorrow is near,<br>
		Tomorrow is here,<br>
		And always too soon.<br>
		Time is so old<br>
		And love so brief,<br>
		Love is pure gold<br>
		And time a thief,<br>
		We're late, darling, we're late,<br>
		The curtain descends<br>
		Everything ends,<br>
		Too soon, too soon.<br>
		I wait, darling, I w<br>ait.<br>
		Will you speak low to me,<br>
		Speak love to me,<br>
		And soon?<br>

		<p><a href=”https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Weill”>Kurt Weill</a> (March 2, 1900 – April 3, 1950) was a German Jewish composer, active from the 1920s in his native country, and in his later years in the United States. He was a leading composer for the stage who was best known for his fruitful collaborations with Bertolt Brecht. With Brecht, he developed productions such as his best-known work The Threepenny Opera, which included the ballad "Mack the Knife". Weill held the ideal of writing music that served a socially useful purpose.[He also wrote several works for the concert hall. He became a United States citizen on August 27, 1943.</p>
		<p><a href=”https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogden_Nash”> Ogden Nash</a> (August 19, 1902 – May 19, 1971) was an American poet well known for his light verse, of which he wrote over 500 pieces. With his unconventional rhyming schemes, he was declared the country's best-known producer of humorous poetry.</p>

		<p><a href=”https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Vaughan”> Sarah Vaughan</a> (March 27, 1924 - April 3, 1990),  possessor of one of the most wondrous voices of the 20th century, Sarah Vaughan ranked with Ella Fitzgerald and Billie Holiday in the very top echelon of female jazz singers. She often gave the impression that with her wide range, perfectly controlled vibrato, and wide expressive abilities, she could do anything she wanted with her voice. Her legacy as a performer and a recording artist will be very difficult to match in the future.</p>
