<div class="poem">
		<p>Pretty women wonder</p>
		<p>Where my secret lies.</p>
		<p>I'm not cute or built</p>
		<p>To suit a fashion model's size</p>
		<p>But when I start to tell them,</p>
		<p>They think I'm telling lies.</p>
		<p>I say,</p>
		<p>It's in the reach of my arms,</p>
		<p>The span of my hips,</p>
		<p>The stride of my step,</p>
		<p>The curl of my lips.</p>
		<p>I'm a woman</p>
		<p>Phenomenally.</p>
		<p>Phenomenal woman,</p>
		<p>That's me.</p>
<br>
		<p>I walk into a room</p>
		<p>Just as cool as you please,</p>
		<p>And to a man,</p>
		<p>The fellows stand or</p>
		<p>Fall down on their knees.</p>
		<p>Then they swarm around me,</p>
		<p>A hive of honey bees.</p>
		<p>I say,</p>
		<p>It's the fire in my eyes,</p>
		<p>And the flash of my teeth,</p>
		<p>The swing in my waist,</p>
		<p>And the joy in my feet.</p>
		<p>I'm a woman</p>
		<p>Phenomenally.</p>
		<p>Phenomenal woman,</p>
		<p>That's me.</p>
<br>
		<p>Men themselves have wondered</p>
		<p>What they see in me.</p>
		<p>They try so much</p>
		<p>But they can't touch</p>
		<p>My inner mystery.</p>
		<p>When I try to show them</p>
		<p>They say they still can't see.</p>
		<p>I say,</p>
		<p>It's in the arch of my back,</p>
		<p>The sun of my smile,</p>
		<p>The ride of my breasts,</p>
		<p>The grace of my style.</p>
		<p>I'm a woman</p>
		<p>Phenomenally.</p>
		<p>Phenomenal woman,</p>
		<p>That's me.</p>
<br>
		<p>Now you understand</p>
		<p>Just why my head's not bowed.</p>
		<p>I don't shout or jump about</p>
		<p>Or have to talk real loud.</p>
		<p>When you see me passing</p>
		<p>It ought to make you proud.</p>
		<p>I say,</p>
		<p>It's in the click of my heels,</p>
		<p>The bend of my hair,</p>
		<p>The palm of my hand,</p>
		<p>The need of my care,</p>
		<p>'Cause I'm a woman</p>
		<p>Phenomenally.</p>
		<p>Phenomenal woman,</p>
		<p>That's me.</p>
<br><br>

		<p class="header2">Still I rise</p>
<br>
		<p>You may write me down in history</p>
		<p>With your bitter, twisted lies,</p>
		<p>You may trod me in the very dirt</p>
		<p>But still, like dust, I'll rise.</p>
<br>
		<p>Does my sassiness upset you?</p>
		<p>Why are you beset with gloom?</p>
		<p>'Cause I walk like I've got oil wells</p>
		<p>Pumping in my living room.</p>
<br>
		<p>Just like moons and like suns,</p>
		<p>With the certainty of tides,</p>
		<p>Just like hopes springing high,</p>
		<p>Still I'll rise.</p>
<br>
		<p>Did you want to see me broken?</p>
		<p>Bowed head and lowered eyes?</p>
		<p>Shoulders falling down like teardrops.</p>
		<p>Weakened by my soulful cries.</p>
<br>
		<p>Does my haughtiness offend you?</p>
		<p>Don't you take it awful hard</p>
		<p>'Cause I laugh like I've got gold mines</p>
		<p>Diggin' in my own back yard.</p>
<br>
		<p>You may shoot me with your words,</p>
		<p>You may cut me with your eyes,</p>
		<p>You may kill me with your hatefulness,</p>
		<p>But still, like air, I'll rise.</p>
<br>
		<p>Does my sexiness upset you?</p>
		<p>Does it come as a surprise</p>
		<p>That I dance like I've got diamonds</p>
		<p>At the meeting of my thighs?</p>
<br>
		<p>Out of the huts of history's shame</p>
		<p>I rise</p>
		<p>Up from a past that's rooted in pain</p>
		<p>I rise</p>
		<p>I'm a black ocean, leaping and wide,</p>
		<p>Welling and swelling I bear in the tide.</p>
		<p>Leaving behind nights of terror and fear</p>
		<p>I rise</p>
		<p>Into a daybreak that's wondrously clear</p>
		<p>I rise</p>
		<p>Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,</p>
		<p>I am the dream and the hope of the slave.</p>
		<p>I rise</p>
		<p>I rise</p>
		<p>I rise.</p>

<p class="footnote"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:bold">Maya Angelou</span> born <span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:bold">Marguerite Ann Johnson</span> on April 4, 1928) is an American autobiographer and poet who has been called "America's most visible black female autobiographer" by scholar Joanne M. Braxton. She is best known for her series of six autobiographical volumes, which focus on her childhood and early adulthood experiences. The first, best-known, and most highly acclaimed, <span style="font-style:normal">I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings</span> (1969), focuses on the first seventeen years of her life, brought her international recognition, and was nominated for a National Book Award. Angelou has been highly honored for her body of work, including being awarded over 30 honorary degrees and the nomination of a Pulitzer Prize for her 1971 volume of poetry, <span style="font-style:normal">Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water 'Fore I Diiie.</p>

<p class="footnote">Angelou was a member of the Harlem Writers Guild in the late 1950s, was active in the Civil Rights movement, and served as Northern Coordinator of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s Southern Christian Leadership Conference. Since 1991, Angelou has taught at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, as recipient of the first lifetime Reynolds Professorship of American Studies. Since the 1990s she has made around eighty appearances a year on the lecture circuit. In 1993, she recited her poem "On the Pulse of Morning" at President Bill Clinton's inauguration, the first poet to make an inaugural recitation since Robert Frost at John F. Kennedy's inauguration in 1961. In 1995, she was recognized for having the longest-running record (two years) on <span style="font-style:normal">The New York Times</span> Paperback Nonfiction Bestseller List.</p>

<p class="footnote">With the publication of <span style="font-style:normal">I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings</span>, Angelou was heralded as a new kind of memoirist, one of the first African American women who was able to publicly discuss her personal life. She became recognized and highly respected as a spokesperson for black people and women. Angelou's work is often characterized as autobiographical fiction. Angelou has, however, made a deliberate attempt through her work to challenge the common structure of the autobiography by critiquing, changing, and expanding the genre. Her books, centered on themes such as identity, family, and racism, are often used as set texts in schools and universities internationally. Some of her more controversial work has been challenged or banned in US schools and libraries.</p>
