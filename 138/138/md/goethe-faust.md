# From *Faust*, part I - In Faust\'s Study

## by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe

![](faust.jpg){class="a"}

With hot devotion have I studied\
The law, medicine, philosophy.\
Unfortunately I\'ve been worried\
As well by grim theology.\
Now here I sit like any bore\
No wiser than I was before.\
Master, Doctor I am called,\
But ten years later I\'m appalled\
To find that all my learning knows\
Is to lead my students by the nose.\
I see that we have nothing learned,\
And this my heart has badly burned.\
More clever than the Pope am I,\
Than doctors, judges, priests most high;\
I have no scruples to reveal,\
No hell deters me, nor any Devil.\
All joy from me has long been torn,\
To knowledge have I not been born,\
To ignorance must I now conform,\
Humanity\'s folly I\'ll not reform.\
I neither gold nor goods possess,\
To earthly honor cannot attest.\
No dog would want to live so longer,\
So I\'ve become a magic monger.\
Perhaps the Spirit\'s voice and strength,\
Some secrets will reveal at length,\
So that I no more come and go\
Explaining things I do not know;\
And thus such things to me be told\
That world and life together hold;\
To see all power from the peak\
And not in worthless words to seek.
