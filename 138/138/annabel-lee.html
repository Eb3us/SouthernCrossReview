<h2>By Edgar Allen Poe</h2>

<p class="intro">It was many and many a year ago,<br />
In a kingdom by the sea,<br />
That a maiden there lived whom you may know<br />
By the name of Annabel Lee;<br />
And this maiden she lived with no other thought<br />
Than to love and be loved by me.</p>
<p>I was a child and she was a child,<br />
In this kingdom by the sea,<br />
But we loved with a love that was more than love—<br />
I and my Annabel Lee—<br />
With a love that the wingèd seraphs of Heaven<br />
Coveted her and me.</p>
<p>And this was the reason that, long ago,<br />
In this kingdom by the sea,<br />
A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling<br />
My beautiful Annabel Lee;<br />
So that her highborn kinsmen came<br />
And bore her away from me,<br />
To shut her up in a sepulcher<br />
In this kingdom by the sea.</p>
<p>The angels, not half so happy in Heaven,<br />
Went envying her and me—<br />
Yes!—that was the reason (as all men know,<br />
In this kingdom by the sea)<br />
That the wind came out of the cloud by night,<br />
Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.</p>
<p>But our love it was stronger by far than the love<br />
Of those who were older than we—<br />
Of many far wiser than we—<br />
And neither the angels in Heaven above<br />
Nor the demons down under the sea<br />
Can ever dissever my soul from the soul<br />
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;</p>
<p>For the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams<br />
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;<br />
And the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes<br />
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;<br />
And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side<br />
Of my darling—my darling—my life and my bride,<br />
In her sepulcher there by the sea—<br />
In her tomb by the sounding sea.</p>
