<p class="intro">It was raining the first time I saw my tower<br />
That is, the first time I saw it in reality<br />
In my mind I'd seen it many times before<br />
Standing by the ocean, looking out of a train window at night<br />
Even the structure I made with blocks as a child was this same tower<br />
That long ago.<br>
My heart beat faster than the raindrops<br />
As I looked up and saw it painted against the sky.<br />
The outside of the building was as beautiful as the outside of anything can be<br />
But the inside was pure enchantment.</p>

<p>The elevator operator was Merlin,<br />
My feet touched the magic carpet,<br />
As I ran down the hall<br />
And the key that I turned in the lock was Aladdin's lamp</p>

<p>As I entered the tower for the first time I knew that at last I had found contentment<br />
A home that I would leave many times yet never really leave<br />
I went over to the window and looked out at my beloved town<br />
The buildings were constant flames, bright, shining, stronger than the rain<br />
And on the street below were the people that built that fire and kept it alive<br />
Nine million keepers of the flame<br>
The sound of traffic on a New York street creates a strange music<br />
It's an orchestra conducted by the Statue of Liberty<br />
Where the words ingrained forever on her side<br />
It's a great organ played upon by Father Knickerbocker, master organist.<br />
I opened my tower windows wide to let the music in:<br />
Uptown, Downtown, Chinatown, Harlem, Broadway,</p>
Times Square<br> 
Broadway, Broadway, Broadway</p> 

<p>The Statue of Liberty:<br />
“Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses<br />
Yearning to breathe free<br />
The wretched refuse of your teaming shores<br />
Send these the tempest-tossed to me<br />
I lift my lamp beside the golden door.”</p>
