So loved as no one<br>
Will ever love her again.</em></p>

<p>This poem was written in Spanish many years ago when the author lived in Spain, where I met him, became his friend and translated his poem. &quot;Alma&quot; in Spanish, besides being a woman's name, means &quot;soul&quot;. This is lost in translation, at least if the reader does not keep it in mind. Unfortunately, I no longer have the original</p>

	<p><span style="color:#690520;font-size:200%">A</span>lma,<br />
after all<br />
that has been between us,<br />
after all<br />
we have already said,<br />
not even I know<br />
why I am writing to you,<br />
but I cannot omit doing so,<br />
and I am sending you this<br />
as the last<br />
of my letters.</p>
<p>Mi life and my deeds,<br />
although on everyone's lips,<br />
are disdained and wasted.<br />
If they did not know the truth,<br />
though as in a dream,<br />
they would have no guilt.<br />
But now they know<br />
and are guilty,<br />
thereby profaning my love.</p>
<p>You also,<br />
Alma,<br />
if you did not know the truth<br />
would have no guilt.<br />
But you know what a hard and long offering<br />
my coming still is.</p>
<p>My time has<br />
not yet been consumed;<br />
yours, Alma,<br />
is ripe for harvest.</p>
<p>A bit longer<br />
and my time will come,<br />
a bit longer<br />
and yours<br />
will have ended.<br />
Then, poor you,<br />
the long winter will come,<br />
the silence,<br />
the loneliness,<br />
the inexorable sentence.</p>
<p>I do not cease to grieve<br />
over the same question:<br />
What has become of the smiles,<br />
the promises<br />
and the White Weddng Gown?</p>
<p>Oh, what sadness you bring me!<br />
How could you ever forget<br />
our pact of blood?<br />
If you don't believe in me<br />
and if your memory fails you<br />
ask your blood<br />
in which abundantly flows mine.<br />
Then perhaps you will awaken<br />
from the enchantment<br />
that enfolds you in<br />
mournful mist.</p>
<p>What kind of love is yours?<br />
You invoke me only at low tide.<br />
When happiness<br />
glows in your eyes<br />
you forget me.</p>
<p>You call me<br />
only in the terrible hours<br />
when it is intolerable<br />
to digest all the poison<br />
and it becomes impossible<br />
to transform it into food.<br />
I, here, always at your feet,<br />
humiliating myself with the hope<br />
of a glance.</p>
<p>A single glance would suffice<br />
for your heart<br />
to glow<br />
as mine glows <br />
and you don't dare to even raise your eyes.<br />
Why should you fear me?<br />
I love you<br />
more than myself,<br />
above myself,<br />
and I live to the degree<br />
that you live,<br />
be it in pleasure<br />
or even more so in pain.</p>
<p>Before it is<br />
too late,<br />
I beg you, Alma,<br />
look at me.<br />
Dare to look at me!<br />
Though it be only once<br />
have the courage to look at me<br />
and you will be forever safe,<br />
and you will be forever spouse.</p>
<p>You see<br />
that at each invocation<br />
I resort to the same hope<br />
that at last<br />
you will notice me:<br />
me,<br />
who alleviates sorrow,<br />
me,<br />
who heals wounds,<br />
me,<br />
who forgives debts and debtors.<br />
Then you complain<br />
that I am responsible<br />
for all your unhappiness,<br />
when I am the only bearer<br />
of all goodness.</p>
Mine are the valleys<br />
which you inhabit –<br />
valleys once fertile<br />
with wheat and flocks<br />
which you have turned to wasteland<br />
through indifference.<br />
Mine are the rivers,<br />
the blue seas,<br />
the winter pastures and forests.<br />
Mine are the mines<br />
of gold and silver,<br />
mine are the mines<br />
of the sun and the moon.<br />
All this<br />
and still more than this<br />
has been entrusted me by my father.<br />
I have given it to you,<br />
to you whom I love<br />
as no one has loved,<br />
to you whom I love<br />
as no one ever<br />
will love again.</p>

<p>Ingrate,<br />
you still call me<br />
only when nightmares<br />
impede your sleep,<br />
when you are thirsty,<br />
when you are hungry<br />
or when fear suffocates you.<br />
You never invite me<br />
when your table is set<br />
with good food and wines.<br />
Just the other day<br />
when I appeared for a moment<br />
as you sang and laughed<br />
you threw me out<br />
like the least of beggars,<br />
calling me a wet blanket<br />
me, who enjoyed the gaiety<br />
more than any of your guests.</p>

<p>I do not conceal from you<br />
that I am desolate,<br />
more desolate than ever.<br />
I cannot hide from you<br />
that the cup<br />
- as proclaimed by<br />
the mother of all mothers –<br />
is full.<br />
So full<br />
that one more drop<br />
and it will overflow.</p>
<p>As within a bottomless pit,<br />
with a rhythm of bells<br />
that ring to death,<br />
the night is falling.<br />
Never has been seen to fall<br />
such a black night,<br />
such an abundance<br />
of horrible forebodings.</p>
<p>The thread of days<br />
has broken<br />
and all returns<br />
toward its origin.<br />
Nations are known who,<br />
inflamed by hate,<br />
traverse the land<br />
to kill themselves in war.<br />
Others are known<br />
who venerate a beast<br />
so poisonous<br />
that to look at it<br />
is to be fulminated<br />
in the same instant.<br />
I could tell you<br />
of still others<br />
who, possessed<br />
by sad prophesies,<br />
have delivered themselves up to death,<br />
piercing their breasts with long knives.<br />
The noble ones,<br />
having abandoned their clean dwellings,<br />
changed their vestments<br />
of silks and jewels for tatters,<br />
have withdrawn to the desert<br />
to expiate their guilt.<br />
Certain sailors<br />
swear to have seen<br />
fish flying high over the sea<br />
and birds of earth<br />
swoop down against surging waves.<br />
Visions and fears<br />
torment the sleep<br />
of the venerable ancients,<br />
children prophesize,<br />
women are changed to stone,<br />
men adore the abomination<br />
placed in the holy place<br />
and, the other day,<br />
crows<br />
with their black wings<br />
stirred up a fire in a brazier<br />
to burn in its hollows<br />
broods of white doves.<br />
The light is withdrawing,<br />
innumerable<br />
will be the darknesses and,<br />
while the false prophets<br />
announce the end of the world,<br />
an incredible multitude,<br />
pressed against the portals<br />
of the temple,<br />
lies down in fear<br />
longing for the new good.</p>
<p>Alma, these days are<br />
like ferocious thieves, savage hoards led<br />
by pestilence and hunger,<br />
like vultures attracted<br />
by the stench of dead flesh<br />
that descend toward the regions<br />
where time ends.<br />
Regions<br />
which still keep me exiled,<br />
the fault<br />
-if one can speak of fault - <br />
of my incomparable love.</p>
<p>Alma, these are days of ill-omen:<br />
homes where flowers<br />
whither at once,<br />
cripples who moan<br />
their ill-fated slow daily lament.<br />
These are days<br />
when the blind<br />
are about to see<br />
and those who think they see<br />
will become blind.<br />
These days are<br />
like opaque walls<br />
that separate the night from the day,<br />
like ships adrift<br />
without direction<br />
while the harps<br />
are so hungry for caresses<br />
and so few dare to play them<br />
for fear of going mad.</p>
<p>Listen,<br />
Alma, the more<br />
the torment of passion<br />
pushes you in pursuit of the footprints<br />
of infinite signs<br />
the more will it be impossible<br />
to find the road<br />
which leads to me,<br />
for you have never received me<br />
as I am naked,<br />
for you never<br />
have let me sleep<br />
in the warmth of your being,<br />
for you never<br />
have wanted to console me<br />
for my long exile.</p>
<p>Be careful of the games<br />
of exquisite and subtle traps.<br />
You are incarnating me so much<br />
that your arms are<br />
You invest strange tales<br />
where inhuman creatures<br />
soothe infernal deliriums,<br />
while I long<br />
for the beats of your heart<br />
to merge themselves in mine<br />
and that you<br />
finally feel saturated<br />
in the nuptial embrace.</p>
<p>Alma,<br />
Alma,<br />
I yearn so for your love,<br />
even more now<br />
when love<br />
is ending<br />
in the world –<br />
and you do nothing<br />
but come and go<br />
from the stars to the flesh,<br />
from the flesh to the stars.<br />
In order not to die of tedium<br />
you have begun,<br />
with infinite astuteness,<br />
to compose of me<br />
crossword puzzles<br />
in order to make the truth<br />
an insoluble charade.</p>
<p>Oh, before eternity are condemned<br />
the murderers of the roses!<br />
Eternally damned<br />
are the tormentors of the iridescent<br />
butterflies!</p>
<p>... Love is ending<br />
in the world ...<br />
to which loyal spouse will I deliver<br />
our inner son?</p>
<p>Crippled,<br />
you cannot remove the nails,<br />
nor can I completely<br />
crucify you<br />
without you wanting it –<br />
so why do you waste the years<br />
wandering from the stars to the flesh<br />
and from the flesh to the stars?</p>
<p>Wake up, Alma,<br />
the blind are about to see<br />
and those who think they see<br />
nevermore,<br />
nevermore,<br />
nevermore will see.</p>
<p>Decide,<br />
and let us live the dance<br />
of most perfect love!<br />
My father<br />
has waited centuries for us,<br />
my mother<br />
has waited centuries for us,<br />
the rainbow<br />
has waited centuries for us,<br />
and still you reproach me<br />
that you did not choose me<br />
but I selected you.</p>
<p>So be it:<br />
I am seeking so<br />
that I consume myself<br />
and can do no less<br />
than consume myself more<br />
seeking you.<br />
I have beseeched you so much<br />
that in my mouth<br />
and on my hands I have wounds<br />
whose blood will not encrust.</p>
<p>I NEED YOU, ALMA:<br />
without you, I am a widower,<br />
without you, I am an orphan,<br />
without you, I have no arms,<br />
nor do I have feet,<br />
nor do I have eyes.<br />
YOU NEED ME, ALMA:<br />
without me, you have no life,<br />
without me, your arms give no warmth,<br />
without me, your feet walk not,<br />
without me, your eyes see not.<br />
If you do not yet fear<br />
it's because I still seek you.</p>
<p>I NEED YOU, ALMA,<br />
TO SEAL THE ROYAL MARRIAGE<br />
WITH MY STIGMATA.<br />
Bewitched,<br />
of which water<br />
from which fountain<br />
would you drink<br />
the arrogance<br />
of your beautiful adolescence,<br />
to deceive yourself<br />
like precious pearls<br />
thrown to the swine?<br />
Find out.<br />
Although you've sold me<br />
a million times<br />
you can never forget my name.<br />
Contemplate<br />
how high it is in the sky<br />
and how deep it is in the earth:<br />
my name,<br />
no one can ever<br />
erase it,<br />
my name,<br />
hear how sweet it is,<br />
how perfect it is,<br />
complete,<br />
free.</p>
<p>Too tied to the wheel<br />
of infinite returns,<br />
if instead of understanding me<br />
you would try to experience me<br />
how much we could do together<br />
of all that I have done alone.<br />
By not knowing me<br />
greater is the pain,<br />
louder is the scream,<br />
for in penetrating you so<br />
I pain you more.</p>
<p>How often have I told you<br />
of my long vigil<br />
in the orchard of agony?<br />
If I had no other choice<br />
for myself<br />
how could I have one<br />
for you, little Alma,<br />
so tied to the earth!</p>
<p>But soon,<br />
on the day of the living flames,<br />
you also will walk<br />
on the mountain of skulls.<br />
I will come for you,<br />
and when I do<br />
will you recognize me?<br />
will you be able to accept me<br />
with the kiss which receives<br />
the impulse of life?</p>
<p>Forgetful one,<br />
from which fountains<br />
of which springs<br />
would you extract<br />
the water of life,<br />
if I am the spring,<br />
if I am the life?<br />
In which devoted disciple<br />
do you confide<br />
at the hour of convulsions<br />
if I am wisdom,<br />
if I am devotion?<br />
To which saint would you<br />
raise your prayers<br />
if I am sanctity,<br />
if I am prayer?<br />
And you still know not<br />
how to pray?<br />
It is useless<br />
to scrutinize the horizon<br />
expecting beings<br />
from other worlds<br />
or that a multitude<br />
of shining angels<br />
come to save you,<br />
for I am the horizon,<br />
I am salvation!<br />
In truth it is useless<br />
to seek more,<br />
for I AM THE MORE.<br />
I am the mother<br />
who kissed your cheeks<br />
furrowed with tears,<br />
I am the father<br />
with his firm gentleness,<br />
I am the brother who<br />
reveals to you the symbols<br />
of dreams.</p>
<p>You do nothing but flee.<br />
To flee, but<br />
to where will you flee<br />
that you have not already flown?</p>
<p>To what new frontier<br />
of the universe<br />
would you go<br />
where I cannot reach you<br />
if I wish?<br />
On what new shores<br />
would you land<br />
where I cannot await you<br />
– if I wish?</p>
<p>I, the only one who can heal<br />
the wounds of your clipped wings!<br />
In which deep abyss<br />
submerge,<br />
in what opium smoke away the boredom<br />
of the waiting days?<br />
To which false charm succumb<br />
with desperate mind<br />
to which I, if I wish,<br />
cannot be even madder?</p>
<p>Friends,<br />
adventures,<br />
distant beauty,<br />
there is no corner<br />
where you can conceal yourself<br />
ALIVE OR DEAD<br />
and where, if I wish,<br />
I cannot revive in you,<br />
still more potent,<br />
still more tremendous.</p>
<p>For all the plots<br />
and exorcisms<br />
you can arrange,<br />
for all the dates<br />
you miss<br />
you cannot avoid<br />
my absolute love,<br />
my absolute pain.<br />
My pain is forever<br />
and for ever:<br />
galaxies have been born<br />
and have extinguished<br />
feeding upon my pain,<br />
pain which will always<br />
find you again<br />
awaiting the day of the living flames,<br />
on which you will welcome me.</p>

<center>* * *</center>

<p>You are welcome,<br />
for now I know who you are:<br />
you are the divine spouse,<br />
you are the absolute pain<br />
which feeds the spirit of things.  It is you<br />
who makes comprehensible<br />
the way<br />
and walks in unison<br />
with life and death,<br />
and from death generates life.<br />
Twenty centuries<br />
did not suffice to know you<br />
while flowers carried you on their stems.</p>
<p>Nuptial alliance:<br />
you are welcome,<br />
for you are the transmutation,<br />
the fecundation,<br />
the height,<br />
the depth,<br />
the alpha and the omega.<br />
You are welcome,<br />
for you are the life<br />
of my flesh,<br />
the breath of my blood,<br />
you who makes grow<br />
the plants from the earth<br />
and melts the snowflakes.<br />
You are welcome,<br />
for you are not the cross<br />
but him who leads me<br />
to it,<br />
teaching me<br />
the new prayer:</p>
<p>I LOVE YOU<br />
BY YOUR REAL NAME<br />
BECAUSE OF ALL<br />
THAT IS BORN AND DIES<br />
YOU ARE THE ONE<br />
WHO NEVER DIES.</p>
