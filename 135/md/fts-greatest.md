# I Am the Greatest

*The greatest love of all\
Is easy to achieve,\
Learning to love yourself\
It is the greatest love of all.*

*Whitney Houston song*

I dreamed of being the greatest at
*something*. Why? In order not to
be a second fiddle or, worse,
*nothing*. Who do we read about
in the newspapers and drool at on TV and talk about at parties?
Those who are the best at their chosen endeavors. We may of course
also admire someone who is second or even third best, but not with
the same ardor. We just nod: yeah, nice try, but no banana. I
wanted to be talked about, admired, famous, maybe even star in a
movie as Captain America.

When I realized that my goal in life was to be the greatest at
something, I first had to decide what I could be best at, the
greatest. The logical approach was to choose something I like and
concentrate on perfecting that activity to the exclusion of all
else.

I made a list: basketball -- the only sport I was reasonably good
at. But it\'s absurd to think that a five-foot-seven-inch white
dwarf (by NBA standards) could become the world\'s greatest
player. Ditto for other sports, for which I lacked the necessary
physical endowments.

I wasn\'t bad a chess, but Bobby Fisher became the U.S. champion
at fourteen, the age I learned the rules. The Russians begin in
kindergarten. Writer? You should have seen this paper before my
computer\'s spelling program took over. It found errors in my
errors. I liked watching movies, but I\'m not the hero type and I
wouldn\'t like to play villains.

For a while I was stymied, until it came to me in a dream in
which I saw myself at the pinnacle of success and fame doing what
I do best.

I began to practice, an arduous process. It took three years to
perfect my technique to the point where I was sure that I was the
best in the world. I am listed by Guinness, countless magazine
articles have been written about me, I appear on TV regularly, my
you-tube video has broken all viewing records and my secretary
dedicates three days a week just turning down proposals from women
looking for the perfect lover.

My economic future is assured by an exclusive contract with the
world\'s leading mattress company, for whom I make glowing
endorsements. And my eulogies are genuine; their mattresses are
the best, and I should know, for I am the world\'s greatest
sleeper.

I sleep twenty-three hours a day, scientifically verified of
course. I need the remaining hour for eating my one daily meal and
other bodily functions. I remain awake one day a month in order to
sign checks and contracts, grant interviews and other necessary
trivia. I have considered the use of intravenous feeding, which
would allow me to sleep without interruption, but decided that
artificial support would taint my achievement.

Do I still dream? Why should I? I am the greatest.

One week later: This bio-tale was ready for publication when I had
a dream after all. So even the world's greatest sleeper cannot
completely avoid dreams. I was asleep in the dream, alone in my
king-size bed, fit for the greatest, when a figure suddenly
appeared at the foot of the bed. At first I thought it must be an
angel or a demon, but then I saw that it was me...of all people. I
kept my eyes shut, pretending that I was still sleeping -- in the
dream, that is. But I -- the figure in the dream -- pulled the
cover off and literally kicked me out of bed.

I said to me: What are you doing to us?

He answered: Get our ass out of bed, you lazy jerk, there's stuff
to do in the world.

What stuff? I asked me.

If I knew that, I'd tell us. So you'll just have to wake the fuck
up and find out.

I woke up when the summer sun brushed my eyes gently. Since then I
am no longer the greatest at anything. But I am awake, which is
more than can be said about most people, who don't even realize
they are asleep.
