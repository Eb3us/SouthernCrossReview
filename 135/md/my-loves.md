# My Loves

## by Langston Hughes

I love to see the big white moon, \
  A-shining in the sky;\
I love to see the little stars, \
  When the shadow clouds go by.

I love the rain drops falling\
  On my roof-top in the night;\
I love the soft wind's sighing, \
  Before the dawn's gray light.

I love the deepness of the blue, \
  In my Lord's heaven above; \
But better than all these things I think, \
  I love my lady love.
