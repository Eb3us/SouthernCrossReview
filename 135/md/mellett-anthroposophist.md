MODERN ANTHROPOSOPHIST:\
I am the very model of a modern Anthroposophist,\
I've information mineral, etheric, astral, egoist.\
Atlantis and Lemuria, the Mystery of Golgotha,\
With Ahriman and Lucifer, the science of the spiritual.

CHORUS:\
Atlantis and Lemuria, the Mystery of Golgotha,\
With Ahriman and Lucifer, the science of the spiritual.

MODERN ANTHROPOSOPHIST:\
I visit Dornach every year as if it were the Vatican\
The Goetheanum is my temple though I am American\
I don't know that much German but I want to keep on learnin'\
And my heart is really yearnin' knowin' Steiner is returnin'.

CHORUS:\
He doesn't know much German but he wants to keep on learnin'\
And his heart is really yearnin' knowin' Steiner is returnin'.

MODERN ANTHROPOSOPHIST:\
I want to save the world from Ahriman and his materialism\
But then I get so caught up in my Luciferic egotism\
I never know what I should do, the feelings that I should imbue\
What Steiner says, it must be true. The Christ Impulse? I have no clue!

CHORUS:

He never knows what he should do, the feelings that he should imbue\
What Steiner says, it must be true. The Christ Impulse? He has no clue!\
In short, in matters mineral, etheric, astral, egoist\
He is the very model of a modern Anthroposophist.

MODERN ANTHROPOSOPHIST:\
I see the elementals in the forest when I meditate\
The gnomes and sylphs and undines, salamanders in the aggregate.\
I don't know what they want of me, this might just be insanity\
But Steiner teaches me to see behind the veil of reality.

CHORUS:\
I don't know what they want of me, this might just be insanity\
But Steiner teaches me to see behind the veil of reality.

MODERN ANTHROPOSOPHIST:\
I've done the exercises to attain my equanimity\
But when a critic comes around in any close proximity\
I hesitate and vacillate, I complicate and obfuscate\
Deflect that Steiner said it --- hey, that's all I can communicate.

CHORUS:\
He hesitates and vacillates, he complicates and obfuscates\
Deflects that Steiner said it --- hey, that's all he can communicate.\
In short, in matters mineral, etheric, astral, egoist,\
He is the very model of a modern Anthroposophist.

MODERN ANTHROPOSOPHIST:\
Philosophy of Freedom is a book I've never, ever read\
To think about my thinking makes me sick and achy in the head\
I'd rather reincarnate as a woman or a refugee\
Than ever have to read a book about epistemology.

CHORUS:\
He'd rather reincarnate as a woman or a refugee\
Than ever have to read a book about epistemology.

MODERN ANTHROPOSOPHIST:\
\[*slower tempo here, getting wistful*\]

The three-fold nature of the human being is a mystery . . .\
And so are all the moves and gestures that I make eurythmically. . . .\
The critics tell me Steiner is a madman and a racist, too. . . .\
His medicine is quackery, his claims of science just woo woo. . . .\
But all I care about is finding which of four's my temperament, . ..\
So I can know my destiny and finally reach enlightenment . . .

\[*back to quick tempo for finale*\]

I don't know if I'm sanguine or choleric, melancholic\
So I must be a phlegmatic 'cause I am a chocoholic.

CHORUS:\
He doesn't know if sanguine or choleric, melancholic\
So he must be a phlegmatic 'cause he is a chocoholic.

MODERN ANTHROPOSOPHIST:\
In short in matters mineral, etheric, astral, egoist\
I am the very model of a modern Anthroposophist.

CHORUS:\
In short, in matters mineral, etheric, astral, egoist\
He is the very model of a modern Anthroposophist.

Ladies and gentlemen of the Steiner Internet Universe!

I humbly offer you now the opening lyrics of an anthroposophical song
parody that I have composed. Again, with all bashfulness and modesty, I
must say that it is a song parody of the deepest and most profound
"World Historical Significance" (WHS) in the entire evolutionary
development of humanity in the modern world to date. The music for the
original song was created by the British composer of Irish-Italian
descent, Sir Arthur Seymour Sullivan (1842--1900) and the lyrics created
by famed librettist, Sir William Schwenck Gilbert (1836--1911). The song
I have parodied is from their most popular opera "The Pirates of
Penzance." and is entitled "I am the Very Model of a Modern Major
General."

Anthroposophically yours,

Major General Tom Mellett
