<h3>Arming Israel Still Has Bipartisan Support in Washington</h3>
<h2>By <a href="https://tomdispatch.com/authors/stan-cox/">Stan Cox</a></h2>


</header>

<main>
<p class="intro">In recent weeks, political soothsayers have speculated about a wide
variety of odious new policies the incoming Trump administration and its
allies in Congress may or may not pursue. No one can predict with
certainty which of those measures they will inflict on us and which
they’ll forget about.  But we can make one prediction with utter
confidence. The White House and large bipartisan majorities in Congress
will continue their lavish support for Israel’s war on Gaza, however
catastrophic the results.   </p>
<p>Washington has supplied a large share of the armaments that have
allowed the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) to rain death and destruction
on Gaza (not to speak of Lebanon) over the past year and a quarter.
Before October 7, 2023, when Hamas and other groups attacked southern
Israel, that country was receiving $3.8 billion worth of American
military aid annually. Since then, the floodgates have opened and <a
href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/10/30/us-weapons-israel-gaza-civilian-deaths/">$18
billion</a> worth of arms have flowed out. The ghastly results have
shocked people and governments across the globe.</p>
<p>In early 2024, the United Nations General Assembly and International
Court of Justice <a
href="https://www.icj-cij.org/node/203447">condemned</a> the war being
waged on the people of Gaza and, in November, the International Criminal
Court issued <a
href="https://www.reuters.com/world/icc-issues-arrest-warrants-israels-netanyahu-gallant-hamas-leader-2024-11-21/">arrest
warrants</a> for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister
Yoav Gallant for war crimes and crimes against humanity. Amnesty
International, Human Rights Watch, the European Center for
Constitutional and Human Rights, and Médecins Sans Frontières all
followed with determinations that Israel was indeed <a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/dec/23/israel-gaza-war-genocide-where-is-the-action?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=bluesky&amp;CMP=bsky_gu">committing
genocide</a>.</p>
<p>This country’s laws and regulations prohibit aid to military forces
deliberately killing or wounding civilians or committing other grave
human rights abuses. No matter, the U.S.-to-Israel weapons pipeline has
kept right on flowing, completely unchecked. A cornucopia of military
funds and hardware for Israel in the early months of the war came from
just two nations: <a
href="https://thedefensepost.com/2024/03/26/us-germany-israel-weapons/">69%</a>
from the United States and 30% from Germany.</p>
<p>Were it just about any other country than Israel committing such a
genocide, Washington would have cut off arms shipments months ago. But
U.S. leaders have long carved out gaping exceptions for Israel. Those
policies have contributed mightily to the lethality of the onslaught,
which has so far killed at least 52,000 Palestinians, <a
href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GcSCjKsW0AAdFzA?format=jpg&amp;name=medium">46,000
of whom</a> are believed to have been civilians. And of those civilian
dead, five of every six are also believed to have been women or
children. Israeli air strikes and other kinds of bombardment have also
destroyed or severely damaged almost <a
href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GcSCjKsW0AAdFzA?format=jpg&amp;name=medium">half
a million</a> housing units, more than 500 schools, just about every
hospital in Gaza, and large parts of that region’s food and water
systems — all with dire consequences for health and life.</p>
<p><strong>Bombs Leave Their Calling Cards</strong></p>
<p>From October 2023 through October 2024, <a
href="https://www.propublica.org/article/israel-gaza-america-biden-administration-weapons-bombs-state-department">reports</a>
Brett Murphy at <em>ProPublica</em>, 50,000 tons (yes, tons!) of U.S.
war matériel were shipped to Israel. A partial list of the munitions <a
href="https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/files/cow/imce/papers/2023/2024/Costs%20of%20War_US%20Support%20Since%20Oct%207%20FINAL%20v2.pdf">included</a>
in those shipments has been compiled by the Costs of War Project. The
list (which, the project stresses, is far from complete) includes 2,600
250-pound bombs, 8,700 500-pound bombs, and a trove of 16,000 behemoths,
each weighing in at 2,000 pounds. In January 2024, Washington also added
to Israel’s inventory of U.S.-made F-15 and F-35 <a
href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/16/middleeast/where-israel-get-its-weapons/index.html">fighter
jets</a>. Naturally, we taxpayers footed the bill.</p>
<p>As Abigail Hauslohner and Michael Birnbaum of the <em>Washington
Post</em> <a
href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/10/30/us-weapons-israel-gaza-civilian-deaths/">noted</a>
in late October, “The pace and volume of weaponry have meant that U.S.
munitions make up a substantial portion of Israel’s arsenal, with an
American-made fleet of warplanes to deliver the heaviest bombs to their
targets.” When confronted with solid evidence that Israel has been using
U.S. military aid to commit genocide, National Security Adviser Jake
Sullivan <a
href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jake-sullivan-national-security-adviser-face-the-nation-transcript-06-09-2024/">told</a>
reporters, “We do not have enough information to reach definitive
conclusions about particular incidents or to make legal
determinations.”</p>
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0872868060/ref=nosim/?tag=tomdispatch-20">
<div class="polaroid">
<img class="b" src="green-new-deal-bc.png" alt="The Green New Deal and Beyond by Stan Cox" style="width:100%">
<div class="container"><p>Buy the Book!</p></div></div></a>
<p>Really? How much information would be enough then? Isn’t it
sufficient to see Israeli forces repeatedly target clinics, homes,
hospitals, mosques, and schools with massive, precision-guided bombs?
Isn’t it enough when the IDF targets the very “<a
href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/israel-gaza-safe-zones-turned-graveyards-how">safe
zones</a>” in which they have commanded civilians to take shelter, or
when they repeatedly bomb and strafe places where people have <a
href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/09/middleeast/gaza-food-aid-convoy-deaths-eyewitness-intl-investigation-cmd/index.html">gathered
around aid trucks</a> to try to obtain some small portion of the trickle
of food that the Israeli government led by Netanyahu has decided to
allow into Gaza?</p>
<p>If the U.S. State Department’s analysts really were having trouble
making “definitive conclusions about particular incidents,” then Stephan
Semler was ready to lend a hand with a report at the Quincy Institute
for Responsible Statecraft entitled “<a
href="https://responsiblestatecraft.org/us-weapons-gaza/">20 Times
Israel Used U.S. Arms in Likely War Crimes</a>.” Worse yet, his list, he
points out, represents only “a small fraction of potential war crimes
committed with U.S.-provided weapons,” and all 20 of the attacks he
focuses on occurred at locations where no armed resistance forces seemed
to be present. Here are a few incidents <a
href="https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/documents/countries/opt/20240619-ohchr-thematic-report-indiscrim-disprop-attacks-gaza-oct-dec2023.pdf#page=7">from
the list</a>:</p>
<p>When warplanes bombed a busy market in northern Gaza’s Jabalya
refugee camp, killing 69 people in October 2023, U.N. investigators
determined that U.S.-made 2,000-pound GBU-31 air-dropped munitions had
been used. A couple of weeks later, the U.N. found that “several”
GBU-31s were responsible for flattening a built-up area of more than
60,000 square feet within Gaza City, killing 91 people, 39 of them
children. A weapon dropped on a residential building last January,
killing 18 (including 10 children), left behind a fragment identifying
it as a 250-pound Boeing GBU-39. An airstrike on a tent camp for
displaced people in Rafah in May, killing 46 people, left behind a
GBU-39 tailfin made in Colorado. The next month, a bomb-navigating
device manufactured by Honeywell was found in the rubble of a U.N.-run
school where 40 people, including 23 women and children, had been
killed. In July, more than 90 people were slaughtered in a bombing of
the Al-Mawasi refugee camp, an Israeli army-designated “safe zone” near
the southwest corner of Gaza. A tailfin found on the scene came from a
U.S.-built JDAM guidance system that’s commonly used on 1,000- or
2,000-pound bombs. Also in July, fragments of the motor and guidance
system of a Lockheed-Martin Hellfire missile fired from a U.S.-made
Apache helicopter were found in the remains of a U.N.-run school where
refugees were sheltering. Twenty-two had been killed in the attack.</p>
<p><strong>“Everyone Knew the Rules Were Different for
Israel”</strong></p>
<p>In December, a group of Palestinians and Palestinian-Americans filed
a <a
href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/09/middleeast/gaza-food-aid-convoy-deaths-eyewitness-intl-investigation-cmd/index.html">lawsuit</a>
in federal court accusing the State Department of violating a 1997 act
of Congress that prohibits arms transfers to any government that commits
gross human rights violations.</p>
<p>As the* Guardian<em> <a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/18/us-supply-weapons-israel-alleged-abuses-human-rights">reported,</a>
a large number of countries “have privately been sanctioned and faced
consequences for committing human rights violations” under the act,
which is known as the “Leahy law” after its original sponsor, former
Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont. But since 2020, a special committee,
the Israel Leahy Vetting Forum (ILVF), has decided whether payments or
shipments destined for Israel should be permitted. According to the
</em>Guardian*, Israel has “benefited from extraordinary policies inside
the ILVF,” under which arms transfers get a green light no matter how
egregiously Israeli occupation forces may have violated human rights. In
the words of a former official, “Nobody said it, but everyone knew the
rules were different for Israel.”</p>
<p><a
href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/10/30/us-weapons-israel-gaza-civilian-deaths/">According
to</a> the <em>Post</em>’s Abigail Hauslohner and Michael Birnbaum, the
process of determining whether Israel is using U.S.-supplied weapons to
commit war crimes “has become functionally irrelevant, with more senior
leaders at the State Department broadly dismissive of non-Israeli
sources and unwilling to sign off on action plans” for disallowing aid.
A midlevel department official, once stationed in Jerusalem, told
<em>Post</em> reporters that senior officials “often dismissed the
credibility of Palestinian sources, eyewitness accounts, nongovernmental
organizations… and even the United Nations.” So, the arms have continued
flowing, with no letup in sight.</p>
<p>In January 2024, Jack Lew, the Biden administration’s ambassador to
Israel, sent a <a
href="https://www.propublica.org/article/israel-gaza-america-biden-administration-weapons-bombs-state-department">cable</a>
to top State Department officials urging that they approve the IDF’s
request for thousands of GBU-39 bombs. Lew noted that those weapons were
more precise and had a smaller blast radius than the 2,000-pound “dumb
bombs” Israel had been dropping in the war’s early months. Furthermore,
he claimed, their air force had a “decades-long proven track record” of
avoiding civilian deaths when using the GBU-39.</p>
<p>That was, unfortunately, pure eyewash. At the time of the cable,
Amnesty International had already <a
href="https://www.amnestyusa.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/4.29.2024-NSM-20-AIUSA-submission-re-Israel.pdf">shown</a>
that the Israeli Defense Forces were killing civilians with GBU-39s. The
State Department nevertheless accepted Lew’s claims and approved the
sale, paving the way for even more missiles and bombs to rain down on
Palestinians. In reporting on the Lew cable, <em>ProPublica</em>’s Brett
Murphy <a
href="https://www.propublica.org/article/israel-gaza-america-biden-administration-weapons-bombs-state-department">wrote</a>,
“While the U.S. hoped that the smaller bombs would prevent unnecessary
deaths, experts in the laws of war say the size of the bomb doesn’t
matter if it kills more civilians than the military target justifies.”
That principle implies that when there is no military target, an attack
causing even one civilian casualty should be charged as a war crime.</p>
<p>During 2024, with its unrelenting bombardment of Gaza and then
Lebanon, too, Israel chewed rapidly through its munition stocks. The
Biden administration came to the rescue in late November by approving <a
href="https://www.aa.com.tr/en/americas/biden-administration-provisionally-approves-680m-in-weapon-sales-to-israel-following-lebanon-cease-fire-deal/3406835">$680
million</a> in additional munitions deliveries to Israel — and that was
just the appetizer. This month, ignoring Israel’s 15 months of brutal
attacks on Gaza’s population, the administration notified Congress of
plans to provide <a
href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/congress-is-notified-by-the-biden-administration-of-a-planned-8-billion-weapons-sale-to-israel/ar-AA1wXiw7"><em>$8
billion</em></a> worth of additional arms, including Hellfire missiles,
long-range 155-millimeter artillery shells, 500-pound bombs, and much
more.</p>
<p><strong>Big Death Tolls Come in Small Packages</strong></p>
<p>International bodies have accused Israel of using not only
bombardment but also direct starvation as a weapon, which would qualify
as yet another kind of war crime. In early 2024, responding to pressure
from advocacy groups, Joe Biden signed a national security memo
designated <a
href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2024/02/08/national-security-memorandum-on-safeguards-and-accountability-with-respect-to-transferred-defense-articles-and-defense-services/">NSM-20</a>.
It required the State Department to halt the provision of armaments to
any country arbitrarily restricting the delivery of food, medical
supplies, or other humanitarian aid to the civilian population of an
area where that country is using those armaments. But the memo has made
virtually no difference.</p>
<p>In April, the two top federal authorities on humanitarian aid — the
U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and the State
Department’s refugee bureau — submitted reports showing that Israel had
indeed deliberately blocked food and medical shipments into Gaza. Under
NSM-20, such actions should have triggered a cutoff of arms shipments to
the offending country. But when the reports touched off a surge of
outrage among the department’s rank and file and demands for an arms
embargo, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and other top brass
steamrolled all objections and approved continued shipments, <a
href="https://www.propublica.org/article/gaza-palestine-israel-blocked-humanitarian-aid-blinken">according
to</a> Brett Murphy of <em>ProPublica</em>.</p>
<p>Another dimension of Israel’s war-by-starvation has been illustrated
and quantified in a spatial analysis published by the British-based
group Forensic Architecture. See, for example, the maps and text on
pages 252–258 of <a
href="https://content.forensic-architecture.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/FA_A-Spatial-Analysis-of-the-Israeli-militarys-conduct-in-Gaza-since-October-2023.pdf">their
report</a>, which reveal in stark detail the extent to which Israeli
forces have ravaged agricultural lands in Gaza. Alongside bombing,
shelling, and tank traffic, <a
href="https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20240707-bulldozed-and-shelled-gaza-s-farming-sector-ravaged-by-war">bulldozers</a>
have played an outsized role in the near-obliteration of that area’s
food production capacity. The model D-9 bulldozers that are used to
demolish Gaza’s buildings and lay waste to her farmland are manufactured
<a
href="https://allisrael.com/idf-bulldozers-play-central-role-in-military-operations-against-hamas-in-gaza">by
Caterpillar</a>, whose global headquarters is in Texas.</p>
<p>In the early months of the war, Biden administration officials also
took advantage of federal law, which doesn’t require that military aid
shipments whose dollar value falls below certain limits be reported.
They simply ordered that the huge quantities of arms then destined for
Israel be split up into ever smaller cargoes. And so it came to pass
that, during the first five months of the war, the Biden administration
delivered more than 100 loads of arms. In other words, on average during
that period, an American vessel <a
href="https://jacobin.com/2024/03/biden-weapons-israel-gaza-palestine">laden
with</a> “precision-guided munitions, small diameter bombs, bunker
busters, small arms and other lethal aid” was being unloaded at an
Israeli dock once every 36 hours.</p>
<p>Israeli pilots have used U.S.-built fighter jets for the lion’s share
of their airstrikes on Gaza and, by last summer, even more aircraft were
needed to sustain such levels of bombing. Of course, jets are too big
and expensive to be provided covertly, so, in August, Secretary of State
Blinken publicly approved the transfer of nearly $20 billion worth of <a
href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/blinken-approves-sale-israel-military-equipment-worth-over-20-bln-2024-08-13/">F-15
jets</a> and other equipment to the IDF. The aircraft account for most
of that sum, but the deal also includes hundreds of millions of dollars
worth of ground vehicles and tank and mortar ammunition.</p>
<p>In September, Bernie Sanders, who served in Congress alongside
Patrick Leahy from 2007 until the latter’s retirement in 2023, further
enhanced the good reputation of Vermont senators by introducing three
resolutions that would have blocked the State Department’s $20 billion
Israel aid package. But when the measures came up for a vote in
November, all Republicans, along with <a
href="https://www.newsweek.com/sanders-resolution-block-arms-sale-israel-struck-down-1989047">two-thirds</a>
of Democrats, joined forces to vote them down. So, as always, Israel
will continue to get its jets, tanks, and ammo.</p>
<p>With scant political opposition, the new Republican-controlled
Congress and Trump White House will undoubtedly only double down on
material support for Israel’s war crimes. And they are already
threatening people who demonstrate publicly in support of an arms
embargo with investigation, prosecution, deportation, or other kinds of
attacks. Citing those and other threats, Ben Samuels of <em>Haaretz</em>
<a
href="https://portside.org/2024-12-26/how-trump-and-gop-plan-dismantle-us-pro-palestinian-movement">anticipates</a>
that Trump’s promise “to crack down on pro-Palestinian sentiment in
America will be a defining factor of his administration’s early days”
and that “the fight against the pro-Palestinian movement might be one of
the only things that has a clear path across the government” — that is,
the suppression could be bipartisan. For the people of Gaza and their
American supporters, 2025 could turn out to be even more horrifying than
the ghastly year just passed.</p>
