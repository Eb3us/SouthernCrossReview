<h3>Building a Movement for Social Justice in a Time of Peril</h3>
<h2>By <a href="https://tomdispatch.com/authors/liztheoharis/">Liz Theoharis</a> and <a href="https://tomdispatch.com/authors/williamhartung/">William D. Hartung</a></h2>

<main>
<p class="intro">With the return of Donald Trump to the White House, advocates for
peace, social justice, racial and economic equality, fair immigration
policies, climate renewal, trans rights, and other movements for change
are bracing for hard times. The new administration will be doggedly
opposed to so many of the values we hold dear, as well as programs that
have helped keep millions of Americans above the poverty line.</p>
<p>Only recently, newly reelected Speaker of the House Mike Johnson
reaffirmed his commitment to an “<a
href="https://mikejohnson.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=1514">America
First”</a> agenda, which distills the most harmful aspirations of the
Heritage Foundation’s <a href="https://www.project2025.org/">Project
2025</a> into 10 priority areas, including slashing social welfare,
healthcare programs, and public education; supporting increased military
spending to promote”peace through strength”; unleashing a nightmarish
version of immigration enforcement; and restricting voting rights.</p>
<p>Many of us are now asking ourselves, how did we end up here? Part of
the answer is simple enough: the status quo, regardless of which party
has been in power, simply hasn’t been working for all too many
Americans. Research compiled by our colleague Shailly Gupta Barnes of
the Kairos Center indicates that some <a
href="https://kairoscenter.org/kairos-center-policy-briefing-11-the-140-million-is-a-theory-of-change/">140
million of us</a> live either in poverty or one financial emergency away
from joining the ranks of the poor. One out of six children in this
country now lives below the official poverty line and the families of <a
href="https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/news/nearly-half-american-children-living-near-poverty-line">nearly
half</a> of all kids are in a state of economic precarity or food
insecurity. Meanwhile, the average life span of white American males is
actually <a
href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/how-to-live-longer-for-men-2223908">declining</a>,
while more than <a
href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/12/politics/medicaid-coverage-health-insurance/index.html">20
million</a> people lost their access to health care in 2024 alone.</p>
<p>All of this is, of course, a far cry from the conventional wisdom
that America’s economy is doing well, based on statistics like the
unemployment rate or the rate of economic growth as a whole, none of
which capture the lived experience of so many of us. Indeed, the head of
Moody’s Analytics recently told the <a
href="https://www.ft.com/content/c755a34d-eb97-40d1-b780-ae2e2f0e7ad9"><em>Financial
Times</em></a> that, while “high-income households are doing fine, the
bottom third of U.S. consumers are tapped out.”</p>
<p>Although the system isn’t working for millions of Americans, a
business-as-usual, market-based approach remains what’s on offer in
official Washington. This has been the governing modus operandi across
party lines for the past 30 years and continues to enjoy bipartisan
support, even as faith in government declines in the country as a whole.
Without a viable plan that could change the basic living conditions of
people in need, it’s easier for right-wing populists to offer false
promises of change or, even worse, provide scapegoats like undocumented
immigrants to “explain” declining living standards and the outright
desperation so many people now feel.</p>
<p>Of course, this propaganda is fueled by countless millions of dollars
contributed by <a
href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/who-are-mega-rich-donors-backing-trump-2024-04-26/">rich
donors</a>, often enough billionaires, who, for starters, want more tax
cuts, more deregulation of business, unfettered access to <a
href="https://campaignlegal.org/update/musk-and-ramaswamy-stand-gain-even-more-wealth-serving-trumps-administration">government
contracts</a>, and free rein for <a
href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/what-does-a-trump-administration-mean-for-crypto">cryptocurrency</a>.
It’s reinforced by proponents of religious nationalism who organize
around single issues like opposition to <a
href="https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-christian-nationalism-abortion-ban-b2629614.html">abortion</a>,
while falsely portraying moves towards racial and gender equality as “<a
href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/23326492231160530">threats</a>”
to Christian values. Over the past several years, such interests have
combined forces to usher Donald Trump back into the White House and
dozens of “Christian nationalists” into the judicial and legislative
branches of government, including <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/01/opinion/mike-johnson-christian-nationalism-speaker.html">Speaker
of the House</a> Mike Johnson.</p>
<a target="_blank" href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/you-only-get-what-you-re-organized-to-take-lessons-from-the-movement-to-end-poverty-liz-theoharis/21634785?ean=9780807008645"><div class="polaroid"><img class="b" src="theoharis_book_cover.png" alt="You Only Get What Your're Organized to Take by Theoharis" style="width:100%"><div class="container"><p>Buy the Book!</p></div></div></a>
<p>Contrary to <a
href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-return-power-fueled-by-hispanic-working-class-voter-support-2024-11-06/">mainstream
accounts</a> that put the responsibility for Trump’s rise and then
return to power on working-class voters (some of whom did indeed press
the lever for him), the real victors in the November elections were the
wealthy and powerful, many of whom used their public profiles and deep
pockets to help propel the Trump-Vance ticket to victory. They and their
corporations are now ready to receive ample <a
href="https://campaignlegal.org/update/musk-and-ramaswamy-stand-gain-even-more-wealth-serving-trumps-administration">government
contracts</a> and benefit from the erasure of corporate regulations.
Meanwhile, religious extremists will welcome further encroachment on
reproductive and LGBTQ rights.</p>
<p>Case in point: on the day that Donald Trump was pronounced victorious
in the 2024 election, the eight richest men in the world were instantly
worth another <a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/nov/07/trump-victory-adds-record-wealth-richest-top-10">$64
billion</a>. Nevertheless, much of the analysis surrounding the 2024
elections continues to emphasize the notion that <a
href="https://www.weekendreading.net/p/how-trump-won">Trump’s
victory</a> was primarily due to decisions made by the working class and
the poorest Americans.</p>
<p>So, what is to be done? This is no time to blame those who are going
to be hurt by Trump’s draconian policies, nor is it a moment to get in a
defensive crouch to fight off only the worst policies in the making
without also putting forth a vision of the world we’d actually like to
see, a world where people’s needs are met with real programs, not
diversionary rhetoric and false promises.</p>
<p><strong>Promoting a Government That Works for All</strong></p>
<p>While people like billionaire Elon Musk are busy hatching schemes to
<a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/16/us/politics/dept-government-efficiency-explainer.html">dismantle
large parts</a> of the federal government, we need to push for an agenda
in which the government actually works for everyone. Shifting federal
budget priorities toward improving lives and away from war spending and
tax breaks for the rich would be a central element of such a program.
Pouring resources — <a
href="https://tomdispatch.com/fueling-the-warfare-state/">more than a
trillion dollars</a> a year — into the war machine and the national
security state starves other priorities, ranging from public health to
environmental protection. In fact, defunding such programs, an essential
part of Trump’s second-term plans, risks another pandemic or the “<a
href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/public-health-experts-warning-quad-212352378.html">quad-demic</a>”
that health officials have been warning about, as well as increased
hunger, untreated medical conditions, and dirtier air and water. The
problems to come won’t just involve an imbalance on a spreadsheet. There
are all too many <a
href="https://news.ucr.edu/articles/2023/04/17/poverty-4th-greatest-cause-us-deaths">lives
at stake</a>, as surely as lives are at stake in a shooting war.</p>
<p>Imagine how starkly different this country would be if we were to
invest in the lives of people rather than filling the coffers of the
military-industrial complex. Take the expanded (and fully refundable) <a
href="https://povertycenter.columbia.edu/publication/2021-child-poverty-reduction">child
tax credit</a>, or CTC. Created in March 2021 through the American
Rescue Plan, this federal policy granted modest monthly cash payments to
families with children, including poor families, independent of their
work or tax status. Families making less than $150,000 received regular
cash infusions they could use to pay daily expenses or shore up slim to
nonexistent savings.</p>
<p>The results were staggering. By <a
href="https://povertycenter.columbia.edu/publication/montly-poverty-december-2021">December
2021</a>, that program had reached more than 61 million children, nearly
four million of whom had been lifted above the official poverty line. In
its first and only year, official child poverty witnessed a <a
href="https://povertycenter.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/content/Publications/Child-Tax-Credit-Research-Roundup-One-Year-On-CPSP-2022.pdf">dramatic
decline</a>, the single largest drop in American history, including a
25% decrease in poverty among Black children, narrowing the overall
racial gap among poor kids. At the time, Moody’s <a
href="https://www.moodysanalytics.com/-/media/article/2021/economic-assessment-of-bIden-fiscal-rescue-package.pdf?ftag=MSF0951a18">estimated</a>
that the impact of the CTC on the economy was comparable to, if not
greater than, the jobs created through military spending.</p>
<p>Despite its success, the expanded CTC was abandoned as 2021 ended.
Two Democrats and 49 Republicans voted to end it, with West Virginia
Democratic Senator Joe Manchin <a
href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/manchin-privately-raised-concerns-parents-would-use-child-tax-credit-n1286321">claiming</a>
that poor families might be using the money to buy drugs. The CTC, of
course, hadn’t failed. The failure was that of an <a
href="https://changewire.org/too-hungry-to-take-part-in-democracy/">impoverished
democracy</a>, increasingly captive to the interests of the rich and
powerful and willing to leave nearly half the population living hand to
mouth, despite proven policies that could help lift the load of
poverty.</p>
<p>And consider that the real danger of the second Trump administration,
which has already appointed a <a
href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/trump-tapped-unprecedented-13-billionaires-top-administration-roles/story?id=116872968">record
13 billionaires</a> to government posts, is its debt to the enormously
wealthy at the expense of the rest of us. You need look no further than
Trump’s cozy relationship with <a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/sep/07/elon-musk-first-trillionaire-2027">future
trillionaire</a> Elon Musk. As co-head of the new Department of
Government Efficiency, or DOGE, with business interests in the very
institutions he’ll have some authority over, Musk will also, it seems,
have an undue influence on future federal budgets, priorities, and
programs. Indeed, DOGE co-chairs Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy have already
<a
href="https://gfmag.com/economics-policy-regulation/department-of-government-efficiency-doge-massive-cuts/">set
their sights</a> on shutting down the Department of Education and
cutting about one-third of the federal government’s annual budget, or $2
trillion.</p>
<p>We’re preparing for this and more in the coming weeks and months, but
it doesn’t need to be this way.</p>
<p><strong>What Is to Be Done?</strong></p>
<p>In 1968, as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., was organizing against the
triple evils of racism, militarism, and poverty in what would be the
last crusade of his life, <a
href="https://kairoscenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/King-quotes-PPC-Dec-2016-2.pdf">he
said</a>, “Power for poor people will really mean having the ability,
the togetherness, the assertiveness, and the aggressiveness to make the
power structure of this nation say yes when they may be desirous to say
no.” His <a
href="https://www.civilrightsmuseum.org/50-voices-for-50-years/posts/poverty-racism-and-the-legacy-of-kings-poor-peoples-campaign">theory
of change</a> was to turn those most adversely impacted by poverty into
a political force powerful enough not to be denied, even by the greatest
economic and military power in the world.</p>
<p>Under the second Trump administration, there will be a torrent of
emergencies to deal with, including threats of <a
href="https://immigrantjustice.org/know-your-rights/mass-deportation-threats">mass
deportation</a>, the shredding of the <a
href="https://www.npr.org/2024/11/25/nx-s1-5184462/the-countrys-social-safety-net-could-be-in-danger-as-trump-looks-to-slash-spending">social
safety net</a>, and attacks on efforts to promote racial and economic
justice and gender equality. Some of this will be new to us, including
potentially massive immigration raids on schools and churches, while
much of it has already been unfolding at a state level. For example, <a
href="https://translegislation.com/">in 2024 alone</a>, more than 650
bills were introduced nationwide to restrict the rights of trans people.
Because such bills were massively unpopular, well over 600 of them
failed. This may change, however, if they’re taken up at the federal
level in 2025.</p>
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1568586973/ref=nosim/?tag=tomdispatch-20"><div class="polaroid"><img class="b" src="theoharis_book_cover_2.png" alt="Prophets Of War by William D. Hartung" style="width:100%"><div class="container"><p>Buy the Book!</p></div></div></a>
<p>As people of conscience fight back against such assaults, we should
connect that resistance to calls for a government that reflects our
deepest values and commitments to justice. To fight for such a future
means making demands that are far beyond what’s politically possible
now. Simply resisting what Donald Trump’s government tries to do won’t
be enough. We need to build public support for a robust, carefully
crafted plan for public investment that will be a viable stepping-stone
toward a more equitable, peaceful, and just world.</p>
<p>During the first Trump administration, the Poor People’s Campaign: A
National Call for Moral Revival produced an ambitious social and
economic agenda, “<a
href="https://www.poorpeoplescampaign.org/resource/poor-peoples-moral-budget/">The
Poor People’s Moral Budget: Everybody’s Got a Right to Live</a>.” It
called for the right to living-wage jobs, affordable housing, debt
cancellation, strong anti-poverty programs, guaranteed adequate income,
and much more. It made clear that, through far fairer taxation and the
shifting of funds from bloated military budgets to programs of social
uplift, it would be possible to “lift from the bottom” in America.</p>
<p>Imagine a country where everyone could exist free of the fear of
poverty, hunger, homelessness, or lack of access to quality health care.
Of course, trying to shift this country’s priorities in such a way would
pose a major political challenge, but social and political organizations
and movements have succeeded in the past, even in the darkest of times.
The organizing of the Citizen’s Army during the <a
href="https://wvminewars.org/what-were-the-mine-wars">Mine Wars</a> in
West Virginia early in the last century and the birth of the labor union
movement successfully pressured both corporations and the government for
better wages and working conditions that workers still benefit from
today. In the midst of the Great Depression of the 1930s, military
veterans in the <a
href="https://prologue.blogs.archives.gov/2020/07/15/the-1932-bonus-army-black-and-white-americans-unite-in-march-on-washington/">Bonus
Army Encampment</a> in Washington, D.C., demanded that the government
pay those promised “bonuses” and won. The Black Panther Party’s <a
href="https://www.history.com/news/free-school-breakfast-black-panther-party">Free
Breakfast Programs</a> fed more children in the late 1960s than any
other institutional entity. It paved the way for free breakfast and
lunch programs in public schools across the country, while calling out
the failures of the government to provide life, liberty, and the pursuit
of happiness for all people. During those same years, <a
href="https://economicsecurityproject.org/news/the-national-welfare-rights-organization-wanted-economic-justice-for-black-americans￼/">welfare
rights</a> leaders formed the largest poor people’s organization of the
time and secured essential benefits for tens of thousands of people,
while more than doubling the amount of federal support flowing to the
poorest Americans.</p>
<p>Because they did it then, we can do it now.</p>
<p>This is not to suggest that shifting funds from the Pentagon to
domestic programs is a magic solution to America’s economic problems.
Even cutting the Pentagon budget in half would not be enough to meet all
this country’s unmet needs. That would require a comprehensive package,
involving a major shift in budget priorities, an increase in federal
revenues, and a crackdown on waste, fraud, and abuse in the expenditure
of government loans and grants. It would, in fact, require the kind of
attention and focus now reserved for war planning.</p>
<p>Imagine a real war on poverty, not the <a
href="https://www.crmvet.org/docs/mlkviet2.htm#:~:text=We%20have%20escalated%20the%20war,and%20adequate%20anti%2Dpoverty%20programs.">“skirmish”</a>
(as Dr. King called it) of the 1960s, President Lyndon Johnson’s effort
that would be cut short by the war in Vietnam. What’s needed is a
coordinated series of campaigns that could change the conditions that
produce poverty for good.</p>
<p>Now, let’s be real: 2025 is going to be a truly hard year for the
poor and vulnerable in our society. But the promise and possibility of
ending poverty, reclaiming democracy, and advancing peace and justice
remain closer than any of us may think. What’s needed is to begin to
build something better, with, as Dr. King suggested, “the ability, the
togetherness, the assertiveness, and the aggressiveness” to make it
so.</p>
