<p class="intro">The first Waldorf school was founded in 1919 in Germany by one of
Rudolf Steiner’s followers, Emil Molt, who was the owner and director of
the Waldorf Astoria cigarette factory. It was meant at first for the
children of Molt’s employees and was based on Steiner’s educational
ideas. Also, because Molt wanted to put into practice Steiner’s social
ideas, namely the “Threefold Society” or the triformation of the social
organism.</p>
<p>I first became aware of this back in the 1970s when I became involved
in a Waldorf School my daughter attended in Argentina. In 1919 Rudolf
Steiner published a book: <a
href="https://wn.rudolfsteinerelib.org/Books/GA023/German/GA023_index.html"><em>Die
Kernpunkte der sozialen</em></a> <a
href="https://wn.rudolfsteinerelib.org/Books/GA023/German/GA023_index.html"><em>Frage</em></a>
(<a
href="https://wn.rudolfsteinerelib.org/Books/GA023/English/SCR2001/GA023_index.html"><em>Basic
Issues of the Social Question</em></a>.) Later when I lived in
Switzerland, I translated it. It was published in the U.K as <em>Toward
Social Renewal</em>. The latest edition is titled <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Toward-Threefold-Society-Issues-Question/dp/1948302195">Toward
a Threefold Society</a> published in the United States by
AnthroposophicalPublications.org.</p>
<p>It is not an easy book, but it surprised me to realize that the same
individual, whose work was the foundation of Waldorf pedagogy and who
had spoken and written about angels, devils, religion, reincarnation and
karma, had also introduced concepts about how society should be
organized and renewed in a rational, practical way.</p>
<p>Basically, he said that society consists of three elements: the
rights state (politics), the economy (production, distribution and
consumption of goods) and the cultural or spiritual (everything else,
especially education). The defining characteristic of the political
state is equality; the defining characteristic of the economy is
fraternity; and the defining characteristic of the spiritual-cultural
sector is freedom. The problem is that each of the three sections should
be autonomous — or at least semi-autonomous — whereas they are combined
and confused. For example, the political state controls education which
should be a factor of a <em>free </em>cultural section of society. The
economy should not be controlled by the State nor by the “free” market,
which doesn’t exist. Rather it should be determined by associations of
producers, distributors <em>and </em>consumers.</p>
<p>The last paragraph in the book especially interested me:</p>
<p>“<em>One can anticipate the experts who object to the complexity of
these suggestions and find it uncomfortable even to think about three
systems cooperating with each other, because they wish to know nothing
of the real requirements of life and would structure everything
according to the comfortable requirements of their thinking. This must
become clear to them: either people will accommodate their thinking to
the requirements of reality, or they will have learned nothing from the
calamity and will cause innumerable new ones to occur in the
future.</em>”</p>
<p>The calamity referred to is the First World War, and since that time
history has certainly shown these words to be prophetic. I am writing
this in 2024 and since first reading the book in 1970 I have witnessed
many and more terrible calamities, and the future looks bleak
indeed.</p>
<p>A few days ago a young man named Luigi Mangione shot and killed the
CEO of an American health care insurer on a street in Manhattan in broad
daylight. Why am I not only shocked, but also sympathize to a certain
extent with Luigi – if that is possible when the crime is murder. And I
am not alone. He has become a modern Jessie James, a criminal good guy
whose action was to help the average suckers who suffer under the brutal
American capitalist so called “health care” system. The insurers work
not for their clients’ health, but to make as much money as possible for
themselves and their stockholders. Paid for by the insured. And they are
very successful at making money. The victim CEO earned ten million
dollars that year.</p>
<p>In 1919, when Steiner’s book was written, the Soviet Union was still
in formation — a political-economic-cultural dictatorship. Then came the
Second World War, more terrible by far than the First, and the
holocaust. But the wars (cold and hot) never ended: Korea, Vietnam, etc.
And even now as I write in 2024 the Middle East is about to explode in
Israel’s face and Russia and Ukraine are fighting to the end. The
calamities have been occurring ‘innumerably’ ever since. The ‘social
question’ has never been answered in practice.</p>
<p>The world’s economy is not healthy; in fact, it has been ill at least
since the industrial revolution, basically the transition from creating
goods by hand to using machines. It began about 1760 and developed
quickly, both positively and negatively. It began in Great Britain and
soon spread around the world. Before that period, most households made
their living farming and lived primarily in small, rural communities.
With the advent of factories and more efficient production, people began
working for companies located in urban areas for the first time. Often
the wages were low, and conditions were extremely harsh. The increase in
the number of factories and migration to the cities led to pollution,
deplorable working and living conditions, and child labor. It was also
responsible for creating capitalism.</p>
<p>The purest form of capitalism is free-market capitalism. Here,
private individuals and corporations are unrestrained. They may
determine where to invest, what to produce or sell, and at which prices
to charge for goods and services without checks or controls. In reality
there is no such thing as a “free market”. A market is a situation which
may be freely used or restricted. The free marketeers call their
offspring a call to freedom, not only for them, but also for the
consumers who – according to them – are free to buy or not. The
capitalist was and is also free to buy human labor, not the whole human
being as in slavery, but the essential part of him: his work.</p>
<p>There were even economic philosophers, such as my namesake Adam
Smith, who recognized that the capitalist was greedy, but that greed is
good in the sense that as the capitalist earns ever more, everyone –
including the worker – benefits (“it trickles down”). But it doesn’t
work that way. The capitalists kept and keep their earnings for
themselves and become ever richer, while the workers earn a small
trickle indeed, in some cases barely enough to survive.</p>
<p>Along came Karl Marx, a German philosopher who had to leave Germany,
where his ideas and writings were unacceptable, to the freedom of
expression still available in England. There he wrote his magnum opus
“Das Kapital”, which saw the working class as historically and
inevitably inheriting the power then in the hands of the capitalist
bourgeoisie.</p>
<p>His books were far beyond the intellectual capacity of most members
of the working class, but were convincing for better educated social
activists. Marx contended that there would be a revolt of the urban
industrial workers, who would eventually be the new rulers. Eventually,
or more likely in the distant future, in the proletarian (workers)
state, all would be equal economically as well as spiritually, to the
extent that the state would no longer be necessary and a
materialistically moral anarchy would result. But it had to be helped
along, so Marx and his patron Friedrich Engels published a powerful
message: <em>The Communist Manifesto, </em>which cried out: “Workers of
the world unite, you have nothing to lose, but your chains!”</p>
<p>During the 1850s Marx was struggling economically in London, but he
and his large family (four children) survived with help from Engels and
by writing articles for the New York Daily Tribune. Surprised? Marx
continued to write articles for that newspaper until in late 1861 there
was a change in editorial policy. No longer was the <em>Tribune</em> to
be a strong abolitionist newspaper. The new editorial board supported an
immediate peace in the Civil War in the United States with slavery left
intact in the Confederacy. Marx strongly disagreed with this new
political position and in 1863 was forced to withdraw as a writer for
the <em>Tribune</em>.</p>
<p>Marx’s Russian followers, Lenin and Trotsky, attempted to put into
practice his concept that the economy – production, distribution, even
consumption – be controlled by the state: the Soviet Union. Not long
after the communist revolution the Soviet Union became a brutal
dictatorship, worse than what they hoped to displace.</p>
<p>After Nazi Germany’s defeat in World War II, the Soviet Union under
Stalin took control of a large chunk of Europe and engaged in a cold war
with the United States and the United Kingdom. The Soviet Union
collapsed of its own weight in 1990 and eventually became Russia again,
as capitalist as the rest and a dictatorship to boot. And we’re back to
where we started from.</p>
<p>In the west there has been much talk about the Russian “oligarchs”.
But what about the American oligarchs, who are so enormously rich that
they exceed the Russians’ wealth by far. In fact, capitalist oligarchs
control a world in which the majority of the planet’s population are
miserably poor.</p>
<p><strong>The associative economy</strong></p>
<p>The political state should not control or enact economic activity,
but unlike communism, which gives absolute power – economic, political
and cultural – to the state, the Threefold Society assigns the economy
to “associations” consisting of representatives of producers,
distributors and consumers, the three players in every or most business
transactions. Accordingly, representatives of these three should make
all the economic decisions: prices, quality, profit margin, etc.</p>
<p>Let’s take an industry that I know --or knew something about when I
was active in the international airline industry. I worked for American
Airlines as a ticketing, check-in and passenger service agent at La
Guardia Airport in New York City for about three years, from 1959 until
1962; then for the International Air Transport Association (IATA) as a
Tariff Integrity and Fraud Prevention manager in Buenos Aires, Zurich,
Frankfurt, Geneva and back to Buenos Aires. Until retirement.</p>
<p>At that time all the international airlines met regularly at IATA’s
head office in Geneva to discuss fares aka tariffs – passenger and
freight – as well as flight conditions, and much more. This was of
course monopolistic behavior and would have been illegal if governments
hadn’t given airlines exemption from anti-monopoly laws when acting
within the embracing arms of the International Air Transport
Association. The argument IATA used to obtain this exemption was that
the airlines needed to be able to charge fares high enough to ensure
safety. This was in 1944, when IATA was founded in Havana, Cuba, of all
places, and when bumpy commercial air travel was still considered
risky.</p>
<p>It lasted a long time. Around 1980 the U.S. government decided that
such monopolistic activity was harmful for consumers’ (passengers, aka
voters) interests, so it withdrew the exemption of U.S. carriers
(PanAmerican, United, Eastern, etc.). So U.S. airlines could no longer
participate in IATA’s fares negotiations.</p>
<p>The European and Asian airlines continued setting fares thus giving
the U.S. government the cold shoulder. But in the era of the American
Empire, this was not a good idea. They were able to hold out a while,
until the U.S. government decreed that foreign airlines could not even
sell tickets in the U.S. involving travel to or from the U.S. using the
fares which had been determined within IATA. That was the end of IATA´s
“traffic conference” fare setting. Although there had been no
competition involving one-way fares, there was plenty of competition in
quality, frequency, passenger service, group and triangular fares
etc.</p>
<p>The consequence was the reverse of what the government promised. Many
airlines went bankrupt, such as PanAm, Eastern, TWA and some of the
best: Swissair and Varig (Brazil). Just as Marx prophesied, the big guys
swallowed the little guys; and there are far fewer international
airlines operating now than before “open skies”, even when it doesn’t
appear so: Iberia is now a vassal of British Airways, KLM belongs to Air
France, and so on. Passengers have “benefited” by miserable, arrogant
service, higher fares – including all the add-ons – and crowded
aircraft.</p>
<p>About a year before the U.S. government lowered the boom, I wrote an
article for a magazine called <em>INTERAVIA World Review of Aviation –
Astronautics – Avionics; </em>it was widely read by people active in the
air transport industry. The article’s title is “The Associative
Principle – its application in the air transport industry”.</p>
<p>Basically, I proposed that the airlines invite representatives of
passengers and travel agents to their traffic conferences, where fares
and other travel conditions were decided. I had already heard rumors
that the U.S. government was considering prohibiting the American
airlines from participating in said traffic conferences. Although it was
only the U.S. airlines at the beginning, it would surely spread. But if
passenger representatives were also participating in the decision-making
process, and therefore defending their own interests, there would no
longer be a rationale for prohibition.</p>
<p>However, according to my conditions of employment with IATA, I had to
submit anything I might publish having to do with the air transport
industry to Geneva for the Director General’s permission. This was not
arbitrary, for if an article such as this one shows the author as
belonging to management of IATA, it would seem as if the airlines that
were members agreed with it – which they decidedly did not. In fact, I
asked the representative of Swissair what he thought of the idea: he
said that the airline reps had enough difficulty agreeing among
themselves, while having passenger reps participating would make
agreement that much more difficult, if not impossible. This was also the
viewpoint of a comment that appeared in the same issue as my article. It
was quite long and argued strongly against the idea, which seems
attractive at first glance, but... It was signed by Klaus H. Regelin,
Publisher and Managing Director of the magazine.</p>
<p>I will only mention that the Director General of IATA at that time
was Knut Hammarskjold, nephew of Dag Hammarskjold. (If you don´t know
who Dag H. was, ask Google.) He liked the article, but his employers –
the world’s international airlines – would have had a collective fit if
they knew who wrote it. So he allowed me to have the article published
in <em>Interavia</em> , but not under my own name. The article’s author
appeared as “Francis Tate”.</p>
<p>In seems obvious that the producer-capitalists of all or of most
industries would not willingly accept their consumer-customers
participating in price and quality decisions. There have been airline
passenger groups over the years, one of the latest being <a
href="https://flyersrights.org/"></a> , who would gladly participate.
However, if the producers refuse to participate, the solution would
necessarily be a law (determined by the democratic state) establishing
associative economic groups for the various industries to guarantee
consumers rights.</p>
<p>If you think that it is overly idealistic to imagine that such
associative economic groups would ever come into existence, or even more
unlikely a “threefold society” based upon liberty, equality and
fraternity, you may well be right, but I will take the liberty of
repeating Rudolf Steiner’s words from over a century ago:</p>
<p>“<em>One can anticipate the experts who object to the complexity of
these suggestions and find it uncomfortable even to think about three
systems cooperating with each other, because they wish to know nothing
of the real requirements of life and would structure everything
according to the comfortable requirements of their thinking. This must
become clear to them: either people will accommodate their thinking to
the requirements of reality, or they will have learned nothing from the
calamity and will cause innumerable new ones to occur in the
future.</em>”</p>
