# The Fifth Gospel

## by Rudolf Steiner

### Introduction

During the years 1913 and 1914 Rudolf Steiner gave lectures on The Fifth
Gospel in various cities, beginning in Oslo, Norway, where the first
five basic lectures were given. He then traveled to various German
cities to repeat what he considered the most important and difficult
task of his career. The lectures were only for the members of the
Anthroposophical Society's branches. They were to be received
respectfully and discreetly, for such esoteric revelations, especially
those concerning the two Jesus children, would not only not be
understood by the public, but would also be condemned by the official
Roman Catholic and Lutheran churches. The last two lectures, in Cologne,
bore the title "The Mystery of Golgotha".

Shortly before her death in 1948 Marie Steiner decided to publish the
first five Oslo lectures in her own publishing company. She felt that
the time was ripe and necessary for a wider range of people to have
access to them. Of the eighteen lectures given in 1913 and 1914, only
translations of the first five in Oslo and the last two in Cologne are
offered here. This is because the rest contain what is covered in these
seven lectures -- the beginning and the end, so to speak -- and to avoid
much repetition.

### Lecture One

Oslo, Norway, October 1, 1913

**The theme** I intend to speak about seems to me to be especially
important in view of the times and conditions in which we live. I would
like to emphasize from the start that it is not due to a wish for
sensationalism or similar things that the theme is *The Fifth Gospel*.
For I hope to show that, in fact, given our present circumstances no
other name is more appropriate. This Fifth Gospel, as you will hear it,
does not yet exist in a recorded document, although in the future it
will certainly exist in a specific record. But in a certain sense this
Fifth Gospel is as old as the other four Gospels.

In order that I may speak about this, however, an introduction is
necessary in order to clarify certain important points for a complete
understanding of what we will now call the Fifth Gospel. And I want to
start by saying that the time is not too far distant in which in the
basic school levels, in the most primitive instruction, the content of
the subject usually called "history" will be taught in a quite different
way than is the case today. Namely the concept of Christ will play a
different and a much more important role in the future of historical
considerations -- even in the most elementary historical considerations
-- than has been the case until now. I realize that in saying this I am
describing an enormous paradox. But let's just consider that we can go
back to a not so far distant time when countless hearts directed their
feelings to Christ in a much more intense way than is the case today.

If we study today's books and observe what interests contemporary
people, where their hearts are, we have the impression that the
enthusiasm and feelings for the Christ idea is in abatement, especially
where claims of contemporary learning are involved. Nevertheless, as I
have already emphasized, the Christ idea will play a much more important
role in future historical considerations than has been the case until
now. Does this seem to be a contradiction?

Let's then approach the other side of these thoughts. I have often
spoken here in this city about the meaning of the Christ concept. And in
books and lecture cycles we find diverse elaborations from spiritual
science about the secrets of the Christ Being and the Christ concept.
Therefore one must come to the conclusion that a large amount of
knowledge is required for a full understanding of the Christ Being; that
one must depend on the profoundest concepts and ideas for a full
understanding of who Christ is and what the impulse is which has
traversed the centuries as the Christ-Impulse. One could even come to
the conclusion -- were it not otherwise contradicted -- that it is
necessary to know all of Anthroposophy in order to achieve a correct
understanding of Christ.

If we put that aside though, and look at spiritual development during
the past centuries, we see from century to century a detailed,
well-grounded science with the goal of understanding Christ and his
appearance on earth. For centuries people have utilized their highest,
most meaningful ideas in order to understand Christ. Here also it would
seem that only the most significant intellectual activity would be
sufficient to understand Christ. Has it been the case though? A very
simple consideration can prove that it has not.

Let us place on a spiritual balance all that has contributed until now
to the understanding of Christ by scholarship, science, even
Anthroposophy. Let us place all that on one scale of the spiritual
balance and let us place on the other scale all the deep feeling, all
the impulses in people's souls which have aimed at what we call Christ,
and we will find that all the science, all the scholarship, even all the
Anthroposophy which we can muster to explain Christ rises, and all the
deep feelings and impulses that have directed people to the Christ-Being
push the other scale far down. It is no exaggeration to say that a
tremendous impact has come from Christ and that the knowledge of Christ
has contributed least to this impact.

It would have gone most badly for Christianity if people had to depend
on all the learned disputes of the Middle Ages, the Scholastics, the
Church fathers; or if people were to depend only on what we are able to
gather through Anthroposophy for an understanding of the Christ concept.
If that were all, it would be very little indeed. I don't think that
anyone who has objectively followed the path of Christianity through the
centuries could seriously dispute this.

Let us direct our attention to the times when Christianity did not yet
exist. I need only to remind you of what most of you are familiar with.
I need only remind you of the Greek tragedies in ancient Greece,
especially in their older forms, when they presented the battling gods,
or the people in whose souls the battling gods acted; also how the
divine forces were directly visible on the stage. I need only to
indicate how Homer thoroughly weaved his poetry into the working of the
spirit; I have only to point to the great figures of Socrates, Plato,
and Aristotle. With these names a spiritual life of the highest order
appears before our minds. If we put all else aside and look only at the
great Aristotle, who lived centuries before the founding of
Christianity, we realize that in a certain sense no increase, no
advancement has taken place up to our time. Aristotle's thinking, his
scholarship, is so awesome that it is possible to say that he reached a
summit in human thinking which has not been improved upon since.

And now for a moment I would like to consider a curious hypothesis. Let
us imagine that there are no Gospels from which we can learn about
Christ. We want to imagine that the documents known as the New Testament
do not exist, that there are no Gospels. We will ignore what has been
said about the founding of Christianity and will only consider the facts
about Christianity's historical process in order to see what occurred
during the following centuries. This means that without the Gospels, the
Acts of the Apostles, the Pauline Letters and so forth, we will only
know what has actually happened. This is of course only a hypothesis.
What has happened?

If we look first at Southern Europe, we find a profound spiritual
development at a certain point in time, as we have just seen in its
representative, Aristotle -- a highly developed spiritual life, which in
the subsequent centuries went through a special schooling. Yes, at the
time Christianity began to make its way through the world there were
many people educated in the Greek way, people who had absorbed Greek
culture. Even including a certain unusual man who was an energetic
opponent of Christianity, *Celsus,* who later persecuted the Christians.
We find in the Italian sub-continent up to the second, third Christian
century, highly educated men who adopted the profound ideas which we
find in *Plato,* whose brilliance looked like a continuation of
Aristotle's brilliance, Romans with Greek culture, which added Greek
cultural delicacy to Roman aggressiveness.

The Christian impulse pushed itself into this world. At that time the
representatives of the Christian impulse were truly uneducated people in
respect to intellectualism, to knowledge of the world, compared to the
many Greek-Roman educated people. People without education pushed into
the middle of a world of mature intellect. And now we can observe a
strange scene: those simple, primitive natures who were the bearers of
early Christianity were able to propagate it in a relatively short time
in Southern Europe. And when we approach these simple, primitive souls
who at that time spread Christianity, we may say: Those primitive
natures did not understood the essence of Christ. The bearers of the
Christ impulse who entered into the arena of highly developed Greek
culture didn't understand it at all. They had nothing to bring to the
market of Greek-Roman life except their personal inwardness, which they
had developed as their personal relationship to their beloved Christ;
for they loved as a member of a beloved family just through this
relationship. Those who brought Christianity to Greece and Rome were not
educated theosophists; they were unlettered. The educated theosophists
of that time, the Gnostics, had elevated ideas about Christ, but they
could only give what we would have to place on the rising scale of the
weighing balance. If it had depended on the Gnostics, Christianity would
surely not have advanced through the world. It was no particularly
educated intellectualism which came from the east and in a relatively
short time brought ancient Greece and Rome to their knees. That's one
side of the story.

From the other side we see intellectually superior people such as
Celsus, Christianity's enemy, and even the philosopher on the throne,
Marcus Aurelius, who used every contrary argument imaginable. Look at
the immensely learned neo-platonists, who formulated ideas compared to
which contemporary philosophy is child's play, and which surpass our
current ideas in profundity and horizon. And look at how these highly
cultured people argued against Christianity, how they argued from the
standpoint of Greek philosophy, and we have the impression that none of
them understood the Christ-impulse. We see that Christianity was spread
by bearers who understood nothing of the essence of Christianity; it was
fought against by a high culture which could not understand what the
Christ-impulse meant. It is noteworthy that Christianity entered the
world in such a way that neither its adherents nor its enemies
understood its underlying spirit. Nevertheless, those people had the
strength in their souls to spread the Christ-impulse triumphantly
throughout the world.

Tertullian represented Christianity with a certain greatness. We see in
him a Roman who was, when we look at his language, almost a re-creator
of the Roman language, who with an unerring accuracy enlivened words to
the extent that we recognize him as an important personality. When we
ask ourselves, however, about Tertullian's ideas, it's something else.
We find that he showed very little intellect or high culture. Even
Christianity's defenders didn't accomplish much. Nevertheless, people
such as Tertullian were effective as personalities, for which reason
educated Greeks could not really do much. He was awe-inspiringly
effective through something. But what? That is the important thing. We
feel that this is really important. Through what did the bearers of the
Christ-impulse work when they themselves didn't understand much about
what the Christ-impulse is? Through what did the Christian Church
Fathers work, even Origenes, who was considered unskillful? What is it
that even Greek-Roman culture could not understand about the essence of
the Christ-impulse? What is it all about?

But let's go further. The phenomenon becomes more pronounced as we
consider subsequent history. We see how over the centuries Christianity
spread within Europe to peoples who, like the Germanic, derived from
completely different religious traditions and who were united as a
people, or at least seemed to be united in their religious traditions.
Nevertheless, they accepted the Christ-impulse with all their strength,
as though it were their own life. And when we consider the most
effective messengers of faith in the Germanic peoples -- were they the
scholastic theologically educated ones? By no means! They were
relatively primitive souls who went about among the people and in a
primitive way, using ordinary ideas speaking to the people and capturing
their hearts completely. They knew how to use words in such a way that
they touched the deepest heart-strings of their listeners. Simple people
went out to all regions, and it was they who worked most effectively.

So we see the spread of Christianity over the centuries. But then we
wonder at how this same Christianity is the grounds for so much
significant scholarship, science and philosophy. We don't underestimate
this philosophy, but today we want to direct our attention to an
extraordinary phenomenon -- that up until the Middle Ages Christianity
spread among peoples who had quite other ideas in their minds, until it
belonged to their souls. And in the not too distant future still other
things will be emphasized about the spread of Christianity. When we
consider the effect of the Christian impulse, it is easy to understand
that in a certain time enthusiasm arose through the spreading of
Christianity. But when we come to modern times this enthusiasm seems to
be muted.

Let us consider Copernicus and natural science up to the nineteenth
century. It could seem that this natural science, which since Copernicus
has penetrated western culture, was opposed to Christianity. Certain
facts can substantiate this. The Catholic Church, for example, placed
Copernicus on the so-called *Librorum Prohibitorum Index* until the
twenties of the nineteenth century. But that didn't change the fact that
Copernicus had been a canon. And when the Catholic Church burned
Giordano Bruno at the stake, it didn't change the fact that he was a
Dominican. Both of them came to their ideas through Christianity. They
acted from the Christian impulse. Those who held to the Catholic Church
and thought that these things weren't the fruits of Christianity, were
mistaken. It only proves that the Catholic Church did not understand the
fruits of Christianity.

Whoever looks more deeply will recognize that everything people did,
also in later centuries, is a result of Christianity; that through
Christianity humanity looked up from the earth to the vastness of the
heavens as a result of the Copernican Laws. That was only possible
within Christian culture and the Christian impulse. And he who does not
consider only the surface, but delves into the profundities of spiritual
life, will find something which seems paradoxical, but is nevertheless
true. For such a deeper consideration, it would seem impossible that a
Haeckel could appear in all his animosity towards Christianity without
his having appeared from out of Christianity. Ernst Haeckel is not even
possible without the prerequisite of Christian culture. And modern
natural scientific development, despite being so occupied with animosity
towards Christianity, is a child of Christianity, a direct continuation
of the Christian impulse.

Once the teething problems of natural science have been overcome,
humanity will realize what it means that the starting point of modern
natural science, logically followed, leads directly to spiritual
science, that there is a logical path from Haeckel to spiritual science.
When that is understood, it will be accepted that Haeckel had a
Christian mentality, even though he didn't realize it. Not only what is
called and has been called Christian has been brought forth by the
Christian impulse, but also what has agitated against Christianity has
been brought forth from the Christian impulse. One must not only
investigate things according to their concepts, but also according to
their reality in order to arrive at this knowledge. Darwin's Theory of
Evolution leads directly to the teaching of repeated earth lives, as you
can read in my book *Reincarnation and Karma*.

In order to stand on solid ground in relation to these things, one must
observe the force of the Christian impulse impartially. Whoever
understands Darwin and Haeckel and is familiar with what Haeckel did not
know (Darwin knew quite a lot), knows that the Darwinist movement is
only possible as a Christian movement. Understanding that, one comes
quite logically to the idea of reincarnation. And if he has the help of
a certain clairvoyance, he will arrive on this path quite logically to
the spiritual origin of the human race. It is of course a detour, but
when clairvoyance is added, it is a true path from Haeckel to the
spiritual origin of the earth.

But it is also possible that one takes Darwinism as it is presented
today, but without being conversant with the principles of life in
Darwinism itself; in other words, if you accept Darwinism as an impulse
and don't realize the profound understanding of Christianity which lies
in it, something very peculiar happens. What can happen is that you have
as little understanding of Christianity as you have of Darwinism. One
may then be abandoned by the good spirit of Christianity as well as by
the good spirit of Darwinism. If one is imbued with the good spirit of
Darwinism, however, then one can be ever so materialistic, and still be
led back to a point in the history of the earth where it becomes clear
that man never evolved from lower animal forms, that he must have had a
spiritual origin. One goes back to a point in time and sees man as a
spiritual being hovering over the earth. A logical Darwinism will lead
to that.

If on the other hand one is abandoned by the good spirit and goes back
in time as a strange believer in reincarnation; one can think that he
once lived as an ape during an incarnation. If one can believe that, it
means that he has been abandoned by the good spirits of both Darwinism
and Christianity and understands nothing of either. For logical
Darwinism could never lead one to believe that. This means that the
reincarnation idea must be quite openly transmitted to this
materialistic culture. It is certainly possible to divest Darwinism of
its Christianity. If not, however, one will find that the Darwinist
impulses were born of Christianity, and that the Christian impulses also
work where they are denied.

So we have not only the phenomenon that Christianity spread during the
first centuries irrespective of scholarship and the knowledge of its
followers and believers; that it spread during the Middle Ages with very
little help from the Scholastics; then we have the paradoxical
phenomenon that Christianity appeared as a kind of counterpart in
Darwinism. And the greatness of the idea in Darwinism derives its force
from Christian impulses. The Christian impulses which underlie it will
lead this science away from materialism.

There is something curious about the Christian impulses!
Intellectualism, knowledge and learning appear not to have been present
during the spreading of these impulses. One could say that Christianity
spread regardless of what people thought for or against it, so much so
that it seems to have found its antithesis in modern materialism. What
is it then which spreads? Not Christian ideas, not the science of
Christianity. One could still say that the moral feelings which are
planted through Christianity are spreading. One has only to observe
morality in these times and one will find much justification for the
anger of the representatives of Christianity against real or alleged
enemies of Christianity. Also the morals which could reign in the souls
of the less educated do not impress us much when we observe to what
extent they are Christian. What is it then which spreads? What is so
curious? What is it which marches through the world like a victorious
procession? What worked in the people who brought Christianity to the
Germanic, to the foreign world? What works in modern natural science,
where the teaching is still veiled? What works in all those souls, if it
isn't intellectual, not even moral impulses? What is it? It is Christ
himself who goes from heart to heart, soul to soul, who traverses the
world over the centuries whether or not people understand him!

We are obliged to put aside our ideas and our science and point to the
reality in order to show how mysteriously Christ himself changes into
many thousands of impulses, immersing in thousands and thousands of
souls and suffusing humanity. It is Christ himself who strode in the
simple men through the Greek and Italian world; it is Christ himself who
stood at the side of the later teachers who brought Christianity to the
Germanic peoples. It is He, the real, true Christ, who goes from place
to place, from soul to soul, regardless of what the people think of
Christ, and enters their souls. I would like to use a trivial
comparison. How many people are there who know nothing about the
composition of food, yet eat according to all the rules of the art. They
would starve if they had to know about nutrients before they could eat.
Eating has nothing to do with the knowledge of foodstuffs. The spread of
Christianity over the earth had nothing to do with the knowledge brought
to bear on it. That is what is curious. This is a mystery, which can
only be clarified if the answer is given to the question: How does
Christ work in human minds and feelings? And if spiritual science,
clairvoyant observation, poses this question, it will be guided to an
event which in reality can only be revealed through clairvoyant
observation, which is in complete agreement with all I have said today.
Firstly, the time is over in which Christ worked as I have
characterized, and the time has come when people must understand and
recognize him.

Therefore it is necessary to answer the question: Why during the time
which preceded ours, could the Christ-impulse spread without an
understanding of it? And the event to which clairvoyant consciousness
points is the so-called Pentecost event, the sending out of the Holy
Spirit. Therefore the clairvoyant gaze, inspired by the true
Christ-Impulse in an anthroposophical sense, is directed to the
Pentecost event, the sending out of the Holy Spirit.

What occurred at that moment in the evolution of the world on earth,
which is presented as the Holy Spirit descending upon the apostles,
which at first seems quite unintelligible to us? When one investigates
this clairvoyantly, one arrives at a spiritual scientific answer as to
what is meant by simple people, which the apostles were, suddenly
beginning to speak in various tongues about what they had to say from
the depths of the spirit, and which was not expected of them. Yes, then
Christianity began to spread independently of people's understanding.

The stream which has been described flowed out from the Pentecost event,
and the Fifth Gospel begins with the spiritual scientific answer to the
question: What was the Pentecost event?
