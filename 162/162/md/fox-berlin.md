# And the Wall Came Tumbling Down

![](fox-berlin.png){class="a"}

## By **Roberto Fox** (as told to **Frank Thomas Smith**)

He had the nerve to telephone and tell me to go to the American embassy.
Actually he asked, but it amounted to the same thing. It was November
1989 and I was sitting on my third-floor balcony overlooking the public
golf course in Belgrano Chico, Buenos Aires on a lovely afternoon. I
don't play golf. Call it ironic if you like, for any local golfer worth
his putter would have given his eye-teeth to live here. I was trying to
work on my new children's book and a brilliant idea had just penetrated
my writer's block when the phone rang inside. I jumped and almost
knocked over my portable typewriter but the only damage was a long line
of zzzzzs when my finger slipped down from the a-key and stuck on z. It
was the time of the month when my ex-wife often called from Germany to
complain that she hadn't received her alimony. It was hard to convince
her that it was the fault of the Argentine bureaucratic banking system,
that it would arrive, although late. I let it ring for the programed
seven times until the answering machine took over. I fully expected to
hear her exasperated whine, but nothing happened. No message, so it
wasn't her.

Now what was that brilliant idea I had before the telephone interrupted
it? Gone. I cursed and walked back and forth on the balcony, which was
only five paces, but that didn't help, so I went inside to the kitchen
for a beer, which was likely to help even less, but I was thirsty.
Spring had been short that year and it was already summery enough to
warrant a cold beer. I poured so it had a decent head of foam, which
isn't easy with the homegrown brew, not like the German stuff, and drank
it down before the foam dissolved completely. Then I stretched out on
the couch thinking that a short siesta might bring back the idea.

I had just dozed off when the damned phone rang again. I let it ring six
times then growled *Hola* into it, just to let whoever it was know that
yes, I was not in the mood for phone calls.

"Señor Roberto Fox?" a secretarial voice asked. When I concurred: "Un
momento, por favor."

"Hello, Roberto," a man said cheerfully in English. "This is Bob Knowles
from the U.S. embassy."

Do I know a Bob Knowles, I asked myself. "Do I know you?" I asked him.
"Not yet," he replied, "but-- "

"Then why are you calling me Roberto? If I don't know you, you don't
know me." That must have given him pause. Those arrogant twerps from the
embassy think that a call from them should make any American expat roll
over like a labrador and pant with joy.

Finally he recovered and said, "Sorry Mr Fox, I thought compatriots and
all, you know."

"What can I do for you Mr. Knowles?" I forbore from telling him to cut
the bullshit.

He got the message, but not all of it. "We'd like to talk to you about
an urgent matter," he said. "Can you come to the embassy?" I thought he
might be some vice-consul doing a favor for a colleague in Germany on
behalf of my ex-wife. She had a lot of contacts being the daughter of a
former ambassador.

"Okay, talk."

"What? Oh, no, not on the telephone." He lowered his voice dramatically.
"It's quite confidential, in fact." Well, that took care of the ex-wife
option. They wouldn't go to that extreme. But I didn't have a clue.

"Do you have my address?" I asked.

"Uh, yes, as a matter of fact I do. La Pampa 1290, apartment 3C" "So
make an appointment." Silence. "Are you in your office now?" I asked.

"Yes, I am," he said enthusiastically, probably thinking I'd changed my
mind.

"I'll call you back," I said. He screamed "Wait!" But I hung up. I
checked the Embassy's number in my address book. The usual machine
answered giving a long series of numbered options -- about visas,
passports, holidays, opening times, etc. Only the last one offered a
chance to speak to a human being: "Emergencies involving a U.S.
citizen". After about twenty rings a voice answered: "What's your
emergency, please?"

"With whom am I speaking?" That always puts bureaucrats who don't
identify themselves on the defensive. There was a longish pause, then
she said, "Miss Coughlan. What's you emergency, sir?"

"My name is Roberto Fox," I said, "and I need to talk to Bob Knowles --
urgently." "Just a moment, please." Then: "We don't have anyone by that
name here. Sorry." "But he just called me from the embassy." "Just a
moment please." I could hear voices, including hers, in the background,
but couldn't make out what they were saying, except someone saying
"Smith". She came back on the line. "Is that with a K?" "I suppose so,
as in knight of the round table." "Just a moment please."

"That's three moments and I'm still waiting." But she was already gone.

"Hello?" It was Bob. I had him figured now: CIA using a cover name for
no discernible reason.

"Hello, Bob. Roberto Fox here."

"Good, Mr Fox (with emphasis on the Mr.) Now you know I'm for real."
"Not quite. What's your real name -- Smith or Jones?" He didn't answer.
"Okay, if you want to talk to me you know where I live," I said." "When
would be convenient for you?" I didn't hear him sigh, but I could feel
it.

"Now. If not, next week." It occurred to me that some unknown auntie
might have left me a lot of money. Extremely unlikely, because I knew
all my aunts and none of them have any money to spare. But what do I
know?

"How about five-ish?"

"Come now, Bob, or forever hold your peace." "Okay, is half an hour
within the limits of your patience?" I'd made him eat humble pie, so now
he's getting ornery. "Now you're talkin'."

"Coffee or beer?" I asked him once he was seated comfortably on the
balcony. He looked at me as though I might poison his drink, whatever it
was. He was a chubby kid with rosy cheeks in a gray suit and a rosy tie.

"Beer," he chose. "By the way, my name is Jim Fullbright." "No wonder
you use a cover name. Any relation to the senator? "Second cousin."

"I won't hold it against you. Now what's this all about? By the way, you
can call me Roberto now that we know each other," I conceded while
pouring a beer sans foam." I even smiled.

He probably felt like telling me to fuck off, but only shrugged and
asked me if I knew Jesús Barragán.

That surprised me and I squinted as though trying to remember. Then I
said, "I used to know a guy with that name, yeah. Why do you ask?"

"Would you recognize him?" which was not exactly an answer.

"I guess so, though I haven't seen him in almost ten years." "Seven,"
Bob said, and smiled.

"Okay, seven," I agreed, resolving not to give any more information
without getting some in return.

"Were you friendly?" he asked.

"No, now tell me what you want or the interview is over." "We want you
to go to Berlin, Robert, and speak to our Chief of Station there." More
intrigued than surprised, I almost laughed. My daughter lives in Berlin
and I was thinking of visiting her. But since I quit IATA rather than
wait for retirement I wasn't eligible for free or reduced fare tickets.
Also I was too old -- or spoiled -- to go to the airport and hang around
as a standby for economy class when most flights were full anyway. I'd
been wondering if I could afford the trip if I had to pay -- something I
wasn't used to doing. Now this guy was offering to get me there for
nothing. "Berlin?" I said with a phony frown. "Why?" "I really don't
know, Roberto, but there's one more thing I have to ask you." He sounded
apologetic.

"Shoot."

You knew Barragán in connection with your work for the International Air
Transport Association, right?"

I nodded.

"What's your opinion of him?

"Conman." He nodded, took a small notebook from his pocket and wrote the
word.

> "It's one word," I said. "Can't you remember it? Now tell me why I
> should go to Berlin." "The Chief of Station there will tell you," Bob
> said, shaking his head. "I can't tell you what I don't know. What do
> you say? "First Class," is what I said.

"Business," he smiled. "No one goes First Class anymore." Actually, I
didn't expect anything else, but I looked disappointed. "And per diem of
course," he said.

"How much?"

"\$250 a day."

"Plus my fee of one five hundred dollars a day, of course." He shrugged.
"I'll have to check on that," he said, "but I suppose it can be
arranged." Shit, I should have asked for more.

Mike Huggin's office could easily have competed with the president of
Argentina's -- and win. As the CIA's Berlin Chief of Station he probably
considered himself more important than Argentina's president. I had been
brought directly from the airport in a Mercedes and was still
bleary-brained from the long flight, or I might not have accepted the
"op", as he called ir. Huggin was about sixty then, tall, thin, pale and
dapper, with a Clark Gable mustache. He looked to be in good shape for
his age and was certainly a handsome man. He possessed a charming smile
over capped teeth and a crunching handshake. He abandoned his desk to
greet me and we sat in leather-upholstered easy chairs.

"You look like you could use a cup of good coffee, Robert," he said. I
agreed. His secretary, an efficient looking middle aged ex-beauty, was
still standing in the doorway. He nodded to her and she disappeared, to
return five minutes later -- during which we discussed the weather in
Buenos Aires and Berlin -- with a tray of steaming coffee, milk and
fresh croissants. My mouth watered. He poured as the secretary left and
closed the door behind her.

"I understand you know Jesus Barragán, Robert -- or should I say
Roberto?" He pronounced Jesus as in English instead of the Spanish
"hey-soos"

"Take you pick,"I answered.

"Which is it -- I mean officially?"

"My Argentine passport says Roberto, my American one Robert. So they're
both official."

"You were born in Argentina, I understand." "That's right." I decided to
make him fish for the information, most of which he certainly had
anyway.

"And when did you become an American citizen?" "At birth. My father was
the manager of PanAm and he registered me at the consulate." "And your
mother?"

"German born, naturalized U.S. citizen."

"So that's how you learned German?"

I nodded. "I was also stationed in Gemany as an intelligence analst for
the U.S. Army -- which you most likely already know."

"Right." He walked to his desk, picked up a folder and opened it when he
returned to his seat.

"You know all this anyway, Mike," I said. I recognized his technique,
which I'd used myself when interrogating ("interviewing" we called it)
defectors to Berlin's American zone: People like to talk about
themselves, so warm them up by asking inconsequential stuff.

He smiled. "But I don't know when you moved from Argentina to the
States, to New York City."

"I was thirteen."

"You attended Brooklyn College and were in the R.O.T.C. -- but you quit.
Why was that, Robert?"

"Why did I quit the R.O.T.C.? Because I read *From Here to Eternity* and
decided I didn't want to be an officer."

He smiled. "Ever regret it?"

"Never," I said without smiling. "My military experience confirmed a
really good decision." He had probably been an officer, I figured.

"You also went to the Army Languge School to Study Russian. So you were
also a Russian linguist." I nodded

"Okay." He raised an eyebrow, which probably meant something to his
underlings, but not to me. "During your military service you were in the
7982^nd^ European Liaison Group." He closed the file. "What exactly did
you do in M.I., Robert?"

I sighed, visibly. "Picked up the mail, sent sources -- that's what we
called our bumbling spies -- into to East Zone, and interrogated
defectors."

"What were the sources looking for?"

"Numbers."

"Numbers?"

"Of Soviet vehicles, so we could decide whether they were where they
were supposed to be."

"Uh huh, any luck? "

"Well, we were never invaded."

"Thanks to you?"

"No thanks to me; it was a waste of time." "Okay." He didn't want to
hear why it was a waste of time. "What kind of people did you
interrogate?"

"Defectors from the GDR Volksarmee."

"Uh huh. Any Russians?"

"I never heard of a Russian defector -- military that is. All we did was
East German soldiers. You guys got the Russians, if there were any. That
was before the Wall, by the way, it must be harder now."

"Quite." He came back to the point. "How well do you know Barragán?"
"Not well at all. Met him a few times, that's all." "Elucidate, please."

"What's he got to do with Berlin and you guys?" I asked.

"Later. Now please tell me what you know of him." "I was Director of the
Fraud Prevention Division of IATA and he was our best customer."

"Customer?"

"Perpetrator. He kept the Division very busy. His specialty was sending
false PTAs -- Prepaid Ticket Advises -- to airlines." He frowned and I
knew I'd have to explain. "You paid Lufthansa here for my ticket but it
was issued in Buenos Aires. Lufthansa Berlin sent a PTA by telex to
their office in Buenos Aires instructing them to issue the ticket to
me." He nodded. "Barragán hacked into the airlines' telex system and
sent messages from anywhere in the world, mostly using General Sales
Agents' passwords (we never found out how he got them). So he could have
sent a telex to Lufthansa Buenos Aires making it look like it came from
Lufthansa Berlin, but he really sent it from a public telex/phone booth
in Buenos Aires. The Buenos Aires office would then issue the ticket,
assuming that payment had been made in Berlin. The passenger would have
paid Barragán, or more likely one his agents, for the ticket at a huge
discount. The airline never got a penny.

"And the law?" Higgen asked.

"There was a jurisdiction problem. In this example payment was made in
Germany, ticket issued in Argentina, passenger often innocent. And there
was no real proof that Barragán was the perp."

"How did you know then?"

"I knew, trust me." I was getting tired of doing all the talking.

"I intend to, Robert." He took a pack of Gauloises from his breast
pocket and offered me one. I'd recently given up smoking for the
umpteenth time, but felt that the situation justified a future
definitive renunciation. He lit me with a gold-plated zippo.

"Then how about telling me what I'm doing here." "You'll be visiting
your daughter\...later," he said, just to show that he knew everything*.
"*First though,* *you'll* * be visiting Mr. Barragán." "He's in Berlin?"

"Yes. *East* Berlin."

I coughed on my first drag, took a sip of the excellent coffee to give
that time to sink in, stretched and scratched my ear. "You don't
seriously expect me to go to East Berlin, now do you, Mike?"

He smiled. "Actually yes, I mean what's the problem?" "At that price?"

"Oh, I see." He looked disappointed. I didn't care much if the op ended
right then; after all, I got a free trip to Berlin. But it wasn't to be.

Mike Huggin walked to the door, but not to kick me out. He opened it and
said, "Two sherries, please, Heather." He returned to his seat and
motioned me, avuncularly, to sit again. Heather came in with a bottle of
Spanish sherry and the appropriate cello-shaped glasses. After pouring,
Huggin held up his glass: "*Prost!"*

"I was in M.I. here for gods' sake, Mike. They'll have my name
somewhere." "Oh we've thought of that, Robert," he said crossing his
long legs and leaning back. "You have your Argentinean passport with
you, I assume." I nodded. "Your jerk in Buenos Aires told me to take
it." "Well then, you are an Argentinean named Roberto Fox, not an
American named Robert. No problemo." I shrugged. He was
right\...probably.

"We'll talk about finances later," he said. "Now let me tell you what
your pal Jesus has to do with it."

"Jesús," I corrected.

"Whatever. He's got a travel agency in East Berlin-- " I had to laugh.
"Jesús Barragán has a travel agency in East Berlin? I don't believe it."
"Nevertheless, it's quite true," Huggin said, sipping his sherry. "You
and Hey-*soos *have something in common, you know. His mother is also
German. Her name is Schmidt and she lives with him. He speaks fluent
German and has German citizenship, by the way." He raised both bushy
eyebrows and stared at me as though that revelation should have knocked
me over.

"Go on," is all I said.

"Do you think he's a communist?"

I smiled. "If he is, there's money in it somehow." "That's likely, it's
the only travel agency in the GDR -- except for the official one, which
only handles incoming tourists." "East Germans aren't very big at
traveling, though, they can't even come here," I reminded him.

"True, but government officials, athletes, orchestras -- they all
travel." "And they buy their tickets from\....what's the agency's name?
"UnserFlug International."

"Ugh."

"Quite."

"But it's still not enough to interest Barragán; there's gotta be a con
somewhere." "Possibly, but what we're interested in are the travel
itineraries of government officials ... including KGB people of course."

"It probably has to do with the exchange rate," I said.

"What?"

"Barragán's scam. What'S the Ostmark worth now?" "You get one Westmark
for five Eastmarks at the bank here."

"That's it then. He collects fares in Eastmarks, exchanges them over
there at one to one, then\...well, I have to think about exactly how it
works."

"That's interesting," Higgin said. "It's something you could hold over
him." "Wait a minute, Mike. I was only thinking. I didn't say I was
going there, because I'm not. I'm through with cloak and dagger stuff."
"You said: at that price? That price was the one agreed on in Buenos
Aires before you knew what the op involved. We are of course willing to
pay more." "Such as?"

"Let me tell you how simple it is. Okay?" I didn't answer.

"There's a tour bus that goes over three times a week with a Spanish
speaking tour guide. Leaves at four p.m. and stops for a stroll and
shopping on *Unter den Linden*, where, coincidentally, Jesus has his
agency. You stroll into the agency." He smiled his charming phony smile.
"Simple, right?"

"Then what?"

"You ask to speak with Barragán."

"Why should he want to talk to me?"

"Old times' sake. Also, you're an IATA official." "Which I'm not any
longer."

Huggin opened the file again and took out some business cards, which he
handed to me. They were just like my old ones, but I was now Director,
Fraud Prevention, Europe, based in Geneva. I shook my head.

"We cleared it with IATA," Huggin said. "If anyone asks, they'll say
you're one of them."

"What if he's not there?"

"He'll be there, we know his working hours -- 9 to 3." "Banking hours
there?"

"As a matter of fact, yes."

"So I talk to him," I said. "About what? Which doesn't mean I will, just
curious." "Well, just in case you do, alone and without bugs, which
probably means outside. You would tell him that certain friends want the
itineraries of his passengers, with all the details, *before* they
travel."

"Uh huh, and what's in it for him?"

"It will be well worth his while, you can tell him that." "How much?"

"He should tell you how much he wants." We sat there for a while looking
into space. "Is that bottle empty?" I finally asked.

"Oh, excuse me. Please help yourself." I did.

"If I decided to do this, I'd want ten thousand dollars, in addition to
the one thousand plus 250 per diem," I said, and sat back hoping he'd be
shocked and say no.

But he only poured himself another sherry. "I think that can be
arranged, Robert, assuming Jesus accepts the deal."

I poured my third. "No deal, Mike. This is the GDR you want me to go
into, where they send spies to Siberia before or after the firing squad.
The money has to be up front, like today. I'll open an account in the
Deutsche Bank, closest branch, and you deposit the money. If not, I'm
outa here and thanks for the trip."

He shook his head and sighed like he'd just received bad news, but said,
"Okay, Robert. Open the account and give me the number, here's my
private phone"\...he handed me a card\... "just the number when you
call, it's an answering machine."

Wow! That was too easy, but who was I to complain. "So how do you intend
to proceed?" Huggin asked me.

I starred at him in a way that would have been a growl had it been
vocal, meaning why hadn't he already figured that out. But one thing had
already occurred to me. "Is that travel agency IATA approved?" He didn't
know and asked if it was important. When I said yes, it could be, he
said he'd find out.

"Let me use your phone," I said. I called Fats Slattery at the IATA
Agency Division in Geneva. Fats, a fat Brit, had been there forever
loaded down with boredom, so he seemed genuinely please to get my call.
After the usual small talk, which I had to cut off because he could go
on forever, I said, "You got an approved agent called UnserFlug
International in Germany? It's in the East, Fats, the German Democratic
Republic, not the Federal Republic, just so you go to the right place."

He came back on the line in two minutes. "Got him, Bobby." (He's the
only one except my mother I let call me Bobby.) "It's the only approved
agency in the whole bloody country."

"Who's the owner?"

"Annaliese Schmidt, it says here." I thanked him and promised to stop by
next time I was in Geneva.

"Probably his mother," I told Huggins,

The tour bus picked me up at my hotel -- on time of course, we were in
Germany. I had a seat number on my ticket, which a plump blond
stewardess directed me to. Then occurred one of those events frequent
travelers dream about. Seated in the window seat was a beautiful, leggy
dark-haired beauty. After I sat down next to her she smiled and said
*hola. *The other passengers were also chatting in Spanish, Iberian or
Latin American accented. She looked to be in her mid-thirties, high
cheekbones, slightly up-slanted eyes. She wore a miniskirt, but because
of the cold had black tights under it and wore high, black leather
boots. As the bus rolled towards Checkpoint Charlie we conversed about
the weather, our home countries -- she was from Colombia, she said --
until she handed me her IATA card: Marta Schreyer, Senior Fraud
Prevention Officer. I nodded to myself and sent her a raised CIA
eyebrow.

"So Mike Huggin wants to keep an eye on me after ," I said in English.

"Let's just say to assist to you in any way possible." "In case of
need?"

"Of course. What else?"

I was pissed off at first, but then thought of the \$11,250 in the bank
and calmed down. But why don't these people at least tell you what they
have up their sleeve? I thought. Would I have accepted an "assistant"?
Probably, but I would have argued against it. Why two people? Could look
suspicious, especially to a suspicious bastard like Jesús Barragán.

"I think we should speak Spanish," she whispered, "so as not to attract
attention." She was right, but I had to stay offended for a while. "Is
that what you guys mean by assistance?" She didn't answer.

We drove around East Berlin for a couple of hours. The tour leader
rendered an uncool mix of sightseeing lore and Marxist propaganda. We
stopped on *Unter den Linden*, a huge avenue, and the passengers poured
out, glad for some air, movement and food. I was hungry as well, but had
other things to do. Marta Schreyer --with whom I finally decided to be
friendly, she was, after all, quite a dish-- and I strolled along the
avenue looking at buildings and shops, until we came to "UnserFlug
Interntional Reisebüro". It was an unimposing place with a few dusty
posters in the window of Havana, Moscow and Prague. You couldn't see
inside. I opened the door and walked in first, which is how it's done in
Germany. They say it's to protect the lady (during the middle ages) from
rowdiness inside. Not a bad idea nowadays either.

Two guys who looked more like bouncers than sales people looked up from
what were reading, probably western girlie magazines, or maybe comics,
and looked at us suspiciously. One of them said in a squeaky voice,
"*Wie kann ich Ihnen helfen?" *Which isn't exactly "whadaya want?" but
it sounded like it coming from him. I decided to speak English to stay
in character: "Two tickets to Madrid." He shrugged and looked at the
other guy, who said, "Cheaper on da udder side." What a sales pitch!

"How much?"

"And more quicker."

"How much?"

He sighed and pretended to check an air fares manual, then quoted a fare
that could have got me to Hong Kong First Class. "I'd like to see the
manager," I said, and handed him the IATA card Huggins had supplied. "Me
too," Marta said, and added her card to the mini-pile on the goon's
desk. He studied them, looked from her to me and back again, and looked
at his partner,who shrugged. He went with the cards through a door at
the other end of the room marked "Kein Eintritt" (no entrance). A minute
later who came out with a big smile on his handsome face but my old
buddy Jesús Barragán. It had been seven years, but he didn't look much
different, a few more pounds maybe, a bit less hair. He was dapper as
usual, in fact he reminded me a little of Mike Huggins. Later I
meditated on what he could have become if his karma had him born in
Chicago instead of Santiago del Estero: He might have been the CIA
Station Chief instead of Huggins.

"Roberto," he gushed in Spanish, with a big grin, as though he were glad
to see me -- which he definitely wasn't. "Still with IATA I see. What a
drag, ha ha." I stood and shook his hand, narrowly escaping an embrace.
"And Señora Schreyer, or is it señorita?"

"Either one will do." she answered deadpan.

"I assume this is an official visit?" he said in German, obviously for
the benefit of the goons.

I nodded. "I want to ask you why you sell IATA airlines' tickets at
excessive prices -- far above the published fares." He couldn't help
smiling and I was barely able to keep from laughing. You see, at that
time IATA was concerned with controlling discounted fares; overpricing
was unheard of.

"Well, I'm sure I can explain that," he said with a straight face.
"Would you like to come into my office or do you prefer a delicious East
German beer somewhere near"? I agreed with a nod that it would be better
to talk somewhere without bugs -- electronic ones, that is.

"Wunderbar! Come with me then. He opened the door. "After you, meine
Liebe," he said to Marta and visually undressed her as she passed him.
To me he raised an eyebrow (like Huggins) and smirked. He was cool, no
doubt about it.

We went to a gemütlicher pub around the corner, where Barragán was an
honored guest. He whispered something to the owner and we were led up a
flight of stairs into a private alcove. z"Drei Löwenbräu, Heinz, bitte,"
Barragán told the owner after we were seated at a round table. I didn't
mention that Löwenbräu comes from Munich. He knew that.

"How long have you been in Geneva, Roberto?" he asked.

"Not long. How long have you been in East Berlin?

"Not long." Even Marta had to smile at that. We engaged in such nonsense
smalltalk until the beer arrived along with a plate of pickled herring.

"What can I do you you, *mi amigo*, or I should say *mis amigos*? he
said when the waiter left, smiling at Marta.

"We were wondering how your business is doing", I said. "I mean East
Germans aren't exactly word travelers."

He lifted his glass: "Prost!" We all clicked glasses and sucked the beer
from under the foam, leaving white mustaches. "I do all right," he said.

"You must have government business then."

He smile faded. "Could be."

"In which case you should be swimming in information."

"Should I? What kind of information?"

"Itineraries, travel dates. You know, the kind of information travel
agents always have."

"And what of it?" He speared a herring and ate it. "Hmm, delicious. Too
bad they don't make *empanadas* in Argentina with herring." He never
took his eyes off me, so he was interested.

"There could be people willing to pay for such information."

"Really? You, for instance?"

"No, not me."

"Oh, you're an intermediary then." Touché. In Argentina I used
intermediaries to buy test tickets from him. I didn't answer.

"Who might these people be that you're an intermediary for, Roberto?"

"No one you know."

Long pause, then: "If someone in a position similar to mine wanted to
sell information, he'd certainly want to know how much the buyer is
willing to pay\...don't you think?"

Another pause, then I said, "Such a buyer would probably want to know
how much the seller wanted\...don't you think?"

"Yes, that's a reasonable attitude." He glanced quickly at Marta,
probably wondering why she was there. "I would say that such a person,
the seller I mean, would want 25,000 U.S. dollars up front and an amount
to be agreed upon thereafter for each piece of
information\...er\...gleaned."

"And turned over to the buyer."

"Of course."

Marta kicked me under the table. I stood up and walked in a circle with
my brow knit, trying to look pensive. When I turned back to the table I
glanced at Marta, who nodded, just perceptibly.

I sat down again and looked at Barragán. "*Bueno*, Jesús -- deal." He
took a paper napkin from its holder and wrote a series of letters on it.
"It's a simple letter-number code for an account in UBS Geneva." He
handed it to me. "The kind of thing such a seller would do. Then he
would say: once the money is in the account, the game starts."

We heard a commotion downstairs. People shouting. "We should be going,"
Marta said, "or we'll miss the bus."

"But you haven't finished your beer," Barragán said. Then, "What bus?"

"The wall is down!" someone shouted as we were going single file down
the stairs. *Der Mauer, der Mauer*! they were shouting. Barragán grabbed
a skinny guy by the coat as he was about to run ouT into the street.
"What are you yelling about? What wall is down?" he asked him in German
*"The* Wall, idiot. It's not really down, but anyone can go across now,
they announced it on the radio and the telly."

"*Who* announced it?"

"The government, that's who," the guy said and pushed away. "I'm goin'
west, Mensch!"

We went outside, where it was already dark. People were running down
*Unter den Linden* screaming *To the wall! *We walked to the corner and
I saw our bus still there. I took Marta's arm, but she didn't move.
"No," she said, "Let's walk."

"Why? It's a madhouse?"

"Trust me," she said. "Walk." She had emerged as sort of the boss of the
op, so I walked.

"Wait a minute, Roberto," Barragán said, coming up behind us. "What
bus?" I didn't know what to say, but Marta did. "We came in a tourist
bus, Sr. Barragán. It's right over there."

He looked nervous. "Well look, if you're not going back on it, how about
giving me your seats."

"You're going over?" I said, surprised.

"Why not? Do you realize what this means?" I shook my head. "Never mind,
I just have to pick up someone in my apartment over the office. Do you
think they'll wait?"

"Here's my ticket," Marta said, smiling. "Sr. Fox, why don't you give
him yours, we won't be using them."

I was totally dumbfounded by then, but I handed over my ticket. "Seats
6A and 6B," Marta said. "Have a good trip, Sr. Barragán." Clutching the
tickets, Jesús Barragán ran to the bus and we saw him talking to the
driver, doubtless asking him to wait a few minutes. Marta pulled me away
in the direction the crowd was going.

"What was that all about?" I asked her.

"I'll tell you later, come on."

We ran and ran, past Checkpoint Charlie where a huge mob was pushing to
get through. Finally we came to a spot where people were climbing over
the wall. A cadre of young people were standing on top helping others up
from an array of wooden boxes of all sizes that had been placed inside
to step on. Marta jumped onto a box and was immediately hauled up.
"Come!" she called back to me. "Is that your boyfriend?" one of the
young men asked. "And I wanted to keep you for myself. Oh well, come on,
lucky one." I got on the box, reached up and was on the top of the
Berlin Wall facing a huge cheering crowd on the other side. Marta was
already there beckoning me to jump. I saw others jumping and they were
caught by the people on the ground and doused with beer and kissed, or
just kissed. I jumped, was caught and kissed\...by Marta. Everyone
cheered.

We found a place to sit in a Gasthaus a few blocks away. We were the
only customers because everyone was out in the street. I was exhausted.
Marta coaxed the waiter inside to give us some schnaps.

"Barragán asked if I realized what this means," I said to Marta.
"Perhaps you can enlighten me."

She downed her schnaps and took my shaking hand in hers, but didn't
answer. She was looking at me with beautiful dark eyes. "You know,
Marta," I finally said, melting, "I didn't know the CIA employed such
beautiful spies."

"They don't."

I thought she was being modest. "I want to go back to Argentina with
you, Roberto." "Back?" I said stupidly. "Are you from Argentina?"

"Originally yes, but I have dual\...no, triple citizenship."

"Let me guess: Argentine, U.S. and\...German?"

"That's right, and I think it's time to go home."

"But why, you have a good job here which you seem to be good at." I
grinned my charming, goofy grin.

"Don't tell me you're in love with me?"

"Not quite. But I can feel it coming on."

"Like the flu?"

"Worse. Now tell me what all this means

"All this , my innocent darling, means that the GDR is finished."

"Finished?"

"Without the Wall and the Soviets they can't exist," she said. "Don't
you follow the news -- Gorbachev, perestroika, all that?"

"Well yes, you may be right, but that doesn't explain why you\..."

She sighed as if dealing with a retarded gringo. "I said the CIA doesn't
usually employ such beautiful spies, meaning me." The waiter had left
the schnaps bottle on the bar. I walked over and refilled my glass. I
slumped down in my chair and downed the burning liquid. "Mein Gott --
you're Stasi?" "Ex-Stasi, I just quit." (Stasi was the East German
secret police.)

"But how\..."

"We knew all about you, what you were going to try at UnserFlug."

"You knew? Then there must be a mole in the CIA Berlin office.

"Elementary, my dear Fox." She pushed a lock of hair from my brow.
"Anyway, my Stasi boss had the brilliant idea of planting me in the bus,
knowing you would think I was CIA."

"Wow! And it worked."

"We never trusted Barragán. Frankly, he was robbing us blind with the
help of some high-up party friends. My boss --ex-boss-- is honest, one
of the few, and he was out to get him."

"I see. And now?"

"Now it's all over, and I am so relieved."

"Why did we have to jump over the Wall instead of just taking the bus
back?" It seemed a minor point compared with everything else happening,
but my legs still ached.

"Because that bus, despite everything, will be boarded by Stasi agents
and the people in seats 6A and B will be taken off and arrested, so you,
6B, would have been arrested as a spy. I, 6A, would have been the
witness."

My mouth hung open. "And Barragán -- now?" She smiled. "He'll have a
hard time explaining what he's doing in your seat, but he'll think of
something. Of course if the Wall hadn't collapsed, he'd be doing a lot
of time in Siberia, or worse."

"Nice," I said. "And me?"

"Oh, you would have been exchanged for someone. They might even have got
a Russian for you."

"It's good to feel important."

"Do you want to feel *really* important?" she asked.

"Not *really.*

"Don't tell Mr. Huggins about me. Just say that Barragán agreed, but now
the Wall\...so you don't know what will happen now."

"Sure. And you want to go to Argentina with me?"

"Yes, I really do, but not right now. I have to wrap up some things here
first."

I took Marta's suggestion not to mention her to Mike Huggins. It would
only complicate things. The Wall coming down was complication enough for
him. I did tell him that he had a mole, though. He asked me how I knew.
I said, "Trust me," and left.

I didn't see Marta Schreyer again until a few months later when she rang
my doorbell in Buenos Aires. After an excellent Argentine red wine toast
to our long-awaited reunion on the balcony.-- a whole bottle actually --
we got down to the long-awaited bedroom business.

She worked with the Simon Wiesenthal Foundation hunting Nazis, of which
there were plenty in Argentina. But that's another story.
