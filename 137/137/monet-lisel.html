<p class="intro">Doctor, you say there are no haloes<br />
around the streetlights in Paris<br />
and what I see is an aberration<br />
caused by old age, an affliction.<br />
I tell you it has taken me all my life<br />
to arrive at the vision of gas lamps as angels,<br />
to soften and blur and finally banish<br />
the edges you regret I don't see,<br />
to learn that the line I called the horizon<br />
does not exist and sky and water,<br />
so long apart, are the same state of being.<br />
Fifty-four years before I could see<br />
Rouen cathedral is built<br />
of parallel shafts of sun,<br />
and now you want to restore<br />
my youthful errors: fixed<br />
notions of top and bottom,<br />
the illusion of three-dimensional space,<br />
wisteria separate<br />
from the bridge it covers.<br />
What can I say to convince you<br />
the Houses of Parliament dissolve<br />
night after night to become<br />
the fluid dream of the Thames?<br />
I will not return to a universe<br />
of objects that don't know each other,<br />
as if islands were not the lost children<br />
of one great continent. The world<br />
is flux, and light becomes what it touches,<br />
becomes water, lilies on water,<br />
above and below water,<br />
becomes lilac and mauve and yellow<br />
and white and cerulean lamps,<br />
small fists passing sunlight<br />
so quickly to one another<br />
that it would take long, streaming hair<br />
inside my brush to catch it.<br />
To paint the speed of light!<br />
Our weighted shapes, these verticals,<br />
burn to mix with air<br />
and change our bones, skin, clothes<br />
to gases. Doctor,<br />
if only you could see<br />
how heaven pulls earth into its arms<br />
and how infinitely the heart expands<br />
to claim this world, blue vapor without end.</p>
