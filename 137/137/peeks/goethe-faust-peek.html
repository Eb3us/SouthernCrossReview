        <p class="intro">With hot devotion have I studied<br />
            The law, medicine, philosophy.<br />
            Unfortunately I've been worried<br />
            As well by grim theology.<br />
            Now here I sit like any bore<br />
            No wiser than I was before.<br />
            Master, Doctor I am called,<br />
            But ten years later I'm appalled<br />
            To find that all my learning knows<br />
            Is to lead my students by the nose.<br />
            I see that we have nothing learned,<br />
            And this my heart has badly burned.</p>
