        <p>The art of losing isn’t hard to master;<br />
            so many things seem filled with the intent<br />
            to be lost that their loss is no disaster.</p>
            <p>Lose something every day. Accept the fluster<br />
            of lost door keys, the hour badly spent.<br />
            The art of losing isn’t hard to master.</p>
            <p>Then practice losing farther, losing faster:<br />
            places, and names, and where it was you meant<br />
            to travel. None of these will bring disaster.</p>
            <p>I lost my mother’s watch. And look! my last, or<br />
            next-to-last, of three loved houses went.<br />
            The art of losing isn’t hard to master.</p>
