        <p>After my old man died I became an orphan. My Fairy Godmother and that cricket weren’t around anymore to jump in when things got tough. I guess they figured that once I was a real boy their job was done and they could relax, for which I don't blame them.       </p>
        <p>When the American troops took Palermo there wasn't much else to do but steal bicycles. You'd think I'd have learned by then not to get mixed up with that kind of stuff. I learned all right, but real boys gotta eat. You remember the sly Fox and that miserable Cat who repeated everything he said? They were in pretty bad shape back when I became a real boy, but they bounced back right into the black market, which was like their natural habitat. They got me into the bicycle stealing business, which I'd probably still be doing if an American soldier hadn't adopted me. He was a nice guy, soft heart and all, kinda dumb. One day he left his flashy American bike on the street in front of a bar, chain-locked of course -- but what were chains to me? I had it cut through in no time and was on my way when an MP who didn’t have anything better to do stepped out of the whorehouse next door and I crashed into him. He grabbed me by the neck and asked me where I got the bike, which he figured I stole from an American because no Italian kid had a bike like that, and I said my friend loaned it to me. I said it in Italian, which he didn’t understand, so he whistled for an Italian cop who asked me the same thing in Italian and I gave the same answer. “What friend?” he asked. I pointed to the bar and they dragged me in, bike and all, and demanded that I point out my friend. I was thinking about the odds being all against me. Even if I made a lucky guess and pointed to the bike owner among the twenty or so soldiers in the bar, what’s he going to say? Just then a guy turned around and saw us.</p>
