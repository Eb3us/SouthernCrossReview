        <p>In ancient times mystery centers and schools of initiation were in isolated locations, removed from the many distractions of ordinary life. Harrie Salman, the Dutch philosopher and sociologist, in his book on <em>The Social World as a Mystery Center</em>, maintains that Rudolf Steiner had a markedly different vision of where the mystery centers of modern life take place, namely in the everyday, where we play, live, and work with others. In describing his inner journey and his growing acquaintance with Rudolf Steiner’s work he notes,</p>
        <p><em>Now I began to perceive how new mysteries are enacted between</em> <em>people in everyday life. On this path I discovered the essence of Anthroposophy, namely the search for new social forms for a new spiritual culture and a new spirituality that can arise in meeting others. To me this is the nature of the new mysteries, inaugurated by Rudolf Steiner during the important Conference of 1923. We can work towards a new culture out of a renewed relationship to the spiritual world. But this new culture needs the support of a new social life and the protection of new communities</em>. </p>
        <p>In direct short sentences Salman describes the mysteries taking place in social life based on Rudolf Steiner’s insights. These include the working of social and anti-social forces in the human soul in our time, the archetypal social phenomena of human meeting, conversation and the working of karma, the principles and laws at work in the social world such as the Basic Sociological Law and the Fundamental Social Law. He then outlines the needs Steiner saw for a restructuring of society, acknowledging the three spheres of culture, the state and the economy.</p>
