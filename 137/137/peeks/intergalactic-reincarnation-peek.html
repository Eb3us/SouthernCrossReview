        <p style="font-style: italic;">There has been of old a deep alliance between the psychopathic and the diabolic. Belief in the divine is nothing other than the substantially convinced recognition of the fact that the world is meaningful, that is to say, a spiritual world. Madness is the completest denial of this meaningfulness. More than that, it is the symbol of the meaninglessness of creation embodied in a creature. Where the last vestige of the world's meaning is obliterated in a soul – a very rare occurrence – madness assumes mastery. Thence it comes that ages which deny the divine meaningfulness of the universe are smitten even to blood by collective madness, however reasonable and enlightened they may be in their own conceit.

            Whose love was true, embraces weak,</p>
            
            <p>Her lonely land was distant though,<br>
            beyond Aconcagua's peak,<br>
            I came too late, so I'll never more know</p>
            
            <p>Her glances, the smiles I used to seek,<br>
            The embraces, even though weak, of<br>
            The lady known as Bernadette...</p>
