		<p>The Lord, the Heavenly Hosts, later Mephistopheles.<br />
		The Archangels step forward.</p>
		<p><strong>RAPHAEL</strong></p>
		<p>The sun resounds as once of old<br />
		In loving spheres of motley song,<br />
		Predestined is its journey bold,<br />
		Ripening as it flows along.<br />
		Its sight the angels new strength gives,<br />
		Though none can fathom how its done;<br />
		The inconceivable still lives<br />
		In glory as when the days were one.</p>
		<p><strong>GABRIEL</strong></p>
		<p>How marvelously right<br />
		The splendiferous earth revolves,<br />
		It interchanges heaven's light<br />
		With dismal darkness unresolved,<br />
		It churns the seas and violent rivers<br />
		through rocky soil in convolution,<br />
		and rocks and seas apart are driven<br />
		In swift eternal revolution.</p>
		<p><strong>MICHAEL</strong></p>
		<p>And storms complete with briny bluster<br />
		From sea to land and land to sea,<br />
		Forge a chain from fury's fluster<br />
		That binds the world in harmony.<br />
		A fearful bolt of lightning's flame<br />
		Precedes the devastating thunder;<br />
		But angels worthy of the name<br />
		Revere in awe each daily wonder...</p>
