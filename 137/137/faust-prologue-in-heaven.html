<div style="margin-left:3em">
<p class="intro">The Lord, the Heavenly Hosts, later Mephistopheles.<br />
The Archangels step forward.</p>
<p><strong>RAPHAEL</strong></p>
<p>The sun resounds as once of old<br />
In loving spheres of motley song,<br />
Predestined is its journey bold,<br />
Ripening as it flows along.<br />
Its sight the angels new strength gives,<br />
Though none can fathom how its done;<br />
The inconceivable still lives<br />
In glory as when the days were one.</p>
<p><strong>GABRIEL</strong></p>
<p>How marvelously right<br />
The splendiferous earth revolves,<br />
It interchanges heaven's light<br />
With dismal darkness unresolved,<br />
It churns the seas and violent rivers<br />
through rocky soil in convolution,<br />
and rocks and seas apart are driven<br />
In swift eternal revolution.</p>
<p><strong>MICHAEL</strong></p>
<p>And storms complete with briny bluster<br />
From sea to land and land to sea,<br />
Forge a chain from fury's fluster<br />
That binds the world in harmony.<br />
A fearful bolt of lightning's flame<br />
Precedes the devastating thunder;<br />
But angels worthy of the name<br />
Revere in awe each daily wonder.</p>
<p><strong>ALL THREE</strong></p>
<p>Its sight the angels new strength gives,<br />
Though none can fathom how it's done;<br />
The inconceivable still lives<br />
In glory as when the days were one.</p>
<p><strong>MEPHISTOPHELES</strong></p>
<p>Since you, O Lord, approach us once again<br />
And ask us how our work is getting on,<br />
And since I've given pleasure now and then,<br />
You see me here debating with the throng.<br />
My choice of words leaves much to be desired,<br />
I'm subject to this circle's cruelest scorn;<br />
You'd die laughing at pathos by me inspired,<br />
If laughter were not a thing you'd long forsworn.<br />
About the sun I've nothing to confess,<br />
I only see how men are in a mess.<br />
The god of earth is still his father's son,<br />
As queer as when the days were one.<br />
Somewhat better would he live<br />
Had you forgot heaven's light to give.<br />
His use of reason's minimal,<br />
Lower than the lowest animal,<br />
He seems to be, with permission of Your Grace,<br />
A cricket jumping all around the place,<br />
Who's always spinning and spinning springs,<br />
and in the grass the same old lyric sings;<br />
If only he'd molder in the grass<br />
And not stick his nose in such morass.</p>
<p><strong>THE LORD</strong></p>
<p>Have you nothing else to say?<br />
Must you always arrogance display?<br />
Doesn't anything on earth seem good to you?</p>
<p><strong>MEPHISTOPHELES</strong></p>
<p>No Sir, I find things rotten through and through.<br />
So sorry for humanity am I<br />
That tormenting it almost makes me cry.</p>
<p><strong>THE LORD</strong></p>
<p>Do you know Faust?</p>
<p><strong>MEPHISTOPHELES</strong></p>
<p>The doctor?</p>
<p><strong>THE LORD</strong></p>
<p>My servant.</p>
<p><strong>MEPHISTOPHELES</strong></p>
<p>Of course. He serves you in a special way,<br />
Keeping even food and drink at bay,<br />
Confusion plays the devil with his mind.<br />
Though knowing only fools would take such measures,<br />
He asks that heaven show him orbs sublime<br />
And earth provide him all its pleasures;<br />
Not all that's high nor all that's low<br />
Can satisfy his will to know.</p>
<p><strong>THE LORD</strong></p>
<p>Although he serves me in some confusion,<br />
I'll gladly show him soon the light.<br />
The gardener knows that flowers in profusion<br />
And fruit adorn his trees when all is ripe.</p>
<p><strong>MEPHISTOPHELES</strong></p>
<p>What will you bet? You'll lose, you know,<br />
If me you give permission<br />
To lead him where he longs to go.</p>
<p><strong>THE LORD</strong></p>
<p>As long as he's on earth alive,<br />
So long it's not to you forbidden.<br />
Men must err as long as they still strive.</p>
<p><strong>MEPHISTOPHELES</strong></p>
<p>I thank you, Lord. I've never kept it hidden<br />
That once they're dead I keep my distance,<br />
It's rosy cheeks I love in every instance.<br />
I'm not at home to corpses in my house,<br />
I like to play the game of cat and mouse.</p>
<p><strong>THE LORD</strong></p>
<p>All right, I give you leave to try it.<br />
Seduce that spirit from its primal source<br />
And guide it, should you find a way to beguile it,<br />
Along the fearsome pitfalls of your course;<br />
And stand disgraced when finally you admit:<br />
A good man, in spite of iniquity's force,<br />
Will find the path to truth before he's quit.</p>
<p><strong>MEPHISTOPHELES</strong></p>
<p>Done! It won't take very long.<br />
I have no doubt that I will win the bet,<br />
And when I do, please don't forget the debt,<br />
Allow my triumph its rightful measure.<br />
Dust shall he eat, and with pleasure,<br />
Just like the serpent, my celebrated pet.</p>
<p><strong>THE LORD</strong></p>
<p>Even that you're free to try.<br />
Your kind and you I've never hated,<br />
Of all the spirits who me deny,<br />
The rogue by me the least is rated.<br />
The deeds of men are easily put to sleep,<br />
They love their undisturb√©d rest.<br />
That's why I give them over to his keep,<br />
Who as the devil puts them to the test.<br />
But you, true sons of God, enjoy<br />
The living wealth of beauty's joy.<br />
Let Being -- active and alive forever --<br />
Embrace you in love's delightful folds.<br />
Make fast the things that swerve and sever<br />
With thought that steadfast holds.</p>
<p><strong>MEPHISTOPHELES</strong></p>
<p>I enjoy seeing the Old Man now and then<br />
To make sure our rapport is never broken.<br />
It's damned decent of such a great Lord again<br />
In person with the Devil to have spoken.</p>
