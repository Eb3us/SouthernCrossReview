<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Garamond'>I know, I
know, Darwin is a scientific icon and who am I to presume to refute him. Lets
just say that I am a guy with a mind and mouth of my own who likes to shoot
both off somewhat more than occasionally. Andand yes, I see logical real-life
huge contradictions in Darwinism, contradictions which deserve to be refuted as
intelligently as possible. So much for apologetics.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Garamond'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Garamond'>First of all,
I do not wish to refute Darwins theory completely. I admit, even agree that
there is such as thing as the evolution of species and I admire Darwins great achievement of observation and literate description of the evolutionary
process. Where I stumble over a nasty stone in the path is his conclusion that
the modifications which occur are accidental. Lets take a couple of the most
famous examples: </span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Garamond'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><center><img src="galapagos.gif"></center></p>
<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Garamond'>During Darwins trip to South America aboard The Beagle, he spent two weeks in the Galápagos Islands where he observed the finches which lived on the various islands. The
ones with beaks better suited for eating cactus got more food and thus survived
in arid environments, whereas those with beaks better suited for extracting
nectar from flowers or eating seeds in other environments were the survivors
because of those obvious advantages. He first called this process natural
selection, but later, following Thomas Malthus, also called it survival of the
fittest. Now the question is whether the variations in the finch population was
caused by the environment or the variations occurred first and the affected
birds found themselves already adapted to their new environment  new because
it is assumed that they had originally emigrated from the mainland where the
observed finches had none of the Galápagos variations. </span>
<p><center><img src="finches.gif"></center></p>
<strong><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Garamond;font-weight:normal'>Darwin</span></strong><strong><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Garamond;font-weight:normal'> decided that the
environment was not causing the variations within the finch populations.&nbsp;
He thought that the variation already existed and that nature selected the
most suitable beak shapes for the respective environments and rejected as hopeless
the less useful ones.&nbsp; (Lamarck on the other hand thought that the
environment altered the shape of individuals and that these acquired changes
were then inherited after the fact.) More on this important difference below.
<p><strong><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Garamond;font-weight:normal'>In
1798, </span></strong><strong><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Garamond;
color:#333333;font-weight:normal'>Thomas Malthus</span></strong><strong><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Garamond;font-weight:normal'> an English
clergyman and economist, calculated that human populations will double every 25
years unless there isnt enough food to go around, a rather brutal
natural form of birth control.&nbsp;When Darwin read Malthus' essay he
thought that all plants and animals will potentially increase in population
unless they are constantly kept in check by predators, diseases, and
limitations in food, water, and other resources that are essential for
survival.&nbsp;In other words: survival of the fittest through natural
selection, according to which those least likely to die off are most likely to
pass on their traits to the next generation of birds, mice, moths and men.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Garamond;font-weight:normal'>An
example of evolution resulting from so-called natural selection was discovered
among &quot;peppered&quot; moths living near English industrial cities during
the 19<sup>th</sup> century. &nbsp;The moths vary in coloration from light to
dark.&nbsp; Soot and smoke from coal burning furnaces killed the lichen on
trees and darkened the bark.&nbsp; According to theory, when moths landed on
these trees and other blackened surfaces, the dark colored ones were harder to
spot by birds who ate them and, subsequently, they more often lived long enough
to reproduce.&nbsp; Over generations, the environment continued to favor darker
moths.&nbsp; As a result, they progressively became more common.&nbsp; By 1895,
98% of the moths in the vicinity of English cities like Manchester were mostly
black.&nbsp; Since the 1950's, air pollution controls have significantly
reduced the amount of heavy air pollutants reaching the trees. As a result,
lichen has grown back, making trees lighter in color.&nbsp; In addition, once
blackened buildings were cleaned making them lighter in color.&nbsp; Now, according to Darwinist theory,
natural selection favors lighter moth varieties so they have become the most
common.&nbsp; This trend has been well documented by field studies undertaken
between 1959 and 1995 by Sir Cyril Clarke from the University of Liverpool.&nbsp; The same pattern of moth wing color evolutionary change in response to
increased and later decreased air pollution has been carefully documented by
other researchers for the countryside around Detroit, Michigan.&nbsp; </span></strong></p>
<p><center><img src="moths.gif"></center></p>
<p><strong><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Garamond;font-weight:normal'>While
it is abundantly clear that there has been an evolution in peppered moth
coloration due to the advantage of camouflage over the last two centuries, it
is important to keep in mind that this story of natural selection in action is
incomplete, because there may have been additional factors involved.
Furthermore, one may question whether light colored moths even attempted to alight
on the lichenless trees or that dark ones were particularly attracted to
lighter colored ones. Or that predator birds are really fooled by the color of
moths.[1]</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Garamond;font-weight:normal'>What
most bothers me, however, is the assumption that the variations in form or
color of the creatures involved occurred before their residence in favorable
environments. If that were the case, our mysterious natural selection would
have had to know beforehand that a select number of the species intended to
emigrate to the environments which most suited their variation and granted them
the requisite visas of beak form or color. Darwinists must deny this of course
 but what other explanation do they have? Oh yes: that there was a previous
accidental mutation which just happened to correspond to the future alien
homeland. That such a thing may have happened a few times is at least
plausible, but that it has happened innumerable times in the evolutionary
history of the earth is just as likely as that a monkey typing away at a
computer will eventually write the Bible if given enough time. The only real
evidence in the two phenomena mentioned is that the beaks of certain Galápagos
finches are indeed suited to their environment and that dark moths live on dark
tree bark and light moths live on light bark. The Why and the How, however, are
pure speculation. Ingenious yes, but unproven. Furthermore, if the variations occurred <i>after</i> the creatures moved to new locations, Darwin's theory collapses like a carelessly constructed castle of cards, because in that case the cause is known and it's not natural selection, but the environment. </span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Garamond;font-weight:normal'>Lets
move on now to man, the subject which most interests us, becausewellits us! The
extant animals that look most like man are the apes. They have two legs and two
arms  although the arms also serve as legs -, hands which can grasp objects and
groom their peers; they nurture their young. They mostly live in trees.
Although they possess a
certain limited intelligence, they can not speak, which raises the question
about their ability to think or whether their intelligence is equivalent to
instinct. The Darwinist theory is that one day one of them, due to an
accidental variation (in the brain?) decided to descend to earth and stay there
 although its hard to see the practical advantage to this. Then another
mutation transformed grunts into words and upright carriage. Until finally,
voilá! A real guy or doll. (Sorry for the irony, but the whole thing is so
simplistic that I cant help myself.) A problem I see is: Why dont apes
continue to evolve and become more human? Also: Where is the missing link
between them and man? A possible answer to the first question is that evolution
is too slow to notice; and to the second that there are bony vestiges of
proto-humans, such as, and especially, the Neanderthals. But the Neanderthals
lived for thousands of years co-existent with humans. How, then, could one
group of partners  or more likely enemies  evolve from the other? Was there
inter-species mating? Who knows? But even if there was its not evolution, it's
procreation. A more modern idea is that those proto-human species were branches
that died off without being able to continue their evolution. This sounds
eminently reasonable, but is again speculation.                             </span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Garamond;font-weight:normal'>According
to Karl Popper, The mark of a scientific theory is whether it makes
predictions that could in principle serve to falsify it. In other words: Can
it be falsified? If we accept this definition, then Darwinism isnt even a
respectable theory because it cannot be falsified. Oh, elements of it can.
Spurious bones have been found in order to enhance a scientists reputation.
But I am not refuting evolution as such, only the philosophical, the
speculative, the How and the Why. There is no way to falsify the concept of
natural selection which in any case is a mere metaphor: how can selection
occur naturally, i.e., without being consciously selected? (See Don Cruse's articles on this subject in <a href="https://southerncrossreview.org/scr_Archives.htm">Archives</a>).</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Garamond;font-weight:normal'>I
am not offering a competing theory, only attempting to refute Darwin by calling
the causal part of his theory speculative and therefore unproven and unscientific.
Others have probably done it better, but at the moment Darwinism is king and
queen and anyone questioning it is called a creationist or ingenuous. I agree
with the philosopher Thomas Kuhn who asserted that the history of science is
punctuated by violent intellectual revolutions that overturn long periods of
conservative puzzle-solving...and research which questions the current accepted
theories are debunked as wild and useless speculation." So there is no <i>gradual</i>
development of scientific thought, but rather sudden jumps of genius which
overthrow what was previously considered gospel truth.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Garamond;font-weight:normal'>I
am confident that just as Copernicus dethroned Aristotle and Ptolemy, and
Einstein rocked Newtons universe, someone will come along sooner or later to overthrow
Darwinist orthodoxy and deface the icon.       </strong></p>
