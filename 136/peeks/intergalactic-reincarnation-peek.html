        <p>Bernadette meant very much to me. Please, however, do not imagine some kind of passionate, tragic love affair. In fact, we only ever spent a total of three days together spaced over several years, in two different continents, and during only one unbroken twenty-four hour period. So the love that existed between us, although also physical, was mostly spiritual.</p>

I do hate to use a corny expression like “love at first sight”, so I won't. However, what I felt was more like recognition at first sight, that this was someone I already knew, although I had never seen her before.</p>
