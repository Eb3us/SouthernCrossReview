# To Hunt a Nazi

## by Roberto Fox -- as told to Frank Thomas Smith


*Time past and time future\
What might have been and what has been\
Point to one end, which is always present.*

T.S. Eliot

There are moments in the present, but also in the past and I hope
in the future, when I have the urge to pull Eliot out from my book
case and read *Four Quartets.* The moments are usually when I'm
bogged down with a story or a poem and think that a solution
simply isn't possible. Somehow *Quartets* -- only that, not other
poems by Eliot or any other poet -- inspires me, or at least gives
me hope that anything is possible.

I was meditating on these three lines when the phone rang. I was
sitting at my desk with my back to my picture-window overlooking
the Buenos Aires municipal golf course in Palermo Park. I can't
face the park while working because its beauty distracts me.
Anyway it was foggy, a common occurrence on autumn mornings,
though the sun usually burns the fog away by mid-morning. I picked
up the phone and swiveled around towards the park: "*Hola"*

"Mr. Roberto Fox, please?" a woman's voice asked in
English.

"Speaking."

"One moment please, Mr. Fox, I'll connect you to Ms. Gutiérrez."
Obviously an executive type too busy to dial her own numbers.
Strike one. After a minute of *The Four
Seasons* I was about to hang up when..."Mr.
Fox?"

"Yes, I already said so."

"I'm so sorry to keep you waiting; another call, very urgent,
came just as we were trying to get you." 

"That's okay," I lied, "what can I do for you?"

"I'm Andrea Gutiérrez of the Simon Wiesenthal Foundation in
Vienna." She waited for me to react, but I didn't. "Do you know
about us, Mr. Fox?" She had a slight Spanish
accent.

"Yes, you hunt Nazis. As far as I know Mr. Wiesenthal gave Mossad
the tip that led to the capture of Eichmann in Buenos Aires
in...when was it?"

"1963. Yes, you are informed."

"Not really. I read *The House on Garibaldi
Street* about the operation."

"It's very informative."

"Again, what can I do for you, Ms. Gutiérrez?"

"I'll be in Buenos Aires on Wednesday..." (it was Sunday) "...and
I'd like to speak with you when I'm there."

"What about?"

"About the possibility of you helping us...but I'd rather not go
into details on the phone, if you don't mind."

"I don't mind, except I'd like to know how you got my name and
why you think I can or should help you."

"Osvaldo Romberg gave me your name."

"Osvaldo?" I said, becoming intrigued. He'd worked as an
undercover agent for me back during my spook days. "I haven't seen
him in decades. Where is he now?"

"Israel, he's a well known artist there." Her voice was getting
lower and her sentences shorter, so it was obvious that she wasn't
thrilled about giving any information over the phone. "Will you
have some time for me on Wednesday, Mr. Fox?"

"Okay. What time?"\
"Five-ish?"

"No ishes, please."

"Five then."

"Where?"

"Your apartment?"

"All right. It's La Pampa..."

"I know where it is."

"Uh huh. And what else do you know about me?"

"I'll tell you on Wednesday. Thank you." (click)

I'd almost forgotten about Andrea Gutiérrez by Wednesday morning
when I opened my appointments book and saw her name. I frowned,
shrugged, laced up my running shoes, and took the squeaky elevator
down the four floors to the exit, which opened right into the
park. I started my leisurely jog around the lake in brilliant
autumn sunshine, waving to the ducks who seemed annoyed that I had
no tidbits to give them. At least fifteen girls in shorts,
jiggling tits and ponytails overtook me like fillies passing an
old dray horse -- some twice. I was used to it.

I almost knocked down our *portero* when I pulled up at the
entrance to my apartment building. "*Buen dia,* *Don Roberto,*" he
said, exuding the odor of last night's wine and garlic. "Still
running, I see." He thought I was mad for wasting all that energy
for nothing.

"*Buen dia*,
*Julio*," I answered. "Yes, and
someday I'll get where I'm going." He laughed, more convinced than
ever of my insanity.

I checked the web and found that the Wiesenthal Foundation had an
office in Buenos Aires, so why the hell were they calling me from
Vienna -- and why were they calling me at all? Forget it and
concentrate on your work, I told myself. Reading *Four Quartets*
the day before had gotten me over a bump in imagination and I was
sailing through the pages of my book. After a few hours I called
it a day (I'm no workaholic) and walked over to an Italian
restaurant on Avenida Libertador, where I indulged in a delicious
dish of mostacholes and a small bottle of *Santa Julia Malbec* red
wine. Then I strolled back home and read some Dostoyevsky in bed
as preparation for my daily siesta. I remembered Ms. Gutiérrez
though, and set the alarm for 4:30.

At six o'clock I was still reading Dostoyevsky and sipping *mate*
tea through a bronze straw when the phone rang. "The airport was
fogged in," Andrea Gutiérrez said rapidly without identifying
herself. "We were diverted to Sao Paulo, then there was a
mechanical problem. I just arrived. I\'m in the airport I can be
at your place in a half hour."

"Forty-five minutes would be more like it," I said, "but you must
be exhausted."

"I am, but I must see you today."

"Okay, I'll be waiting."

It was worth the wait. She was certainly exhausted, but she'd
obviously done the best she could in the airport ladies' room
before taking a taxi for the long drive to the city. She was about
thirty, maybe a bit more, had long black hair parted in the
middle, large black almost unblinking eyes, very thin with no
breasts to speak of, and quite beautiful in a Latin way, which is
my favorite way.

"*Máte*?" I asked, offering her the
gourd.

She frowned. "I could really use a cup of coffee, Mr. Fox."

"It's instant," I warned, "but good instant. Milk? And let's drop
the formalities; I'm Roberto."

"I thought you were American."

"Right, but everyone calls me Roberto here."

"Oh, like in *For Whom the Bell
Tolls*?"

"Something like that, but I don't wear a hat."

"Black, please, one sugar."

The fog had cleared by midday, so I could watch the golfers from
the kitchen window while waiting for the water to boil. I promised
myself for the umpteenth time to take up the game someday.

"So, Andrea, I ask you once more: What can I do for
you?"

She lifted her attaché case onto her lap, clicked the fasteners
but didn't open it. "We'd like you to find someone for us."

I lifted my eyebrows as though surprised. "Some Nazi?"

"Yes, his name is Walter Kutschmann."

"And why do you want me, of all people, to find
him?"

She crossed her legs, shapely ones by the way, and flipped up the
attaché lid. "Osvaldo Romberg told me you were an airline
investigator and are now a private detective."

"As I already told you, Andrea, I haven't seen Osvaldo in a dog's
age, so he's not up to date. It's true that I
*was* an investigator for the
International Air Transport Association and that I
*was* a private detective. But now
I'm neither." I smiled, if you can call what my face does a smile.
"Sorry to disappoint you."

"Oh? Are you retired then?"

"I took early retirement from IATA, saved something of the
detective income, and along with the pittance I earn as an author,
I get by quite well here because of the favorable exchange
rate."

"I see, but..."

"Hold on. You're getting my whole bio and I don't know anything
about you." she didn't like that, I could tell. 

"What would you like to know?" she said.

"Are you Jewish?"

"Yes."

"Are you using your real name?"

She didn't answer right away, probably deciding whether to act
offended or not. Finally she smiled. "Why do you ask that?" as
though it were a ridiculous question.

"Gutiérrez is a fairly common name around here, I know a half
dozen, and none of them are Jews. Are you Israeli?"

"Yes, and my name is Sara Romberg. Satisfied?"

"Ah - related to Osvaldo?"

"Cousins."

"Wonderful. Why the phony name then? Wait, let me guess:
Mossad."

"Wrong. Simon Wiesenthal Foundation."

"One doesn't necessarily preclude the other."

"Yes it does," she said. "We stay as far away from Mossad as
possible."

"In order to stay out of trouble?"

"Yes, and for public relations reasons, especially since
Eichmann. Also, Mossad has other priorities now."

"That I can believe -- like Palestine, Iran, not to mention
Washington. Sorry, I couldn't resist the Washington
bit."

"Why? It's true. We must remain above suspicion. When we find out
where a Nazi is we notify Germany first, then the country where
his crimes took place, which could be Germany, Poland, Russia,
France, etcetera." 

"What about the country he's in?"

"Depends on the country and if there's already a warrant out for
his arrest."

"Argentina?"

"Depends. Look Roberto, can we get to the point?"

Now it was my turn to smile, inwardly at least. I was no longer
controlling the conversation, which was unusual, but what the
hell, I like change. "Sure, shoot."

She sighed histrionically. "Thanks. Are you willing to help?"

"Good question. Now here's mine: Why should I?"

"We'll pay you of course." This was getting serious.


"Do you know T.S. Eliot, Sara?"

"She frowned. "Some."

"Four Quartets?"

"*April is the cruelest month*."

"Right, very good. It's April, when I'm especially susceptible to
cruelty, so..."

"What could be crueler than the holocaust?"

"Good point. What did this guy ... Kutch...what?"

"Kutschmann, Walter Kutschmann."

"What did he do?" 

She finally opened the attaché-case and took a file out, then
closed the case and placed it on the table. "Gestapo
SS-Untersturmführer Dr. Walter Kutschmann," she read from the
file, "responsible for the murder of twenty Polish professors and
their families in Lemberg in 1941, as well as having participated
in the murder of several thousand Jewish inhabitants of the cities
of Brzezny and Podhajce..." She handed me two sheets of paper.
"Here's his biography."

"Nice guy," I said after having read it. "He deserted to Spain in
1944. How do you know he's in Argentina?"

"Mr. Wiesenthal found out. I think he just guessed, because as
you must know Argentina is a favorite postwar Nazi destination. He
checked with a source in Rome, who advised him that Kutschmann
obtained a Vatican passport and an Argentine visa in 1946, both
under a false name."

"What name?"

"That would make it too easy," she said wryly. "We don't
know."

"How do you know the source is reliable then?"

"She always has been. You mentioned Eichmann.

"But that was a Mossad operation."

"Our source is well connected to the German community in Spain,
and used to give the information to Mossad when they were still
interested. As I already told you, they aren't any more. So she
came to us."

"So what she knows is hearsay."

"Very reliable hearsay, yes".

"Together with Wiesenthal's intuition."

She stared at me for a good minute, then said, "Simon Wiesenthal
is a great man. I'll tell you a story about him. His friend, also
a former Mauthausen concentration camp inmate, related it to me.
They were together at the friend's house. He had become a
well-to-do jewelry manufacturer. After dinner he said, 'Simon, if
you had gone back to building houses, you\'d be a millionaire. Why
didn\'t you?' 'You\'re a religious man,' replied Wiesenthal. 'You
believe in God and life after death. I also believe. When we come
to the other world and meet the millions of Jews who died in the
camps and they ask us, What have you done? there will be many
answers. You will say, I became a jeweler, another will say, I
have smuggled coffee and American cigarettes. Another will say, I
built houses. But I will say, I did not forget you.' Simon
Wiesenthal has very good intuition."

I had already more or less decided to do what I could for these
good people, but a couple of things still bothered me. I said,
"Okay, Sara, maybe I can help you, but I still have two
questions."

"Yes?" she said, leaning forward as if I had already accomplished
something.

"Why the false name if you're only representing
Wiesenthal?"

"She smiled, obviously relieved. "It's not false. I was born in
Argentina as Andrea Gutiérrez because my father, when arriving
here before the war without documents, told the immigration people
his name -- Georg Romberg -- but the clerk didn't understand him,
or didn't want to, so he wrote Jorge Gutiérrez on the entry
document he gave my father. So that was our name until we
emigrated to Israel, when I was a child, where we got back our
identity."

I nodded, having heard stories like that before. "Are you still an
Argentine citizen?"

"Yes, I have both passports. And you, Roberto? Fox could be a
Jewish name."

I thought of something I hadn't thought of in decades. "There was
a rumor that a great-grandfather was a Jewish money lender -- a
fox -- in Liverpool, but my father vehemently denied it."

She laughed, flashing uneven but sexy teeth. Can teeth be sexy?
"Good, then you have motivation. What else do you want to know?"

"Going back to the 'why me' question. That I was with IATA and a
private investigator, and that I was recommended by Osvaldo
Romberg, still doesn't seem sufficient motive for you, and Mr.
Wiesenthal with his excellent intuition, to be so anxious to
employ me for this particular job."

She seemed to be ready for that one, too. "You speak German, even
translated a book from German to English when you lived in
Germany."

"You *have* done your homework.
Yes, *Das Mikado Projekt*, it
became a best seller, much to everyone's surprise. But I had done
the translation for a small fixed fee, so that didn't help me
much. I also wrote the screen play and acted in the German film
and insisted on a share of the profits. It flopped." We both
laughed.

"Anything else?" I insisted. "Speaking German is helpful, but
still..."

"There is something else," she interrupted, "the most important
thing about you, Roberto."

I waited.

"You have contacts with the German community
here."

"Do I?"

"The Rudolf Steiner Schule, for example."

"Oh that. But no, I have no direct contact with the school; I
only know a few anthroposophists, who can hardly be called Nazis.
In fact..."

"...where a certain Jessica Kutschmann, former Hitler-Jugend
group leader, teaches physical education. Do you know
her?"

I was stunned. "No, I don't know any teachers at the school. She
must have been very young."

"Yes, they were all mostly very young. But it's not about
her."

"So you think she's related to Kutschmann. Or do you know
it?"

"We're not sure, but the name is not common. And there's a
resemblance."

\

I knew -- and still know -- a few Germans here in Argentina
because I used to live in a Buenos Aires suburb, Florida --
pronounced Flor-**eee**-da -- where many German immigrants settled
during and after the war, including some Nazis and some Jews, who
seemed to get along quite well there. Occasionally I would stop
off in a bar-restaurant ostentatiously named "Maxim", owned and
run by Heinz, a professional waiter, conscript in the German army
during WWII, who had surrendered to the Americans in Italy and
subsequently worked as a bartender-waiter in an NCO club, during
which time he also met, impregnated and wed his Italian wife,
Venusia. He considered the American army to be the best employer
he ever had, but was laughingly critical because they kept
encouraging him to escape. He did, finally, but not to a hungry
Germany-in-ruins. He stowed away on an Argentine ship. On arrival
in Buenos Aires he stood in line with the crew, who had fed him
during the journey and taught him the only Spanish word he knew:
*tripulante* (crew), which got him off the ship in Buenos Aires
with nary a nod from the migrations official. After working for a
year as a waiter in a German restaurant, he sent for Venusia and
the daughter he had never seen. Happy ending: "Maxim", where
Venusia was the cook and had to learn to prepare *Eisbein mit
sauerkraut* for the German customers, despite considering it
barbaric.

Eichmann (using the alias Clement) had been a customer there,
according to Heinz, but he always ordered a bottle of cheap wine
and a Schnitzel and sat in a corner by himself reading the *Freie
Presse*, Buenos Aires's fascist newspaper. In my time, a couple of
years later, the bar customers were mostly Germans who had
prospered in Argentina as businessmen; the only exception being an
alcoholic former U-boat commander. I rather liked going there to
practice my rusty German, and they liked having a real-life
American to berate for stupidly letting the Russians take half of
Europe. I couldn't help agreeing with them, but my
counter-argument that they had only themselves to blame was hard
to rebut.

One longtime resident was a philosopher of sorts and we had
interesting discussions about politics, religion and life in
general. He was a pragmatist and called me a romantic. He went so
far as to suggest that I meet up with the anthroposophists, who
held similar outlandish views.

"Ah, here's one now," he exclaimed one evening. A thin elderly
man, slightly stooped, had entered with a younger woman who had
oriental features. The philosopher introduced them as Herr und
Frau Kunst, and suggested to Herr Kunst that they invite me to
their table as someone who was almost as crazy as they. He said it
with a big smile and the couple laughed. "We'll find out which of
us is crazy on the other side," Herr Kunst retorted. The
philosopher laughed, shook hands with them, said, "Indeed we will,
if there is another side," tipped his hat to me and left.


"Please do join us, Herr...Sorry, I didn't get the
name."

"Fox," I said, "but I don't want to intrude." 

"Not at all, we are always glad to have a guest for lunch, and
our philosopher friend must have had a reason for suggesting
it."

Once seated, they both ordered pasta, and I followed suit. "Frau
Venusia makes excellent Italian food, which in any case is better
than the German," Frau Kunst said.

"Yes," her husband agreed, "and it's because she puts her heart
into it." Then, looking at me with clear blue eyes, "I detect an
accent, Herr Fox. You are not German, I presume."

I told him how I had learned German when I was stationed in
Germany in the U.S. army. I didn't mention my previous studies in
German and Russian at the Army Language School in Monterey. Herr
Kunst congratulated me, saying that few Americans learned German.
"I've never been able to completely master German grammar,
though," I said, "which is tortuous."

"You do very well," Frau Kunst objected. "Gunther and I are still
struggling with Spanish after all these years."

Cutting off the small talk, Gunther Kunst asked me why the
philosopher had initiated our meeting. "Why are you almost as
crazy as we?"

"He said I should meet the anthroposophists because I'm a
romantic -- according to him."

"I see. So you've never heard of anthroposophy or Rudolf
Steiner?" 

I admitted my ignorance of the subject so they invited me to
participate in a study group in their home. Normally I would have
begged off, but the conversation leading up to the invitation
interested me. Apparently this Steiner was an occidental initiate
who coalesced the eastern philosophy of reincarnation with western
science and Christianity and founded a movement called
anthroposophy. I had been going to the meetings for over a year
prior to Sara Romberg's arrival on the scene. That was what she
called my "contacts in the German community". I would have laughed
at her when she said that, for the people in my study group,
despite being German, were certainly not connected with Nazis. In
fact, anthroposophy had been banned in Nazi Germany and Gunther
Kunst, it turned out, was Jewish. Except for one thing.

One of the members of the group was Wolfgang Kleinhuber, director
of Osram, a large German electrical appliances company, in
Argentina. One evening I asked Frau Kunst to call a taxi for me
because my car was being repaired in a garage. Kleinhuber offered
to drop me off at home as we were going in the same direction. On
the way we stopped in a café on Avenida Libertador. Kleinhuber,
knowing that I had worked for IATA, wanted to ask me a few
"technical" questions.

Kleinhuber wanted to know if sales agents -- passenger and cargo
-- received different levels of commission from the airlines
depending on their production, and if such "over-commissions" were
passed on to the agents' clients. Easy question, easy answer: yes.
So it is obviously beneficial for a client, especially a large
company, to buy transportation from a good producing agent. Then
he asked me if I knew the agency "All-Ways". I did of course, and
told him that they were one of the largest producers in the
country.

"They're Jews, aren't they?" Kleinhuber asked matter-of-factly. I
answered affirmatively in the same manner.

He studied his coffee-cup a moment, then asked, "Are they
reliable?"

"As far as I know, yes. Why do you ask?"

"Well, we're thinking of changing agencies and All-Ways has been
recommended. But my sales manager is reluctant. He has a thing
about Jews." He shrugged, smiling.

"I would think it would be the other way around."

"What do you mean?"

"That they'd have a thing about Germans."

The sarcasm rolled right off him. "No, I understand they give a
lot of business to Lufthansa."

"Well, you're the boss," I said, "not him."

"True, but a sales manager must sell, and mine is very good." He
looked down at the table as though thinking. "His sister is a
teacher at the Rudolf Steiner School in Florida." Kleinhuber meant
that as some kind of recommendation, I guess. 

"I think I'll have a beer," I said. "How about you?" The subject
as making me thirsty. We ordered a bottle of Heineken. After the
first glass, Kleinhuber invited me to lunch at the German club the
following week, wanted me to meet his sales manager. The German
club was the last place I wanted to have lunch, but the dangling
strings were coming together in a way which made it impossible for
me to refuse. 

The German Club in Buenos Aires looks like it had been
transplanted directly from Prussia in the nineteenth century. When
I arrived I saw Kleinhuber leaning against the bar talking with a
guy I assumed to be his Sales Manager.

"Sorry I'm late, Wolfgang," I lied, "got caught in traffic." It
was only ten minutes after the agreed time, which for Argentines
is early, but for Germans is late.

"Not a problem, Roberto," he smiled. \"I'd like you to meet Pedro
Olmo. Pedro, Roberto Fox."

The other guy turned to face me. He was tall and well built,
around sixty, obviously in shape, graying black hair brushed
straight back, bushy eyebrows and a mouth cum protruding lower lip
which seemed too low for his face, immaculately dressed. He bowed
slightly and said, "*Sehr angenehm*." He may have been pleased to
meet me, but his unsmiling face didn't show it. I assumed they had
been talking about Kleinhuber's interest in using All-Ways as
Osram's travel agency and his sales manager's aversion to the
idea. And I was there to convince him.

"What will you have to drink, Robert"? Kleinhuber
asked.

"Is that sherry you're drinking?"

"Yes, excellent Spanish sherry," Pedro Olmo replied in excellent
German. Pedro Olmo? So what? I told myself. Argentina has a large
German-Argentine community and many second generation Argentines
speak fluent German. 

I ordered the same and we engaged in small talk about the traffic
and Argentina's chances to win the World Cup, then moved to our
reserved table. The waiter was Argentine, so we ordered in
Spanish. Pedro Olmo's accent was thicker than the steak he
ordered. Having consumed his *bife de lomo* and quite a bit of
German white wine, Olmo opened up a bit. He thought that
Argentina's team was very good, but undisciplined; therefore he
was betting on Germany. He even smiled, something he did with a
certain charm. I told them I liked Brazil, which shut them up.
Personally I neither like soccer nor understand it, but during
many years living among fanatics I'd learned that everyone loves
Brazil's imaginative soccer, whether they win or lose.

Finally Kleinhuber came to the point. "Robert, you know the agency
All-Ways. We're thinking of changing agencies and would like to
know what you think of them -- if you don't mind of course."

Had he really not told Olmo of our previous conversation? I
pretended to think about it, then said, "Well, I only know them
professionally, but I can safely say that they have a successful
business with many important clients."

"I understand that the owners are Jews," Olmo said, coming right
to the point.

"Not only the owners," I said, "but most of the employees as
well."

"Do you think they would like working with
Germans?"

"Oh," I asked innocently, "are you German?\...I mean the
name..."

"Many people ask that," Pedro Olmo said, smiling. "You see, my
father was Spanish and my mother German; I was born in Spain but
grew up in Germany. Are the All Ways people German Jews?," he
asked, getting off the subject of himself.

"The owner, Saul Gurfein, although he has a German name, came
originally from Russia I think. So we have two cases in which the
name doesn't tell the real story."

"What?"

"You both have German names and yours from Spain and his from
Russia."

"Oh yes, a coincidence."

"What about prices, Robert?" Kleinhuber said. "Do you think that
they would be cheaper?"

I repeated what I had already told Kleinhuber about
over-commissions for Olmo's benefit. I added that Lufthansa
probably paid them even more over-commission than other airlines
because they were interested in penetrating the Jewish market.
"Jews have been reluctant to fly on Lufthansa, and they want to
change that."

"Indeed? Why should they want to change it?" Olmo asked with an
arched right eyebrow, I pretended not to get it.

"What do you mean?" 

"*Nada*."

"Pedro has had some unpleasant experiences with Jewish business
men," Kleinhuber tried to explain, "that's all.\" He turned to
Olmo: \"But there are all kinds of individuals, and if Herr Fox
recommends these people, I think we should try
them."

"You're the *jefe*," Olmo said,
"but please remember that I must deal with them."

"And I think that will do you good, help you get over some of
your prejudices."

Olmo glared at his boss, looked like he would continue to argue,
thought better of it and said, "Perhaps you're right. Would you
like to bet on the World Cup, Herr Fox?"

"Sure," I said, anxious to get away. "I'll take
Brazil."

"And I Germany," Olmo said. "How about you,
Wolfgang?"

"Argentina," Kleinhuber said. "And the winner will pay for lunch
at the Club."

Olmo laughed, I grinned. "*Gut*, Wolfgang," he said. "I'll be glad
to pay for betting on Germany's honor -- and winning."

\

"This guy Pedro Olmo is as German as they come," I told Sara
Romberg, "and has an unbelievable story about his father being
Spanish and his mother German."

"It's possible," she interrupted.

"Anything is possible. That's not the point."

"Sorry I interrupted," she said. "What were you about to
say?"

"You told me that Jessica Kutschmann is a teacher at the Steiner
School."

"Yes."

"Pedro Olmo´s sister is also a teacher at that school," I
said.

Her eyes widened and she smiled for the first time since I\'d met
her.

"Wow! We\'re getting close, Roberto," she said. "If it is him, do
you think Kleinhuber knows?"

"I don't know. But an innocent German doesn't change his name for
nothing. Is there any chance of finding out the name on the
passport the Vatican gave Kutschmann?"

She shook her head. "No, once they realized we were getting
information from them, St. Peter closed the door to those archives
and threw away the keys."

"...to the kingdom?" I added. "Sorry. How about Kutschmann's
fingerprints?" 

We were sitting on my balcony with the light of a full moon
filtering threw the high plane trees. Sara had come in a
tight-fitting dress with a Chinese slit on the side. She looked
much more appetizing than when I first met her fresh off a
long-haul flight; more so even than the excellent pasta with
mushroom sauce we had just finished. She took a sip of wine and
thought for a moment. I was somewhat in love with her and she was,
I could feel, ready to reciprocate. Whether it came to anything or
not has nothing to do with this account, so I'll leave you to
guess.

"If we don't already have them, we can get them," she said. "Do
you have Olmo's prints?"

"I'm not a magician, but he might be an Argentine
citizen."

"He almost certainly is," she confirmed. "These people want to
get rid of the Vatican passports as quickly as
possible."

"Right, good. So we can get his prints and match them with
Kutschmann's."

"How"

It's not *what* you know around here." I looked at my watch.
Midnight. Perfect. I brought my wireless phone to the table and
dialed Comisario Alberto Contreras' number. His wife answered and
I could hear a soccer game in the background on TV. After
exchanging pleasantries she called Alberto to the phone.

"Damn it, Zorro, can't a guy have some peace in his own home," he
growled. Ever since he discovered that my name means zorro in
Spanish, he loved to throw it at me when he was in a good
humor.

"I know you're bored sitting there watching the idiot tube, my
contrary friend, so I'm going to give you something interesting to
think about."

"Go ahead and ruin my day."

Alberto is my contact in the Argentine Federal Police -- a very
good cop and an honest one. When he works with me he gets credit
for the arrest, if there is one, and cash when I'm paid for my
efforts, which isn't always the case. "How'd you like to hunt a
Nazi?"

"How'd you like to leave me out of politics for a
change?"

"That's no answer."

"What have you got, Zorro?"

First I told him what Kutschmann had done in Poland.

"A prick," was his only comment.

Then I gave him an abbreviated version of what I knew about Olmo.

"So what do you want from me?"

"Pedro Olmo is a naturalized citizen. Therefore, since the
Federal Police -- that's you -- issues identity documents and
passports, you should have his prints on file."

"Do you have Kutschmann's prints?"

"Not yet, but I will."

"I got news for you, Roberto," he said. "Those Nazi pricks got
protection here; the bigger the prick the better the
protection."

"I don't doubt it, Alberto, nor do I want to make it too easy for
you."

"Gooooool!" screamed the TV. "Wait a mo," screamed Alberto. He
was back in a few seconds.
"*Bueno*, give me the prick's full
name and whatever else you got," he said happily. Argentina must
have scored. I nodded to Sara and smiled. She smiled back and
placed her warm hand in mine.

The Wiesenthal Foundation didn't have Kutschmann's prints, so
Wiesenthal had to use his influence to get them from the Nazi
archives in Bonn. The bureaucracy there doesn't give anyone
anything without a court order, which is time-consuming.
Wiesenthal threatened the Justice Minister with complaining to the
press that the government was protecting war criminals, and he got
what he wanted *schnell*! Alberto Contreras used similar tactics
to obtain Pedro Olmo's prints. To no one's surprise, they matched.

"The fucking Germans gotta ask us officially," Alberto told me,
"first to arrest the guy we know as Pedro Olmo, then request
extradition. They know how to do it through the German embassy
here."

They knew how, but they didn\'t do it. Andrea Gutiérrez made sure
that the German embassy in Buenos Aires was informed. They then
had to send all the evidence to Bonn that Walter Kutschmann, aka
Pedro Olmos, wanted by the German Ministry of Justice for war
crimes, had been positively identified. But the German embassy was
without an ambassador at the moment, and the next highest
diplomat, a guy named Werner Graf von Schulenburg, sat on the file
for a week before asking the foreign office in Bonn for
instructions. By the time Bonn answered Kutschmann was long gone,
warned by someone in the German embassy or the Argentine police,
or both. The pressure from his friends in the fascist Argentine
military establishment was too great for Alberto Contrera\'s
superiors.

When it was clear that Kutschmann was gone and the Argentine
authorities had no interest in finding him, I sat with Alberto
Contreras in a café in La Boca and listened to his lament. "That
guy\'s got too many friends in high places, Zorro. Don\'t ask me
why, I don\'t know. I do what I\'m told when this political crap
is involved. They tell me stop, I stop. Sorry."

In case you\'re curious about Andrea Gutiérrez-Romberg and me, our
relationship was intense but brief. I tried to convince her to
stay with me in Argentina, but she was a woman with a mission:
hunting Nazis. And although Argentina was a good hunting ground,
her head office was in Vienna and her heart was in Israel. She
didn\'t have a third leg so our love kindled, flared and, as
absence doesn\'t really make the heart grow fonder, finally burned
itself out.


This story is fiction, but based on facts. Walter Kutschmann was
arrested by the Argentine police in 1975 and later released
because of Germany's delay in requesting his extradition. He
subsequently disappeared, but remained in Argentina. He died of
natural causes in Buenos Aires many years later.
