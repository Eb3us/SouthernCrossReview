# If You Knew

## Ruth Muskrat Bronson

If you could know the empty ache of loneliness,\
          Masked well behind the calm indifferent face\
Of us who pass you by in studied hurriedness,\
          Intent upon our way, lest in the little space\
Of one forgetful moment hungry eyes implore\
          You to be kind, to open up your heart a little more,\
I'm sure you'd smile a little kindlier, sometimes,\
          To those of us you've never seen before.

If you could know the eagerness we'd grasp\
          The hand you'd give to us in friendliness;\
What vast, potential friendship in that clasp\
          We'd press, and love you for your gentleness;\
If you could know the wide, wide reach\
          Of love that simple friendliness could teach,

I'm sure you'd say "Hello, my friend," sometimes, \
          And now and then extend a hand in friendliness to each.

"If You Knew" originally appeared in **University of Oklahoma Magazine
