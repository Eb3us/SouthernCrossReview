## by Billie Holiday

I love my man

I\'m a liar if I say I don\'t.\
I love my man\
I\'m a liar if I say I don\'t.\
But I\'ll quit my man\
I\'m a liar if I say I won\'t.

I\'ve been your slave, baby\
Ever since I\'ve been your babe,\
I\'ve been your slave\
Ever since I\'ve been your babe.\
But before I\'ll be your dog\
I\'ll see you in your grave.

My man wouldn\'t give me no breakfast,\
Wouldn\'t give me no dinner,\
Squawked about my supper then he put me outdoors,\
Had the nerve to lay a matchbox on my clothes.\
I didn\'t have so many,\
But I had a long, long ways to go.\
\
I ain\'t good looking\
And my hair ain\'t curled,\
I ain\'t good looking\
And my hair ain\'t curled.\
But my mother, she gave me something\
It\'s going to carry me through this world.

Some men like me \'cause I\'m happy,\
Some \'cause I\'m snappy,\
Some call me honey,\
Others think I\'ve got money.\
\
Some say to me Billie\
Baby, you\'re built for speed.\
Now, if you put that all together\
Makes me everything a good man needs.
