# Wind

## by Gwendolin Bennet

The wind was a care-free soul  
That broke the chains of earth,  
And strode for a moment across the land  
With the wild halloo of his mirth.  
He little cared that he ripped up trees,  
That houses fell at his hand,  
That his step broke calm on the breast of seas,  
That his feet stirred clouds of sand.

But when he had had his little joke,  
Had shouted and laughed and sung,  
When the trees were scarred, their branches broke,  
And their foliage aching hung,  
He crept to his cave with a stealthy tread,  
With rain-filled eyes and low-bowed head.

“Wind” originally appeared in the 1924 issue of Opportunity: A Journal of Negro Life.
