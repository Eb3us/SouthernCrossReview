<h2>Gwendolin Bennet</h2>

<h3>Wind</h3>
<p>The wind was a care-free soul<br />
That broke the chains of earth,<br />
And strode for a moment across the land<br />
With the wild halloo of his mirth.<br />
He little cared that he ripped up trees,<br />
That houses fell at his hand,<br />
That his step broke calm on the breast of seas,<br />
That his feet stirred clouds of sand.</p>
<p>But when he had had his little joke,<br />
Had shouted and laughed and sung,<br />
When the trees were scarred, their branches broke,<br />
And their foliage aching hung,<br />
He crept to his cave with a stealthy tread,<br />
With rain-filled eyes and low-bowed head.</p>
</div>
<div>
	<h3>Sonnet 1</h3>


<p>He came in silvern armour, trimmed with black—<br />
A lover come from legends long ago—<br />
With silver spurs and silken plumes a-blow,<br />
And flashing sword caught fast and buckled back<br />
In a carven sheath of Tamarack.<br />
He came with footsteps beautifully slow,<br />
And spoke in voice meticulously low.<br />
He came and Romance followed in his track...</p>

<p>I did not ask his name—I thought him Love;<br />
I did not care to see his hidden face.<br />
All life seemed born in my intaken breath;<br />
All thought seemed flown like some forgotten dove.<br />
He bent to kiss and raised his visor's lace...<br />
All eager-lipped I kissed the mouth of Death.</p>
</div>

<div>
	<h3>Sonnet 2</h3>
	
	<p>Some things are very dear to me—<br />
Such things as flowers bathed by rain<br />
Or patterns traced upon the sea<br />
Or crocuses where snow has lain ...<br />
the iridescence of a gem,<br />
The moon’s cool opalescent light,<br />
Azaleas and the scent of them,<br />
And honeysuckles in the night.<br />
And many sounds are also dear—<br />
Like winds that sing among the trees<br />
Or crickets calling from the weir<br />
Or Negroes humming melodies.<br />
But dearer far than all surmise<br />
Are sudden tear-drops in your eyes.</p>
	</p>
</div>
<div>
	<h3>Quatrains</h3>
	<p>1<br />
Brushes and paints are all I have<br />
To speak the music in my soul—<br />
While silently there laughs at me<br />
A copper jar beside a pale green bowl.</p>

	<p>2<br />
How strange that grass should sing—<br />
Grass is so still a thing ...<br />
And strange the swift surprise of snow<br />
So soft it falls and slow.</p>
