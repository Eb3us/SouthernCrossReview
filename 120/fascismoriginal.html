<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">An analogy is haunting the
United States &ndash; the analogy of fascism. It is virtually
impossible (outside certain parts of the Right-wing itself) to try to
understand the resurgent Right without hearing it described as &ndash;
or compared with &ndash; 20th-century interwar fascism. Like fascism,
the resurgent Right is irrational, close-minded, violent and racist.
So goes the analogy, and there&rsquo;s truth to it. But fascism did
not become powerful simply by appealing to citizens&rsquo; darkest
instincts. Fascism also, crucially, spoke to the social and
psychological needs of citizens to be protected from the ravages of
capitalism at a time when other political actors were offering little
help.</p>
<p>The origins of fascism lay in a promise to
protect people. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a rush of
globalisation destroyed communities, professions and cultural norms
while generating a wave of immigration. Right-wing nationalist
movements promising to protect people from the pernicious influence
of foreigners and markets arose, and frightened, disoriented and
displaced people responded. These early fascist movements disrupted
political life in some countries, but they percolated along at a
relatively low simmer until the Second World War.</p><p>The
First World War had devastated Europe, killing 16 million people,
maiming another 20 million, crushing economies and sowing turmoil. In
Italy, for example, the postwar period saw high inflation and
unemployment, as well as strikes, factory occupations, land seizures
and other forms of social unrest and violence. The Liberal Italian
governments of the postwar era failed to adequately address these
problems. The Liberals&rsquo; constituencies &ndash; businessmen,
landowners, members of the middle class &ndash; abandoned them. The
country&rsquo;s two largest opposition parties &ndash; the socialist
PSI and the Catholic PPI &ndash; also offered little effective
redress to these basic social problems.</p><p>Benito
Mussolini and his National Fascist Party (PNF) stepped into the
breach, taking advantage of the failure or ineffectiveness of
existing institutions, parties and elites, and offering  a mixture of
&lsquo;national&rsquo; and &lsquo;social&rsquo; policies. Fascists
promised to foster national unity, prioritise the interests of the
nation above those of any particular group, and promote Italy&rsquo;s
stature internationally. The fascists also appealed to Italians&rsquo;
desire for social security, solidarity and protection from capitalist
crises. They promised therefore to restore order, protect private
property and promote prosperity but also to shield society from
economic downturns and disruption. Fascists stressed that wealth
entailed responsibilities as well as privileges, and should be
administered for the benefits of the nation.</p><p>These
appeals enabled the fascists to garner support from almost all
socioeconomic groups. Italy was a young country (formed in the
1860s), plagued by deep regional and social divisions. By claiming to
serve the best interests of the entire national community, it was in
fact the fascists who became Italy&rsquo;s first true &lsquo;people&rsquo;s
party&rsquo;.</p><p>After coming to power, the Italian
fascists created recreational circles, student and youth groups,
sports and excursion activities. These organisations all furthered
the fascists&rsquo; goals of fostering a truly national community.
The desire to strengthen (a fascist) national identity also compelled
the regime to extraordinary cultural measures. They promoted striking
public architecture, art exhibitions, and film and radio productions.
The regime intervened extensively in the economy. As one fascist put
it: &lsquo;There cannot be any single economic interests which are
above the general economic interests of the state, no individual,
economic initiatives which do not fall under the supervision and
regulation of the state, no relationships of the various classes of
the nation which are not the concern of the state.&rsquo; Such
policies kept fascism popular until the late 1930s, when Mussolini
threw his lot in with Hitler. It was only the country&rsquo;s
involvement in the Second World War, and the Italian regime&rsquo;s
turn to a more overtly &lsquo;racialist&rsquo; understanding of
fascism, that began to make Italian fascism unpopular. </p><p>Italian fascism differed
from its German counterpart in important ways. Most notably, perhaps,
anti-Semitism and racism were more innate in the German version. But
Italian and German fascism also shared important similarities. Like
Italy, Germany was a &lsquo;new&rsquo; nation (formed in 1871)
plagued by deep divisions. After the First World War, Germany had
found itself saddled with punitive peace terms. During the 1920s, it
experienced violent uprisings, political assassinations, foreign
invasion and a notorious Great Inflation. Then the Great Depression
hit, causing immense suffering in Germany. The response of the
government, and other political actors, however, must also be
remembered. For different reasons, both the era&rsquo;s conservative
governments and their socialist opponents primarily favoured
austerity as a response to the crisis. Thus came a golden opportunity
for fascism.</p><p>Hitler&rsquo;s National Socialist
German Workers&rsquo; Party (NSDAP) promised to serve the entire
German people, but the German fascist vision of &lsquo;the people&rsquo;
did not include Jews and other &lsquo;undesirables&rsquo;. They
promised to create a &lsquo;people&rsquo;s community&rsquo;
(<i>Volksgemeinschaft</i>) that would overcome the
country&rsquo;s divisions. The fascists also pledged to fight the
Depression and contrasted its activism on behalf of the people&rsquo;s
welfare with the meekness and austerity of the government and the
socialists. By the 1932 elections, these appeals to protect the
German people helped the Nazis become the largest political party,
and the one with the broadest socioeconomic base.  </p><p>When,
in January 1933, Hitler became chancellor, the Nazis quickly began
work-creation and infrastructure programmes. They exhorted business
to take on workers, and doled out credit. Germany&rsquo;s economy
rebounded and unemployment figures improved dramatically: German
unemployment fell from almost 6 million in early 1933 to 2.4 million
by the end of 1934; by 1938, Germany essentially enjoyed full
employment. By the end of the 1930s, the government was controlling
decisions about economic production, investment, wages and prices.
Public spending was growing spectacularly.</p><p>Nazi
Germany remained capitalist. But it had also undertaken state
intervention in the economy unprecedented in capitalist societies.
The Nazis also supported an extensive welfare state (of course, for
&lsquo;ethnically pure&rsquo; Germans). It included free higher
education, family and child support, pensions, health insurance and
an array of publically supported entertainment and vacation options.
All spheres of life, economy included, had to be subordinated to the
&lsquo;national interest&rsquo; (<i>Gemeinnutz geht vor
Eigennutz</i>), and the fascist commitment to foster social
equality and mobility. Radical meritocratic reforms are not usually
thought of as signature Nazi measures, but, as Hitler once noted, the
Third Reich has &lsquo;opened the way for every qualified individual
&ndash; whatever his origins &ndash; to reach the top if he is
qualified, dynamic, industrious and resolute&rsquo;.</p><p>Largely
for these reasons, up till 1939, most Germans&rsquo; experience with
the Nazi regime was probably positive. The Nazis had seemingly
conquered the Depression and restored economic and political
stability. As long as they could prove their ethnic &lsquo;purity&rsquo;
and stayed away from overt shows of disloyalty, Germans typically
experienced National Socialism not as a tyranny and terror, but as a
regime of social reform and warmth.</p><p>There can be no
question that violence and racism were essential traits of fascism.
But for most Italians, Germans and other European fascists, the
appeal was based not on racism, much less ethnic cleansing, but on
the fascists&rsquo; ability to respond effectively to crises of
capitalism when other political actors were not. Fascists insisted
that states could and should control capitalism, that the state
should and could promote social welfare, and that national
communities needed to be cultivated. The fascist solution ultimately
was, of course, worse than the problem. In response to the horror of
fascism, in part, New Deal Democrats in the United States, and social
democratic parties in Europe, also moved to re-negotiate the social
contract. They promised citizens that they would control capitalism
and provide social welfare policies and undertake other measures to
strengthen national solidarity &ndash; but without the loss of
freedom and democracy that fascism entailed.</p><p>The
lesson for the present is clear: you can&rsquo;t beat something with
nothing. If other political actors don&rsquo;t come up with more
compelling solutions to the problems of capitalism, the popular
appeal of the resurgent Right-wing will continue. And then the
analogy with fascism and democratic collapse of the interwar years
might prove even more relevant than it is now.</p>
