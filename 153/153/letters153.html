<p>RE: <a href="https://southerncrossreview.org/153/fox-boca-mabel.html">Passing
Away in Boca Raton</a> by Frank Thomas Smith</p>
<p>Dear Editors</p>
<p>I must once again protest the publication of these highly inflammable
detective stories involving Roberto Fox. It would seem that beautiful
women and hotel rooms are all this master agent can muster on his trips
abroad.</p>
<p>My husband of 33 years who suffers from an acute form of absolute
truth has had to have his dosage of anti-depressants increased twice
since your publication landed on our door step last Friday. He has also
asked his pharmacist for samples of Viagra!</p>
<p>It is, I am sure, just a coincidence that like your fictitious
expatriate, ex-FBI, ex-Brooklynite, x-rated womanizing detective, that
my husband’s mother is also retired in Florida. She is a dodo-bird of a
person who has had her dead poodle, Pierre, stuffed and last month
changed her will to have all her assets left to the Sarasota chapter of
the ASPCA.</p>
<p>With all these things going on in my life, I cannot afford the time
to keep fighting off my husband’s sexual advances each time he reads one
of these inflammatory tales and then runs to the nearest drug store!</p>
<p>Would you please just solve the crime or the mystery and leave out
mentioning long legs and women being tossed on beds and kissing at the
Holiday Inn. You should know that my husband has booked a room at our
local Holiday Inn for three nights!</p>
<p>On the brighter side, my mother-in-law has left us the stuffed
dog.</p>
<p>Insipidity</p>

<p>Good day,</p>
<p>I loved this story! The author took me into the world of Kit
Covington. As a woman and as an artist, I completely identified with the
main character. The writing was visual and emotional. Thank you for
publishing. I look forward to reading more by this writer.</p>

<p>RE: <a href="https://southerncrossreview.org/153/jfk-review.html">JFK
– and the Unspeakable</a></p>
<p>Frank -</p>
<p>While reading your review of JFK and the Unspeakable, I thought that
you were softening it and expressing doubts, and I wondered why, who it
was for whom you needed to soften it and express doubts. The
assassinations of John and Robert Kennedy were intricately planned and
brought about by the CIA (this has been confirmed in multiple
congressional investigations and by some remarkable admissions by CIA
agents themselves, as well as CIA documents that have been released -
though these are for some reason not well publicized), and very likely
the assassinations of Martin Luther King and Malcolm X as well (the FBI
may have taken the lead in the latter two). The mob may well have had a
substantial role also, as the CIA was actively working with the mob at
that time, to overthrow Castro, and cooperated with the CIA in several
unsuccessful assassination attempts on Castro himself. And <em>multiple
more murders </em>were committed in the cover-up of these
assassinations, especially the JFK one.</p>
<p>There is no doubt much more to be learned from the hundreds of
documents not yet released by the CIA. In fact, the CIA was
assassinating (or attempting to) a number of foreign heads of state of
whom they disapproved, from Mossadegh in Iran (and we wonder why they
call us “the Great Satan!) to Lumumba, Sukarno, Diem in Viet Nam, and
others in South America and Africa, particularly. If they could not
assassinate, they brought about a dozen coups (e.g. Allende/Pinochet).
The Kennedy assassination was apparently the first time they turned
their assassination attention and practice to operate on a domestic
front – as far as we know. Criminals they were already; at that point
they became traitors.</p>
<p>I think there is no reasonable doubt about the role of the CIA in the
murders of the Kennedys, and that the campaign for president of RFK Jr
may likely put him in grave danger as well (he is not unaware of it).
The most chilling thing about all this, perhaps, is the realization that
these same people or this same element is still in power in our
government, and that no president has dared to take them on since
Kennedy. And no president has dared question wars and weapons sales, and
to work seriously for peace. RFK Jr. is not just a breath of fresh air
(he talks publicly as if he were talking to me, not as a politician
talks); he is a provider of oxygen to a U. S. democracy on life support
and suffocating.</p>
<p>That book makes a lot of things very clear. I think every voter in
the U.S. needs to read it, but of course they won’t. It is hard reading
and is relentless, and we Americans apparently don’t want to know such
things, and are walking in our sleep.</p>
<p>Michael Hall</p>
<p>PS - I’m enjoying much of the writing in your review. Thank you.</p>

<p>RE: <a
href="https://southerncrossreview.org/153/kennedy-deadly-immunity.html">Deadly
Immunity</a> by Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</p>
<p>Hi, Frank. I'm saddened that this article has given the man yet
another platform to distribute claims that are not backed by data but by
conspiracy. Democracy is being chipped away, piece by piece, by
conspiracies, disinformation and consequent lack of trust.</p>
<p>An article of this sort should be accompanied by evidence and data,
lots of it, with footnotes pointing to reliable and authoritative
sources providing the papers and analyses behind it.</p>
<p>Can I prove he's wrong? Of course not. Then again, he can't prove I'm
wrong if I say there is a teapot orbiting the sun between Earth and
Mars.</p>
<p>In the below article there are links to the following claims made by
RFK Jr:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Wi-Fi causes cancer and "leaky brain," Kennedy told podcaster Joe
Rogan last month<br />

<li><p>Antidepressants are to blame for school shootings, he mused
during an appearance with Twitter CEO Elon Musk<br />

<li><p>Chemicals in the water supply could turn children transgender, he
told right-wing Canadian psychologist and podcaster Jordan Peterson,
echoing a false assertion made by serial fabulist Alex Jones<br />

<p>Dear Frank,</p>
<p>This is so important! And his July 2023 podcast link as well. I am so
grateful to Kennedy for opposing the compulsory Covid vaccinations!
IMHO, rejecting this experimental mRNA gene-therapy was a global test
for mankind, whether our level of consciousness reached the desired
Consciousness Soul level (the period of which started in 1413).</p>
<p>So thank you for publishing this! Cheers,</p>
<p>Norbert Hanny</p>

<p>Robert F Kennedy (Jr.) is wrong. His bogus claims have been disproven
by countless studies, including a few that were contemporary with this
article. You should publish a review of some of those.</p>

<p>It is quite unbelievable that the medical ethics of federal bodies
could stoop as low as this. We expect doctors to be utterly moral.

<p>Hi Frank</p>
<p>Honestly, I quite enjoy some of the thoughtful,  unusual, literary,
and esoteric stories and other items that find their way into your SC
review, but my comment in this case is that I think it’s irresponsible
of you to publish this conspiracy theorist anti-vaxxer rubbish. </p>
<p>If you read the piece critically, you see that it has all hallmarks
of conspiracy literature: no actual verifiable scientific proof, instead
“secret” (unpublished, unverified, unreferenced) research, a long
diatribe of explanation with numerous mentions of august bodies and
dates to make it seem impressive, secret meetings where recording and
photocopying were prohibited (ergo no proof), scientific inaccuracies
(confusion of thimerosal with ethyl mercury, for example). </p>
<p>Kennedy himself has had three family members speak up, publicly
repudiating his approach. His uncle, when president of the USA,
instigated large-scale vaccination programs, saving thousands of lives
in the 1960s. The article fails to mention these balancing facts. </p>
<p>No evidence is  presented to support the unfounded allegations that
US government bodies helped drug companies get rid of stocks of
so-called toxic vaccines. </p>
<p>The article takes a polemical approach, with no journalistic
presentation of the opposite side of the story, which would enable the
reader can make a more informed opinion. </p>
<p>I wouldn’t care about any of this, except that when people (eg
SCReview) continue to publish this type of material, it contributes to
the general sense of separation and anxiety that is in the rise as a
result of the accelerating pace of change in our civilization (caused,
in my opinion, by the increase in population, combined with the hyper
connectivity that new comms technologies have provided - but note, this
is a mere intuition,  and I have no evidence ?). </p>
<p>By increasing people’s anxiety, this kind of writing also contributes
to the slow erosion of confidence in a proven, validated, and important
public health measure: vaccination  </p>
<p>This results in increased numbers of parents failing to vaccinate
their children, which reduces the herd immunity effect, and results in
unnecessary sickness and death in innocent children. As an example,
explained in straightforward terms, see this recent reportage:  <a
href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewbinnicker/2023/06/28/measles-once-an-afterthought-in-the-us-is-making-a-comeback/?sh=64d602f34bcd"
class="uri">https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewbinnicker/2023/06/28/measles-once-an-afterthought-in-the-us-is-making-a-comeback/?sh=64d602f34bcd</a></p>
<p>If you really want to publish stuff like this, at least consider
publishing the other side of the argument as well. </p>
<p>On the other hand, if you are a confirmed anti-vaccination person
yourself, and thereby committed to ignoring or dismissing the great
weight of scientific evidence as a conspiracy by governments/
corporations/ George Soros / Bill Gates / Illuminati/ whatever, then
please let me know so I don’t waste any more of your and my valuable
time. </p>
<p>These three pieces might also be worth your while to look at:</p>

<p>Thank you for your consideration. And otherwise please keep the
stories, literature, and esoteric articles coming. </p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
