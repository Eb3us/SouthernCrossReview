<p class="MsoPlainText"><b><span lang="EN-US">Author�s note</SPAN></B><span lang="EN-US">: This article was originally published in <i>Interavia, </I>a
leading Geneva based aviation trade magazine, in May 1975. At the time, the
international airlines met regularly to set fares, conditions of travel and
practically all elements of international air transportation. This was done
within their trade organization, the International Air Transport Association
(IATA). Fare setting was possible because IATA had been granted exemption from
anti-trust laws. If this sounds unusual today, it did not seem strange then,
because air transportation was still considered to be a public service and
therefore needful of special government protection. A few years after the
article was published, however, the U.S. government rescinded the anti-trust
exemption and most other governments were eventually forced to follow suit.
</SPAN></P>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US">The result, �open skies�, resulted in a
savage dog-eat-dog competition, finally culminating in the bankruptcy and
disappearance of many airlines � most of them United States flag carriers. To
name a few: Panam, Panagra, TWA, Eastern, Braniff. Most non-U.S. carriers were
government owned and/or protected, and better able to survive, although even
state owned Latin American airlines succumbed: Viasa, Aeroperu, Varig
(recently), etc. In Europe Sabena, and even I was surprised when Swissair,
arguably the best airline of all, disappeared. Airline travelers who are old enough to remember will not have to be told about the sharp decline in passenger service, the increase in delays, missed connections, etc., despite much improved technology.</SPAN></P>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US">I cannot say I foresaw the totality of
the disaster, but I did think that the anti-trust immunity could not last
(there were already rumblings about it), so I wrote the following article. As
an employee of IATA, I was contractually obliged to submit the article to top
management for approval. The Director General at the time, Knut Hammarskjold,
who apparently personally agreed with the sentiments expressed, finally
agreed, but with the proviso that it not appear under my name. (IATA could not
appear to be endorsing a concept with the airlines themselves would probably
not accept.) Therefore it appeared as having been written by �Francis Tate�,
without the usual bio.</SPAN></P>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US">I am not republishing the article now
in order to say �I told you so�, but merely to suggest that the �Associative
Principle� is still valid, not only for the airline industry, but for industry
in general.</SPAN></P>

<p class="MsoPlainText" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><b><span lang="EN-US">Almost
overnight</SPAN></B><span lang="EN-US">, consumerism has become a household word
integrated into vocabularies of the world's languages. The consumer has become
aware of his rights and of the influence which he is in a position lo exert on
the economic process trough concerted action. In the air transport field the
consumer-passengers have begun to organize and demand their rights � even to
the extent of over-reaction in the form of emotionalism, headline-hunting and
court actions against airlines, travel agencies and even governmental
regulatory bodies. The airlines and, to a lesser extent, the travel agents,
who have had things their own way for a long time, are beginning to realize
that it takes three to tango in economic enterprises: producers, distributors
and consumers.</SPAN></P>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"></SPAN>&nbsp;</P>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b><span lang="EN-US">Trade associations</SPAN></B></P>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"></SPAN>&nbsp;</P>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span lang="EN-US">The producer-airlines have long had their own trade associations,
principally the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and the US
domestic Air Transport Association (ATA), while other regional associations
have more recently appeared on the scene. These are unique organizations
within which, at least in the case of IATA, member airlines are allowed to
meet regularly and openly fix fares, cargo rates and other conditions of
transportation in spite of strict anti-trust laws. The explanation for this
extraordinary situation is that governments recognize the importance of the
public service nature of air transport, as well as the great complexity of the
international relations which are involved in its make-up. The individual
states, even those which own their national carriers outright, are obliged to
concede the indispensability of these associations because they are aware that
their own bureaucratic nature prevents them from performing the functions of
an IATA themselves. Most are conscious of the fact that if there were no IATA,
the political states would have to take over its functions, and the ensuing
chaos is eminently predictable.</SPAN></P>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span lang="EN-US">The distributor-travel agents also have their trade associations on
a local, regional and international level. It is only recently however, that a
spirit of cooperation has become visible in the relations between the
international airline and agent bodies. The airlines fear that organized
agents might eventually succeed in squeezing more and / or unreasonable
commissions out of their already bleeding pocketbooks. On the other side there
has been considerable resentment amongst agents, who have felt that the
airlines have been acting arbitrarily in refusing even to discuss this point
seriously with them. The situation has evolved however, to the point where
IATA and UFTAA (Universal Federation of Travel Agents Associations) are having
regular contacts and where even the president of UFTAA, P. Bamberger, has
expressed "high hopes and beliefs" that acceptable solutions will be found to
differences between the two organizations. In a recent meeting of the IATA
Industry Policy Committee, chaired by IATA's Director General, Knut
Hammarskjold, member airlines finally decided to meet the commission question
head-on, by recommending that their Traffic Committee continue discussions
with travel agency organizations with a view to coming to an agreement
concerning commissions as well as other outstanding airline-agency questions
such as joint market development, cooperative advertising, wholesaler
compensation and even compliance, which has long been an irritating factor.
The Policy Committee went so far as to say that in its opinion "the Traffic
Committee should consider any short-term solution in relation to a long-term
policy...".</SPAN></P>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the differences are resolved
however, or even before, it will be necessary to <i>work together</I>-not to
merely stop fighting. An outstanding example of what can be achieved through
cooperation is the IATA/UFTAA jointly sponsored Agents' Professional Training
Course which, as it gradually expands over the globe, is greatly increasing
the degree of professionalism in the travel industry. These beginnings are to
be applauded, but much more is needed for the development of a truly rational
air transport policy: the third corner of the triangle is empty and the
consumer-passengers are still on the outside looking in.</SPAN></P>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"></SPAN>&nbsp;</P>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b><span lang="EN-US">What about the
Consumer?</SPAN></B></P>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"></SPAN>&nbsp;</P>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the basic principles of
economic enterprise - the Associative Principle - is mostly overlooked and
only partially practiced in certain public service industries, although
conditions make it so clearly appropriate that one wonders why those
responsible are not more conscious of it. Perhaps, as is so often the case,
because it is so obvious.</SPAN></P>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Associative Principle is based
upon another, largely unrealized fact of life: that work is essentially of a
fraternal nature. This can be clearly seen, as an example, at a modern
assembly line, where the division of labour has been carried to such an
extreme that the workers have become, in a sense, its victims. Each worker
usually performs one or few actions which, together with many other sim ilar
actions by other workers, eventually results in a finished product, whether it
be a pair of shoes, a suit, an automobile or an aircraft. Other contributors
to the production of the end-product are the designer, the engineer, manager,
clerical workers and so on. The answer to the question: For whom did they
produce the aircraft or the shoes? is: not for themselves, but for others.
This working for others is a fraternal process, be it conscious or not, and
these "others" have acquired a specific designation in economic terminology:
consumers.</SPAN></P>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fraternal nature of the air
transport industry is often expressed differently. It is called a public
service industry, which it certainly is, and this public service consists of
providing safe, regular and economic air transportation to the public, that
is, to "others". If we recognize that the reason we occupy ourselves with
selling air tickets or servicing aircraft or flying them or writing about all
these things, is to serve the needs of the consumer-passengers, then we must
look for a method of performing this activity which is not only the most
efficient, but which also corresponds to the fraternal nature of the activity.
The appropriate method is the Associative Method, a phenomenon which has
already appeared on the horizon, but which is not yet clearly
recognized.</SPAN></P>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"></SPAN>&nbsp;</P>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b><span lang="EN-US">The principle</SPAN></B></P>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"></SPAN>&nbsp;</P>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the
air transport industry we have:</SPAN></P>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.
airline associations;</SPAN></P>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.
travel agents' associations;</SPAN></P>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.
Passengers� associations (consumer groups).</SPAN></P>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</SPAN></P>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="TEXT-INDENT: 35.4pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span lang="EN-US">The Associative Principle indicates that the producers, the
distributers and the consumers, the three groups directly involved in any
economic process, should associate in order to arrive at the solutions to
their common problems. Each is equally important and should have an equal
voice in the decision-making process. (Efforts to "eliminate the middle man"
in order to bring prices down are sheer nonsense. The middlemen perform a
function which in fact causes prices to be lower in the long run than they
otherwise would be, since neither the producer nor the consumer can
consistently perform it as efficiently as they can).</SPAN></P>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Presently, with the exception of the
example cited above, the three types of associations are generally engaged in
fighting <i>against</I> each other in egotistic self-interest, instead of
cooperating <i>with</I> each other for the benefit of the common interest. As
separate, unassociated (with each other) groups, this is the type of conduct
which must be expected from them. No passenger, as things stand, when the
airlines offer him a fare of 100 dollars is likely to object, "No, that is too
little for your needs, After all, you must pay off the debt incurred because
of these new aircraft you bought, not to mention agents' commissions, landing
fees, navigation fees, excessive fuel prices, inflation and God only knows
what else. I will pay 120 dollars". This is perhaps a grotesque example.
Nevertheless, in integrated associations all three sides will be able to
survey the overall picture and work together for what their new insight will
show them to be the best possible course of action, even though one group's
immediate profit may be sacrificed. The common interest will be seen as the
essential element in the decision making process.</SPAN></P>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The general, but not absolute,
tendency of airlines as producers of air transportation, like all producers,
is to favour higher prices. (In the case of the non-scheduled charter
operators which have opted for lower prices, we have a situation in which
these carriers have taken advantage of the fact that the scheduled airlines
were already performing the real public service of operating regularly
scheduled flights, and the undercutting of fares was possible only because
they themselves were not required to perform this service.) The passengers
tend to favour lower prices and the travel agent is in the middle, knowing
that low fares enable him to sell more, but realizing at the same time that
the higher the fare, the larger his commission will be. He would therefore
tend to assume the mediator's role on the fares question in an association
comprised of the representatives of the three groups.</SPAN></P>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span lang="EN-US">The
passenger would assume the mediating role in such questions as agency
commissions and productivity norms, and the airlines would take it over when
such problems as inclusive tour services, credit arrangements, cargo agents'
disbursement fees, etc., are discussed.</SPAN></P>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"></SPAN>&nbsp;</P>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b><span lang="EN-US">Ideally...</SPAN></B></P>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"></SPAN>&nbsp;</P>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Human reason</I> could make its
debut. For instance, no knowledgeable passenger representative would demand a
fare which is economically unviable if he is present at the moment of decision
on what the fare should be and participates in that decision, instead of
merely being informed of the fare he must pay after it has been unilaterally
decided upon by the airlines. In the open and fraternal atmosphere of an
integrated association, each group's demands would be agreed to only to the
extent they are justifiable and are seen to contribute to the mutual benefit
of all concerned.</SPAN></P>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It should be noted that once the
consumer-passengers are in a position to represent their own interests as
members of integrated associations, it will no longer be necessary for
political states to act as defenders of their interests. Therefore, an
extremely important side-effect of the Associative Method is the reduction of
governmental influence and interference in what is essentially an economic and
not a political enterprise.</SPAN></P>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The necessary elements for the
realization of the Associative Principle are already with us in the form of
separate associations of airlines, travel agents and passengers. When these
three basic groups form <i>integrated</I> associations, then a giant stride
toward a healthy air transport industry will have been taken.</SPAN></P>
