<h3>Oppenheimer and the Birth of the Nuclear-Industrial Complex</h3>

</header>

<main>
<p class="intro">Unless you’ve been hiding under a rock for the past few months,
you’re undoubtedly aware that award-winning director Christopher Nolan
has released a <a
href="https://gregmitchell.substack.com/p/notes-on-seeing-oppenheimer">new
film</a> about Robert Oppenheimer, known as the “father of the atomic
bomb” for leading the group of scientists who created that deadly weapon
as part of America’s World War II-era Manhattan Project. The film has
earned widespread attention, with large numbers of people participating
in what’s already become known as “<a
href="https://www.business-standard.com/world-news/what-is-barbieheimer-the-viral-trend-that-is-taking-the-internet-by-storm-123071700298_1.html">Barbieheimer</a>”
by seeing Greta Gerwig’s hit film <em>Barbie</em> and Nolan’s
three-hour-long <em>Oppenheimer</em> on the same day.</p>
<p>Nolan’s film is a distinctive pop cultural phenomenon because it
deals with the American use of nuclear weapons, a genuine rarity since
ABC’s 1983 airing of <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/20/arts/tv-view-the-day-after-tv-as-a-rallying-cry.html"><em>The
Day After</em></a> about the consequences of nuclear war. (An
earlier exception was Stanley Kubrick’s <a
href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/almost-everything-in-dr-strangelove-was-true"><em>Dr.
Strangelove</em></a>, his satirical portrayal of the insanity of the
Cold War nuclear arms race.)</p>
<p><span id="anchor"></span>The film is based on <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0375726268/ref=nosim/?tag=tomdispatch-20"><em>American
Prometheus</em></a>, the <a
href="https://www.pulitzer.org/winners/kai-bird-and-martin-j-sherwin">Pulitzer
Prize-winning</a> 2005 biography of Oppenheimer by Kai Bird and Martin
Sherwin. Nolan made it in part to break through the shield of antiseptic
rhetoric, bloodless philosophizing, and public complacency that has
allowed such world-ending weaponry to persist so long after <a
href="https://thebulletin.org/virtual-tour/trinity-the-first-nuclear-bomb-test/">Trinity</a>,
the first nuclear bomb test, was conducted in the New Mexico desert 78
years ago this month.</p>
<p>Nolan’s impetus was <a
href="https://thebulletin.org/premium/2023-07/an-extended-interview-with-christopher-nolan-director-of-oppenheimer/#post-heading">rooted</a>
in his early exposure to the nuclear disarmament movement in Europe. As
he said recently:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It’s something that’s been on my radar for a number of years. I was
a teenager in the ‘80s, the early ’80s in England. It was the peak of
CND, Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, the Greenham Common [protest];
the threat of nuclear war was when I was 12, 13, 14 — it was the biggest
fear we all had. I think I first encountered Oppenheimer in… Sting’s
song about the Russians that came out then and talks about Oppenheimer’s
’deadly toys.’”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A feature film on the genesis of nuclear weapons may not strike you
as an obvious candidate for box-office blockbuster status. As Nolan’s
teenage son <a
href="https://thebulletin.org/premium/2023-07/an-extended-interview-with-christopher-nolan-director-of-oppenheimer/#post-heading">said</a>
when his father told him he was thinking about making such a film,
“Well, nobody really worries about nuclear weapons anymore. Are people
going to be interested in that?” Nolan responded that, given what’s at
stake, he <a
href="https://thebulletin.org/premium/2023-07/an-extended-interview-with-christopher-nolan-director-of-oppenheimer/#post-heading">worries</a>
about complacency and even denial when it comes to the global risks
posed by the nuclear arsenals on this planet. “You’re normalizing
killing tens of thousands of people. You’re creating moral equivalences,
false equivalences with other types of conflict… [and so] accepting,
normalizing… the danger.”</p>
<p>These days, unfortunately, you’re talking about anything but just
tens of thousands of people dying in a nuclear face-off. A 2022 <a
href="https://www.ippnw.org/programs/nuclear-weapons-abolition/nuclear-famine-climate-effects-of-regional-nuclear-war">report</a>
by Ira Helfand and International Physicians for the Prevention of
Nuclear War estimated that a “limited” nuclear war between India and
Pakistan that used roughly 3% of the world’s <a
href="https://fas.org/initiative/status-world-nuclear-forces/">12,000-plus</a> nuclear
warheads would kill “hundreds of millions, perhaps even billions” of us.
A full-scale nuclear war between the United States and Russia, the study
suggests, could kill up to five (yes, five!) billion people within two
years, essentially ending life as we know it on this planet in a “<a
href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-022-00573-0">nuclear
winter</a>.”</p>
<p>Obviously, all too many of us don’t grasp the stakes involved in a
nuclear conflict, thanks in part to “<a
href="https://publicseminar.org/essays/warning-from-ukraine/">psychic
numbing</a>,” a concept regularly invoked by Robert Jay Lifton, author
of <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0380727641/ref=nosim/?tag=tomdispatch-20"><em>Hiroshima
in America: A History of Denial</em></a> (co-authored with Greg
Mitchell), among many other books. Lifton <a
href="https://publicseminar.org/essays/warning-from-ukraine/">describes</a>
psychic numbing as “a diminished capacity or inclination to feel”
prompted by “the completely unprecedented dimension of this revolution
in technological destructiveness.”</p>
<p>Given the Nolan film’s focus on Oppenheimer’s story, some crucial
issues related to the world’s nuclear dilemma are either dealt with only
briefly or omitted altogether.</p>

<p>The <a
href="https://thebulletin.org/2020/08/counting-the-dead-at-hiroshima-and-nagasaki/">staggering
devastation</a> caused by the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki is
suggested only indirectly without any striking visual evidence of the
devastating human consequences of the use of those two weapons. Also
largely ignored are the critical voices who then argued that there was
no need to drop a bomb, no less two of them, on a Japan most of whose
cities had already been devastated by U.S. fire-bombing to end the war.
General (and later President) Dwight D. Eisenhower <a
href="https://substack.com/inbox/post/135322826">wrote</a> that when he
was told by Secretary of War Henry Stimson of the plan to drop atomic
bombs on populated areas in Japan, “I voiced to him my grave misgivings,
first on the basis of my belief that Japan was already defeated and that
dropping the bomb was completely unnecessary.”</p>
<p>The film also fails to address the health <a
href="https://www.wpsr.org/why-we-work-on-nuclear-weapons">impacts</a>
of the research, testing, and production of such weaponry, which to this
day is <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/20/science/trinity-nuclear-test-atomic-bomb-oppenheimer.html">still
causing</a> disease and death, even without another nuclear weapon ever
being used in war. Victims of nuclear weapons development include people
who were impacted by the fallout from U.S. nuclear testing in the
Western United States and the <a
href="https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2022-11/news/us-marshall-islands-grapple-nuclear-legacy">Marshall
Islands</a> in the Western Pacific, <a
href="https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/handle/1773/25190?show=full">uranium
miners</a> on Navajo lands, and many others. Speaking of the first
nuclear test in Los Alamos, New Mexico, Tina Cordova of the <a
href="https://www.trinitydownwinders.com/">Tularosa Basin Downwinders
Consortium</a>, which represents that state’s residents who suffered
widespread cancers and high rates of infant mortality caused by
radiation from that explosion, <a
href="https://responsiblestatecraft.org/2023/07/21/what-oppenheimer-leaves-out/">said</a>
“It’s an inconvenient truth… People just don’t want to reflect on the
fact that American citizens were bombed at Trinity.”</p>
<p>Another crucially important issue has received almost no attention.
Neither the film nor the discussion sparked by it has explored one of
the most important reasons for the continued existence of nuclear
weapons — the profits it yields the participants in America’s massive
nuclear-industrial complex.</p>
<p>Once Oppenheimer and other concerned scientists and policymakers <a
href="https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2005_07-08/Kuznick">failed</a> to
convince the Truman administration to simply close Los Alamos and place
nuclear weapons and the materials needed to develop them under
international control — the only way, as they saw it, to head off a
nuclear arms race with the Soviet Union — the drive to expand the
nuclear weapons complex was on. Research and production of nuclear
warheads and nuclear-armed bombers, missiles, and submarines quickly
became a big business, whose beneficiaries have worked doggedly to limit
any efforts at the reduction or elimination of nuclear arms.</p>
<h4>The Manhattan Project and the Birth of the Nuclear-Industrial Complex</h4>
<p>The <a
href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Manhattan-Project">Manhattan
Project</a> Oppenheimer directed was one of the largest public works
efforts ever undertaken in American history. Though the
<em>Oppenheimer </em>film focuses on Los Alamos, it quickly came
to include far-flung facilities across the United States. At its peak,
the project would employ <a
href="https://www.energy.gov/lm/manhattan-project-background-information-and-preservation-work">130,000
workers</a> — as many as in the entire U.S. auto industry at the
time.</p>
<p>According to nuclear expert Stephen Schwartz, author of<a
href="https://www.brookings.edu/books/atomic-audit/"></a><a
href="https://www.brookings.edu/books/atomic-audit/"><em>Atomic
Audit</em></a>, the seminal work on the financing of U.S. nuclear
weapons programs, through the end of 1945 the Manhattan Project cost <a
href="https://twitter.com/AtomicAnalyst/status/1683546295279951897?s=20">nearly
$38 billion</a> in today’s dollars, while helping spawn an enterprise
that has since cost taxpayers an almost unimaginable <a
href="https://twitter.com/AtomicAnalyst/status/1674806938683551745?s=20"><em>$12
trillion</em></a><em> </em>for nuclear weapons and related
programs. And the costs never end. The Nobel prize-winning International
Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN) reports that the U.S. spent
<a
href="https://www.icanw.org/wasted_2022_global_nuclear_weapons_spending">$43.7
billion</a> on nuclear weapons last year alone, and a new Congressional
Budget Office report suggests that another <a
href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/59054#:~:text=CBO%20estimates%20that%20plans%20for,for%20the%202021–2030%20period.">$756
billion</a> will go into those deadly armaments in the next decade.</p>
<p>Private contractors now run the nuclear warhead complex and build
nuclear delivery vehicles. They <a
href="https://www.dontbankonthebomb.com/nuclear-weapon-producers/">range</a>
from Raytheon, General Dynamics, and Lockheed Martin to lesser-known
firms like BWX Technologies and Jacobs Engineering, all of which split
billions of dollars in contracts from the Pentagon (for the production
of nuclear delivery vehicles) and the Department of Energy (for nuclear
warheads). To keep the gravy train running — ideally, in perpetuity —
those contractors also spend <a
href="https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2021-05/features/inside-icbm-lobby-special-interests-national-interest">millions</a>
lobbying decision-makers. Even universities have gotten into the act.
Both the University of California and Texas A&amp;M are part of the <a
href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/u-of-california-and-texas-a-m-win-bid-to-run-birthplace-of-atom-bomb/#:~:text=of%20California%20and%20Texas%20A%26M%20U.,run%20Los%20Alamos%20National%20Laboratory.">consortium</a>
that runs the Los Alamos nuclear weapons laboratory.</p>
<p>The American warhead complex is a <a
href="https://3ba8a190-62da-4c98-86d2-893079d87083.usrfiles.com/ugd/3ba8a1_3ad999bcc8ff4a289f985db52bb88196.pdf">vast
enterprise</a> with major facilities in California, Missouri, Nevada,
New Mexico, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas. And nuclear-armed <a
href="https://3ba8a190-62da-4c98-86d2-893079d87083.usrfiles.com/ugd/3ba8a1_3ad999bcc8ff4a289f985db52bb88196.pdf">submarines</a>,
<a
href="https://www.northropgrumman.com/what-we-do/air/b-21-raider/10-facts-about-northrop-grummans-b-21-raider/">bombers</a>,
and <a
href="https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2021-05/features/inside-icbm-lobby-special-interests-national-interest">missiles</a>
are produced or based in California, Connecticut, Georgia, Louisiana,
North Dakota, Montana, Virginia, Washington state, and Wyoming. Add in
nuclear subcontractors and most states host at least some
nuclear-weapons-related activities.</p>
<p>And such beneficiaries of the nuclear weapons industry are far from
silent when it comes to debating the future of nuclear spending and
policy-making.</p>
<h4>Profiteers of Armageddon: The Nuclear Weapons Lobby</h4>
<p>The institutions and companies that build nuclear bombs, missiles,
aircraft, and submarines, along with their allies in Congress, have
played a disproportionate role in shaping U.S. nuclear policy and
spending. They have typically <a
href="https://carnegieendowment.org/2009/11/03/why-we-don-t-need-to-resume-nuclear-testing-reply-to-senator-jon-kyl-s-why-we-need-to-test-nuclear-weapons-pub-24079">opposed</a>
the U.S. ratification of a Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban treaty; put <a
href="https://3ba8a190-62da-4c98-86d2-893079d87083.usrfiles.com/ugd/3ba8a1_89fe183f8a164e22a2fa29d4d6381d7b.pdf">strict
limits</a> on the ability of Congress to reduce either funding for or the
deployment of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs); and <a
href="https://www.defensenews.com/congress/budget/2023/06/22/gop-moves-to-instate-sea-launched-cruise-missile-nuclear-program/">pushed</a>
for weaponry like a proposed nuclear-armed, sea-launched cruise missile
that even the Pentagon hasn’t requested, while <a
href="https://3ba8a190-62da-4c98-86d2-893079d87083.usrfiles.com/ugd/3ba8a1_c7e3bfc7723d4021b54cbc145ae3f5eb.pdf">funding
think tanks</a> that promote an ever more robust nuclear weapons
force.</p>
<p>A case in point is the <a
href="https://responsiblestatecraft.org/2021/05/26/meet-the-senate-nuke-caucus-busting-the-budget-and-making-the-world-less-safe/">Senate
ICBM Coalition</a> (dubbed part of the “<a
href="https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Foreign-Policy/2010/1222/New-START-treaty-How-will-next-efforts-for-nuclear-weapons-reduction-fare">Dr. Strangelove
Caucus</a>” by Arms Control Association Director Daryl Kimball and other
critics of nuclear arms). The ICBM Coalition <a
href="https://3ba8a190-62da-4c98-86d2-893079d87083.usrfiles.com/ugd/3ba8a1_89fe183f8a164e22a2fa29d4d6381d7b.pdf">consists
of</a> senators from states with major ICBM bases or ICBM research,
maintenance, and production sites: Montana, North Dakota, Utah, and
Wyoming. The sole Democrat in the group, Jon Tester (D-MT), is the <a
href="https://www.tester.senate.gov/about/issues/national-security-military/">chair</a>
of the powerful appropriations subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations
Committee, where he can keep an eye on ICBM spending and advocate for it
as needed.</p>
<p>The Senate ICBM Coalition is responsible for numerous measures aimed
at protecting both the funding and deployment of such deadly missiles.
<a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/30/opinion/why-its-safe-to-scrap-americas-icbms.html">According
to</a> former Secretary of Defense William Perry, they are among “the
most dangerous weapons we have” because a president, if warned of a
possible nuclear attack on this country, would have just minutes to
decide to launch them, risking a nuclear conflict based on a false
alarm. That Coalition’s efforts are supplemented by persistent lobbying
from a series of <a
href="https://thebulletin.org/2020/10/nuclear-disarmers-cant-forget-the-communities-that-rely-on-military-spending/">local
coalitions</a> of business and political leaders in those ICBM states.
Most of them work closely with Northrop Grumman, the prime contractor
for the new ICBM, dubbed the Sentinel and expected to <a
href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-03/new-u-s-icbms-could-cost-up-to-264-billion-over-decades?in_source=embedded-checkout-banner">cost</a>
at least $264 billion to develop, build, and maintain over its life span
that is expected to exceed 60 years.</p>
<p>Of course, Northrop Grumman and its <a
href="https://www.defenseone.com/business/2019/09/northrop-icbm/159886/">12
major ICBM subcontractors</a> have been busy pushing the Sentinel as
well. They spend <a
href="https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/indus.php?Ind=D">tens of
millions of dollars</a> on campaign contributions and lobbying annually,
while <a
href="https://www.pogo.org/report/2018/11/brass-parachutes">employing</a>
former members of the government’s nuclear establishment to make their
case to Congress and the executive branch. And those are hardly the only
organizations or networks devoted to sustaining the nuclear arms race.
You would have to include the <a href="https://www.afa.org/">Air Force
Association</a> and the obscurely named <a
href="https://submarinesuppliers.org/">Submarine Industrial Base
Council</a>, among others.</p>
<p>The biggest point of leverage the nuclear weapons industry and the
arms sector more broadly have over Congress is jobs. How strange then
that the arms industry has generated diminishing job returns since the
end of the Cold War. According to the National Defense Industrial
Association, direct employment in the weapons industry has <a
href="https://www.ndia.org/about/press/press-releases/2020/2/5/vitalsigns">dropped</a>
from 3.2 million in the mid-1980s to about 1.1 million today.</p>
<p>Even a relatively small slice of the Pentagon and Department of
Energy nuclear budgets could create <a
href="https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/files/cow/imce/papers/2023/One-pager%20on%20Heidi%27s%20paper-3.pdf">many
more jobs</a> if invested in green energy, sustainable infrastructure,
education, or public health – anywhere from 9% to 250% more jobs,
depending on the amount spent. Given that the climate crisis is already
well underway, such a shift would not only make this country more
prosperous but the world safer by slowing the pace of climate-driven
catastrophes and offering at least some protection against its worst
manifestations.</p>
<h4>A New Nuclear Reckoning?</h4>
<p>Count on one thing: by itself, a movie focused on the origin of
nuclear weapons, no matter how powerful, won’t force a new reckoning
with the costs and consequences of America’s continued addiction to
them. But a wide variety of peace, arms-control, health, and
public-policy-focused groups are already building on the attention
garnered by the film to engage in a public education campaign aimed at
reviving a movement to control and eventually eliminate the nuclear
danger.</p>
<p>Past experience — from the <a href="https://cnduk.org/">Campaign for
Nuclear Disarmament</a> that helped persuade Christopher Nolan to make
<em>Oppenheimer </em>to the “<a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/10/nuclear-disarmament-activists-putin-ukraine">Ban
the Bomb</a>” and <a
href="https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2010_12/LookingBack">Nuclear
Freeze</a> campaigns that stopped above-ground nuclear testing and helped
turn President Ronald Reagan around on the nuclear issue — suggests
that, given concerted public pressure, progress can be made on reining
in the nuclear threat. The public education effort surrounding the
Oppenheimer film is being taken up by groups like <em>The Bulletin
of the Atomic Scientists, </em>the Federation of American
Scientists, and the Council for a Livable World that were founded, at
least in part, by Manhattan Project scientists who devoted their lives
to trying to roll back the nuclear arms race; professional groups like
the Union of Concerned Scientists and Physicians for Social
Responsibility; anti-war groups like Peace Action and Win Without War;
the Nobel Peace prize-winning International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear
Weapons; nuclear policy groups like Global Zero and the Arms Control
Association; advocates for Marshall Islanders, “downwinders,” and other
victims of the nuclear complex; and faith-based groups like the Friends
Committee on National Legislation. The Native American–led
organization Tewa Women United has even created a <a
href="https://tewawomenunited.org/2023/07/oppenheimer-and-the-other-side-of-the-story">website</a>,
“Oppenheimer — and the Other Side of the Story,” that focuses on “the
Indigenous and land-based peoples who were displaced from our homelands,
the poisoning and contamination of sacred lands and waters that
continues to this day, and the ongoing devastating impact of nuclear
colonization on our lives and livelihoods.”</p>
<p>On the global level, the 2021 entry into force of a nuclear ban
treaty — officially known as the <a
href="https://www.nti.org/education-center/treaties-and-regimes/treaty-on-the-prohibition-of-nuclear-weapons/">Treaty
on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons</a> — is a sign of hope, even if
the nuclear weapons states have yet to join. The very existence of such
a treaty does at least help delegitimize nuclear weaponry. It has even
prompted <a
href="https://www.dontbankonthebomb.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/PAX_Rapport_DBotB_Risky-Returns_FINAL_web_spread.pdf">dozens</a>
of major financial institutions to stop investing in the nuclear weapons
industry, under pressure from campaigns like <a
href="https://www.dontbankonthebomb.com/">Don’t Bank on the
Bomb</a>.</p>
<p>In truth, the situation couldn’t be simpler: we need to <a
href="https://www.armscontrol.org/events/2021-03/ending-nuclear-weapons-before-they-end-us-opportunities-under-biden-administration">abolish
nuclear weapons</a> before they abolish us. Hopefully,
<em>Oppenheimer </em>will help prepare the ground for progress
in that all too essential undertaking, beginning with a frank discussion
of what’s now at stake.</p>
