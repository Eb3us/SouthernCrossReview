<h1>The Associative Principle</h1>
<h3>its application in the air transport industry</h3>

<p><strong>Author’s note</strong>: This article was originally published
in <em>Interavia,</em> a leading Geneva based aviation trade magazine,
in May 1975. At the time, the international airlines met regularly to
set fares, conditions of travel and practically all elements of
international air transportation. This was done within their trade
organization, the International Air Transport Association (IATA). Fare
setting was possible because IATA had been granted exemption from
anti-trust laws. If this sounds unusual today, it did not seem strange
then, because air transportation was still considered to be a public
service and therefore needful of special government protection. A few
years after the article was published, however, the U.S. government
rescinded the anti-trust exemption and most other governments were
eventually forced to follow suit.</p>
<p>The result, “open skies”, resulted in a savage dog-eat-dog
competition, finally culminating in the bankruptcy and disappearance of
many airlines; most of them United States flag carriers. To name a few:
Panam, Panagra, TWA, Eastern, Braniff. Most non-U.S. carriers were
government owned and/or protected, and better able to survive, although
even state owned Latin American airlines succumbed: Viasa, Aeroperu,
Varig (recently), etc. In Europe Sabena, and even I was surprised when
Swissair, arguably the best airline of all, disappeared. Airline
travelers who are old enough to remember will not have to be told about
the sharp decline in passenger service, the increase in delays, missed
connections, etc., despite much improved technology.</p>
<p>I cannot say I foresaw the totality of the disaster, but I did think
that the anti-trust immunity could not last (there were already
rumblings about it), so I wrote the following article. As an employee of
IATA, I was contractually obliged to submit the article to top
management for approval. The Director General at the time, Knut
Hammarskjold, who apparently personally agreed with the sentiments
expressed, finally agreed, but with the proviso that it not appear under
my name. (IATA could not appear to be endorsing a concept with the
airlines themselves would probably not accept.) Therefore it appeared as
having been written by “Francis Tate”, without the usual bio.</p>
<p>I am not republishing the article now in order to say “I told you
so”, but merely to suggest that the “Associative Principle” is still
valid, not only for the airline industry, but for industry in
general.</p>
<p>FTS</p>
<p><img src="triangle.jpg" class="a"/></p>
<p><strong>Almost overnight</strong>, consumerism has become a household
word integrated into vocabularies of the world’s languages. The consumer
has become aware of his rights and of the influence which he is in a
position lo exert on the economic process trough concerted action. In
the air transport field the consumer-passengers have begun to organize
and demand their rights; even to the extent of over-reaction in the form
of emotionalism, headline-hunting and court actions against airlines,
travel agencies and even governmental regulatory bodies. The airlines
and, to a lesser extent, the travel agents, who have had things their
own way for a long time, are beginning to realize that it takes three to
tango in economic enterprises: producers, distributors and
consumers.</p>

<p><strong>Trade associations</strong></p>

<p>The producer-airlines have long had their own trade associations,
principally the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and the
US domestic Air Transport Association (ATA), while other regional
associations have more recently appeared on the scene. These are unique
organizations within which, at least in the case of IATA, member
airlines are allowed to meet regularly and openly fix fares, cargo rates
and other conditions of transportation in spite of strict anti-trust
laws. The explanation for this extraordinary situation is that
governments recognize the importance of the public service nature of air
transport, as well as the great complexity of the international
relations which are involved in its make-up. The individual states, even
those which own their national carriers outright, are obliged to concede
the indispensability of these associations because they are aware that
their own bureaucratic nature prevents them from performing the
functions of an IATA themselves. Most are conscious of the fact that if
there were no IATA, the political states would have to take over its
functions, and the ensuing chaos is eminently predictable.</p>
<p>The distributor-travel agents also have their trade associations on a
local, regional and international level. It is only recently however,
that a spirit of cooperation has become visible in the relations between
the international airline and agent bodies. The airlines fear that
organized agents might eventually succeed in squeezing more and / or
unreasonable commissions out of their already bleeding pocketbooks. On
the other side there has been considerable resentment amongst agents,
who have felt that the airlines have been acting arbitrarily in refusing
even to discuss this point seriously with them. The situation has
evolved however, to the point where IATA and UFTAA (Universal Federation
of Travel Agents Associations) are having regular contacts and where
even the president of UFTAA, P. Bamberger, has expressed “high hopes and
beliefs” that acceptable solutions will be found to differences between
the two organizations. In a recent meeting of the IATA Industry Policy
Committee, chaired by IATA’s Director General, Knut Hammarskjold, member
airlines finally decided to meet the commission question head-on, by
recommending that their Traffic Committee continue discussions with
travel agency organizations with a view to coming to an agreement
concerning commissions as well as other outstanding airline-agency
questions such as joint market development, cooperative advertising,
wholesaler compensation and even compliance, which has long been an
irritating factor. The Policy Committee went so far as to say that in
its opinion “the Traffic Committee should consider any short-term
solution in relation to a long-term policy…”.</p>
<p>Once the differences are resolved however, or even before, it will be
necessary to <em>work together</em>-not to merely stop fighting. An
outstanding example of what can be achieved through cooperation is the
IATA/UFTAA jointly sponsored Agents’ Professional Training Course which,
as it gradually expands over the globe, is greatly increasing the degree
of professionalism in the travel industry. These beginnings are to be
applauded, but much more is needed for the development of a truly
rational air transport policy: the third corner of the triangle is empty
and the consumer-passengers are still on the outside looking in.</p>

<p><strong>What about the Consumer?</strong></p>

<p>One of the basic principles of economic enterprise - the Associative
Principle - is mostly overlooked and only partially practiced in certain
public service industries, although conditions make it so clearly
appropriate that one wonders why those responsible are not more
conscious of it. Perhaps, as is so often the case, because it is so
obvious.</p>
<p>The Associative Principle is based upon another, largely unrealized
fact of life: that work is essentially of a fraternal nature. This can
be clearly seen, as an example, at a modern assembly line, where the
division of labour has been carried to such an extreme that the workers
have become, in a sense, its victims. Each worker usually performs one
or few actions which, together with many other sim ilar actions by other
workers, eventually results in a finished product, whether it be a pair
of shoes, a suit, an automobile or an aircraft. Other contributors to
the production of the end-product are the designer, the engineer,
manager, clerical workers and so on. The answer to the question: For
whom did they produce the aircraft or the shoes? is: not for themselves,
but for others. This working for others is a fraternal process, be it
conscious or not, and these “others” have acquired a specific
designation in economic terminology: consumers.</p>
<p>The fraternal nature of the air transport industry is often expressed
differently. It is called a public service industry, which it certainly
is, and this public service consists of providing safe, regular and
economic air transportation to the public, that is, to “others”. If we
recognize that the reason we occupy ourselves with selling air tickets
or servicing aircraft or flying them or writing about all these things,
is to serve the needs of the consumer-passengers, then we must look for
a method of performing this activity which is not only the most
efficient, but which also corresponds to the fraternal nature of the
activity. The appropriate method is the Associative Method, a phenomenon
which has already appeared on the horizon, but which is not yet clearly
recognized.</p>

<p><strong>The principle</strong></p>
<p>  In the air transport industry we have:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>airline associations;</li>
<li>travel agents associations;</li>
<li>Passengers associations (consumer groups).</li>
</ol>
<p>     </p>
<p>The Associative Principle indicates that the producers, the
distributers and the consumers, the three groups directly involved in
any economic process, should associate in order to arrive at the
solutions to their common problems. Each is equally important and should
have an equal voice in the decision-making process. (Efforts to
“eliminate the middle man” in order to bring prices down are sheer
nonsense. The middlemen perform a function which in fact causes prices
to be lower in the long run than they otherwise would be, since neither
the producer nor the consumer can consistently perform it as efficiently
as they can).</p>
<p>Presently, with the exception of the example cited above, the three
types of associations are generally engaged in fighting <em>against</em>
each other in egotistic self-interest, instead of cooperating
<em>with</em> each other for the benefit of the common interest. As
separate, unassociated (with each other) groups, this is the type of
conduct which must be expected from them. No passenger, as things stand,
when the airlines offer him a fare of 100 dollars is likely to object,
“No, that is too little for your needs, After all, you must pay off the
debt incurred because of these new aircraft you bought, not to mention
agents’ commissions, landing fees, navigation fees, excessive fuel
prices, inflation and God only knows what else. I will pay 120 dollars”.
This is perhaps a grotesque example. Nevertheless, in integrated
associations all three sides will be able to survey the overall picture
and work together for what their new insight will show them to be the
best possible course of action, even though one group’s immediate profit
may be sacrificed. The common interest will be seen as the essential
element in the decision making process.</p>
<p>The general, but not absolute, tendency of airlines as producers of
air transportation, like all producers, is to favour higher prices. (In
the case of the non-scheduled charter operators which have opted for
lower prices, we have a situation in which these carriers have taken
advantage of the fact that the scheduled airlines were already
performing the real public service of operating regularly scheduled
flights, and the undercutting of fares was possible only because they
themselves were not required to perform this service.) The passengers
tend to favour lower prices and the travel agent is in the middle,
knowing that low fares enable him to sell more, but realizing at the
same time that the higher the fare, the larger his commission will be.
He would therefore tend to assume the mediator’s role on the fares
question in an association comprised of the representatives of the three
groups.</p>
<p>The passenger would assume the mediating role in such questions as
agency commissions and productivity norms, and the airlines would take
it over when such problems as inclusive tour services, credit
arrangements, cargo agents’ disbursement fees, etc., are discussed.</p>

<p><strong>Ideally…</strong></p>

<p><em>Human reason</em> could make its debut. For instance, no
knowledgeable passenger representative would demand a fare which is
economically unviable if he is present at the moment of decision on what
the fare should be and participates in that decision, instead of merely
being informed of the fare he must pay after it has been unilaterally
decided upon by the airlines. In the open and fraternal atmosphere of an
integrated association, each group’s demands would be agreed to only to
the extent they are justifiable and are seen to contribute to the mutual
benefit of all concerned.</p>
<p>It should be noted that once the consumer-passengers are in a
position to represent their own interests as members of integrated
associations, it will no longer be necessary for political states to act
as defenders of their interests. Therefore, an extremely important
side-effect of the Associative Method is the reduction of governmental
influence and interference in what is essentially an economic and not a
political enterprise.</p>
<p>The necessary elements for the realization of the Associative
Principle are already with us in the form of separate associations of
airlines, travel agents and passengers. When these three basic groups
form <em>integrated</em> associations, then a giant stride toward a
healthy air transport industry will have been taken.</p>
