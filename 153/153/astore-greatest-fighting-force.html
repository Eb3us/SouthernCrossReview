<h3>The Perpetual Wars You Aren't Supposed to Notice</h3>


</header>

<main>
<p class="intro">In his message to the troops prior to the July 4th weekend, Secretary
of Defense Lloyd Austin offered high praise indeed. “We have the
greatest fighting force in human history,” he tweeted, connecting that
claim to the U.S. having patriots of all colors, creeds, and backgrounds
“who bravely volunteer to defend our country and our values.”</p>
<p>As a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel from a working-class
background who volunteered to serve more than four decades ago, who am I
to argue with Austin? Shouldn’t I just bask in the glow of his praise
for today’s troops, reflecting on my own honorable service near the end
of what now must be thought of as the First Cold War?</p>
<p><span id="anchor"></span>Yet I confess to having doubts. I’ve heard
it all before. The hype. The hyperbole. I still remember how, soon after
the 9/11 attacks, President George W. Bush <a
href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/post/174957">boasted</a> that this
country had “<a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/22/washington/w23policytext.html">the
greatest force</a> for human liberation the world has ever known.” I
also remember how, in a pep talk given to U.S. troops in Afghanistan in
2010, President Barack Obama <a
href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/archive/175337">declared</a> them “the
finest fighting force that the world has ever known.” And yet, 15 years
ago at <em>TomDispatch</em>, I was already <a
href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/archive/175337">wondering</a> when
Americans had first become so proud of, and insistent upon, declaring
our military the world’s absolute best, a force beyond compare, and what
that meant for a republic that once had viewed large standing armies and
constant warfare as <a
href="https://bracingviews.com/2013/06/28/no-nation-can-preserve-its-freedom-in-the-midst-of-continual-warfare/">anathemas
to freedom</a>.</p>
<p>In retrospect, the answer is all too straightforward: we need
<em>something</em> to boast about, don’t we? In the once-upon-a-time “<a
href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/01/yes-america-can-still-lead-the-world/576427/">exceptional
nation</a>,” what else is there to praise to the skies or consider our
pride and joy these days except <a
href="https://tomdispatch.com/william-astore-wars-don-t-make-heroes/">our
heroes</a>? After all, this country can no longer boast of having
anything like the world’s best educational outcomes, or healthcare
system, or the most advanced and safest infrastructure, or the best
democratic politics, so we better damn well be able to boast about
having “the greatest fighting force” ever.</p>
<p>Leaving that boast aside, Americans could certainly brag about one
thing this country has beyond compare: the <a
href="https://tomdispatch.com/congress-has-been-captured-by-the-arms-industry/">most
expensive</a> military around and possibly ever. No country even comes
close to our commitment of funds to wars, weapons (including nuclear
ones at the Department of Energy), and global dominance. Indeed, the
Pentagon’s budget for “defense” in 2023 exceeds that of the <a
href="https://www.pgpf.org/blog/2023/04/the-united-states-spends-more-on-defense-than-the-next-10-countries-combined#:~:text=April%2024%2C%202023-,The%20United%20States%20Spends%20More%20on%20Defense%20than%20the%20Next,Peace%20Research%20Institute%20(SIPRI).">next
10 countries</a> (mostly allies!) combined.</p>
<p>And from all of this, it seems to me, two questions arise: Are we
truly getting what we pay so dearly for — the bestest, finest, most
exceptional military ever? And even if we are, should a self-proclaimed
democracy really want such a thing?</p>
<p>The answer to both those questions is, of course, no. After all,
America hasn’t won a war in a convincing fashion since 1945. If this
country keeps losing wars routinely and often enough catastrophically,
as it has in places like Vietnam, Afghanistan, and Iraq, how can we
honestly say that we possess the world’s greatest fighting force? And if
we nevertheless persist in such a boast, doesn’t that echo the rhetoric
of militaristic empires of the past? (Remember when we used to think
that only unhinged dictators like Adolf Hitler boasted of having
peerless warriors in a megalomaniacal pursuit of global domination?)</p>
<p>Actually, I do believe the United States has the most exceptional
military, just not in the way its boosters and cheerleaders like Austin,
Bush, and Obama claimed. How is the U.S. military truly “exceptional”?
Let me count the ways.</p>
<p><strong>The Pentagon as a Budgetary Black Hole</strong></p>
<p>In so many ways, the U.S. military is indeed exceptional. Let’s begin
with its budget. At this very moment, Congress is debating a colossal
“defense” budget of $886 billion for FY2024 (and all the debate is <a
href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/07/27/senate-oks-defense-bill-setting-up-clash-with-house-over-abortion-lgbtq-measures-00108682">about
issues</a> that have little to do with the military). That defense
spending bill, you may recall, was “only” $740 billion when President
Joe Biden took office three years ago. In 2021, Biden withdrew U.S.
forces from the disastrous war in Afghanistan, theoretically saving the
taxpayer nearly $50 billion a year. Yet, in place of any sort of peace
dividend, American taxpayers simply got an even higher bill as the
Pentagon budget continued to soar.</p>
<p>Recall that, in his four years in office, Donald Trump increased
military spending by 20%. Biden is now poised to achieve a similar 20%
increase in <a
href="https://stephensemler.substack.com/p/reversing-a-146b-military-buildup">just
three years</a> in office. And that increase largely doesn’t even
include the cost of supporting Ukraine in its war with Russia — so far,
somewhere between <a
href="https://www.crfb.org/blogs/congress-approved-113-billion-aid-ukraine-2022">$120
billion</a> and $200 billion and still rising.</p>
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1642598348/ref=nosim/?tag=tomdispatch-20">

<img class="b" src="bacevich-shedding-bc.png" alt="Bacevich Book cover" style="width:100%">
<div class="container"><p>Buy the Book!</p></div></div></a>
<p>Colossal budgets for weapons and war enjoy broad bipartisan support
in Washington. It’s almost as if there were a <a
href="https://tomdispatch.com/can-the-military-industrial-complex-be-tamed/">military-industrial-congressional
complex</a> at work here! Where, in fact, did I ever hear a president
warning us about that? Oh, perhaps I’m thinking of a certain <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyBNmecVtdU">farewell address</a>
by Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1961.</p>
<p>In all seriousness, there’s now a huge pentagonal-shaped black hole
on the Potomac that’s devouring more than half of the federal
discretionary budget annually. Even when Congress and the Pentagon
allegedly try to enforce fiscal discipline, if not austerity elsewhere,
the crushing gravitational pull of that hole just continues to <a
href="https://tomdispatch.com/the-ultimate-all-american-slush-fund/">suck
in</a> more money. Bet on that continuing as the Pentagon issues ever
more warnings about a <a
href="https://tomdispatch.com/arsenal-of-democracy-or-simply-an-arsenal/">new
cold war</a> with China and Russia.</p>
<p>Given its money-sucking nature, perhaps you won’t be surprised to
learn that the Pentagon is remarkably exceptional when it comes to
failing fiscal audits — five of them in a row (the fifth failure being a
“<a
href="https://thehill.com/policy/defense/3740921-defense-department-fails-another-audit-but-makes-progress/">teachable
moment</a>,” according to its chief financial officer) — as its budget
only continued to soar. Whether you’re talking about lost wars or failed
audits, the Pentagon is eternally rewarded for its failures. Try running
a “Mom and Pop” store on that basis and see how long you last.</p>
<p>Speaking of all those failed wars, perhaps you won’t be surprised to
learn that they haven’t come cheaply. According to the <a
href="https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/">Costs of War Project</a> at
Brown University, roughly <a
href="https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/figures/2021/WarDeathToll">937,000
people</a> have died since 9/11/2001 thanks to direct violence in this
country’s “Global War on Terror” in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and
elsewhere. (And the deaths of another <a
href="https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/papers/2023/IndirectDeaths">3.6
to 3.7 million people</a> may be indirectly attributable to those same
post-9/11 conflicts.) The financial cost to the American taxpayer has
been roughly <a
href="https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/figures/2021/BudgetaryCosts">$8
trillion</a> and rising even as the U.S. military continues its
counterterror preparations and activities in <a
href="https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/papers/2021/USCounterterrorismOperations">85
countries</a>.</p>
<p>No other nation in the world sees its military as (to borrow from a
short-lived <a
href="https://www.npr.org/2015/06/13/414239773/why-the-navy-abandoned-its-latest-slogan">Navy
slogan</a>) “a global force for good.” No other nation divides the whole
world into military commands like <a
href="https://tomdispatch.com/getting-to-yes/">AFRICOM</a> for Africa
and CENTCOM for the Middle East and parts of Central and South Asia,
headed up by four-star generals and admirals. No other nation has a
network of <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Base-Nation-Military-Abroad-America/dp/1510728813/ref=bracingviews-20">750
foreign bases</a> scattered across the globe. No other nation strives
for full-spectrum dominance through “<a
href="https://bracingviews.substack.com/p/all-domain-operations-hubris-unleashed">all-domain
operations</a>,” meaning not only the control of traditional “domains”
of combat — the land, sea, and air — but also of space and cyberspace.
While other countries are focused mainly on national defense (or
regional aggressions of one sort or another), the U.S. military strives
for total global and spatial dominance. Truly exceptional!</p>
<p>Strangely, in this never-ending, unbounded pursuit of dominance,
results simply don’t matter. The Afghan War? Bungled, botched, and lost.
The Iraq War? Built on lies and lost. Libya? <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DXDU48RHLU">We came, we saw</a>,
Libya’s leader (and so many innocents) died. Yet no one at the Pentagon
was punished for any of those failures. In fact, to this day, it remains
an accountability-free zone, exempt from meaningful oversight. If you’re
a “<a
href="https://www.classical-music.com/features/articles/modern-major-general-lyrics/">modern
major general</a>,” why not pursue wars when you know you’ll <a
href="http://armedforcesjournal.com/a-failure-in-generalship/">never be
punished</a> for losing them?</p>
<p>Indeed, the few “exceptions” within the
military-industrial-congressional complex who stood up for
accountability, people of principle like Daniel Hale, Chelsea Manning,
and Edward Snowden, were imprisoned or exiled. In fact, the U.S.
government has even conspired to imprison a foreign publisher and
transparency activist, Julian Assange, who published the truth about the
American war on terror, by using a World War I-era espionage clause that
only applies to American citizens.</p>
<p>And the record is even grimmer than that. In our post-9/11 years at
war, as President Barack Obama <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBLNohqquRk">admitted</a>, “We
tortured some folks” — and the only person punished for that was another
whistleblower, <a
href="https://www.democracynow.org/2015/2/9/exclusive_freed_cia_whistleblower_john_kiriakou">John
Kiriakou</a>, who did his best to bring those <a
href="http://www.niemanwatchdog.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=ask_this.view&amp;askthisid=386">war
crimes</a> to our attention.</p>
<p>And speaking of war crimes, isn’t it “exceptional” that the U.S.
military plans to spend upwards of $2 trillion in the coming decades on
a new generation of <a
href="https://tomdispatch.com/peace-is-not-our-profession/">genocidal
nuclear weapons</a>? Those include new stealth bombers and new
intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) for the Air Force, as well
as new nuclear-missile-firing submarines for the Navy. Worse yet, the
U.S. continues to <a
href="https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2022-04/news/biden-policy-allows-first-use-nuclear-weapons">reserve
the right</a> to use nuclear weapons first, presumably in the name of
protecting life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. And of course,
despite the countries — <a
href="https://www.icanw.org/how_many_countries_have_nuclear_weapons_and_how_many_are_there">nine</a>!
— that now possess nukes, the U.S. remains the only one to have used
them in wartime, in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.</p>
<p>Finally, it turns out that the military is even immune from Supreme
Court decisions! When SCOTUS recently overturned affirmative action for
college admission, it carved out <a
href="https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/affirmative-action-military-academies/">an
exception</a> for the military academies. Schools like West Point and
Annapolis can still consider the race of their applicants, presumably to
<a
href="https://www.thenation.com/article/society/supreme-court-affirmative-action-military-academies/">promote
unit cohesion</a> through proportional representation of minorities
within the officer ranks, but our society at large apparently does not
require racial equity for its cohesion.</p>
<p><strong>A Most Exceptional Military Makes Its Wars and Their Ugliness
Disappear</strong></p>
<p>Here’s one of my favorite lines from the movie <a
href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114814/?ref_=tt_ch"><em>The Usual
Suspects</em></a><em>: “</em>The greatest trick the devil ever pulled
was convincing the world he did not exist.” The greatest trick the U.S.
military ever pulled was essentially convincing us that its wars never
existed. As Norman Solomon notes in his revealing book, <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1620977915/ref=nosim/?tag=tomdispatch-20"><em>War
Made Invisible</em></a>, the military-industrial-congressional complex
has excelled at camouflaging the <a
href="https://bracingviews.com/2017/10/11/the-atrocious-nature-of-the-vietnam-war/">atrocious
realities</a> of war, rendering them almost entirely invisible to the
American people. Call it the <a
href="https://tomdispatch.com/william-astore-the-face-of-war-don-t-look/">new
American isolationism</a>, only this time we’re isolated from the
harrowing and horrific costs of war itself.</p>
<p>America is a nation perpetually at war, yet most of us live our lives
with little or no perception of this. There is no longer a military
draft. There are no war bond drives. You aren’t asked to make direct and
personal sacrifices. You aren’t even asked to pay attention, let alone
pay (except for those nearly trillion-dollar-a-year budgets and interest
payments on a ballooning national debt, of course). You certainly aren’t
asked for your permission for this country to fight its wars, as the <a
href="https://contraryperspective.com/2015/01/12/why-america-keeps-losing-its-wars/">Constitution
demands</a>. As President George W. Bush suggested after the 9/11
attacks, <a
href="https://transcripts.cnn.com/show/smn/date/2001-10-06/segment/26">go
visit Disneyworld</a>! Enjoy life! Let America’s “best and brightest”
handle the brutality, the degradation, and the ugliness of war, bright
minds like former Vice President Dick (“<a
href="https://archive.nytimes.com/thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/03/19/cheney-unconcerned-by-iraq-wars-unpopularity/">So?</a>”)
Cheney and former Secretary of Defense Donald (“<a
href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/06/30/donald-rumsfeld-iraq-war-architect-dead-at-88/">I
don’t do quagmires</a>”) Rumsfeld.</p>
<p>Did you hear something about the U.S. military being in <a
href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/senate-backs-mcconnells-rebuke-of-trumps-military-drawdown-plans-in-syria-afghanistan/2019/01/31/5812d058-2584-11e9-90cd-dedb0c92dc17_story.html">Syria</a>?
In <a
href="https://airwars.org/conflict/us-forces-in-somalia/">Somalia</a>?
Did you hear about the U.S. military supporting the Saudis in a brutal
war of repression in <a
href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-29319423">Yemen</a>?
Did you notice how this country’s military interventions around the
world kill, wound, and displace so many people of color, so much so that
observers speak of the <a
href="https://www.salon.com/2023/06/27/americas-systemic-racism-isnt-just-domestic-consider-dies-around-the-world-in-our/">systemic
racism</a> of America’s wars? Is it truly progress that a more diverse
military in terms of “color, creed, and background,” to use Secretary of
Defense Austin’s words, has killed and is killing so many non-white
peoples around the globe?</p>
<p>Praising the <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnJyGSMUt2E">all-female-crewed</a>
flyover at the last Super Bowl or painting <a
href="https://bracingviews.substack.com/p/us-foreign-policy-in-one-image">rainbow
flags</a> of inclusivity (or even blue and yellow flags <a
href="https://bracingviews.substack.com/p/praise-the-lord-and-pass-the-cluster">for
Ukraine</a>) on <a
href="https://tomdispatch.com/the-united-states-refuses-to-play-by-the-worlds-rules/">cluster
munitions</a> won’t soften the blows or quiet the screams. As one reader
of my blog <a href="https://bracingviews.substack.com/">Bracing
Views</a> so aptly put it: “The diversity the war parties [Democrats and
Republicans] will not tolerate is diversity of thought.”</p>
<p>Of course, the U.S. military isn’t solely to blame here. Senior
officers will claim their duty is not to make policy at all but to
salute smartly as the president and Congress order them about. The
reality, however, is different. The military is, in fact, at the core of
America’s <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Shadow-Government-Surveillance-Security-Single-Superpower/dp/1608463656/ref=bracingviews-20">shadow
government</a> with enormous influence over policymaking. It’s not
merely an instrument of power; it is power — and exceptionally powerful
at that. And that form of power simply isn’t conducive to liberty and
freedom, whether inside America’s borders or beyond them.</p>
<p>Wait! What am I saying? Stop thinking about all that! America is,
after all, the exceptional nation and its military, a band of freedom
fighters. In Iraq, where war and sanctions killed untold numbers of
Iraqi children in the 1990s, the sacrifice was “<a
href="https://www.newsweek.com/watch-madeleine-albright-saying-iraqi-kids-deaths-worth-it-resurfaces-1691193">worth
it</a>,” as former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright once reassured
Americans on <em>60 Minutes</em>.</p>
<p>Even when government actions kill children, lots of children, it’s
for the greater good. If this troubles you, go to Disney and take your
kids with you. You don’t like Disney? Then, hark back to that <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pack_Up_Your_Troubles_in_Your_Old_Kit-Bag">old
marching song</a> of World War I and “pack up your troubles in your old
kit-bag, and smile, smile, smile.” Remember, America’s troops are
freedom-delivering heroes and your job is to smile and support them
without question.</p>
<p>Have I made my point? I hope so. And yes, the U.S. military is indeed
exceptional and being so, being #1 (or claiming you are anyway) means
never having to say you’re sorry, no matter how many innocents you kill
or maim, how many lives you disrupt and destroy, how many lies you
tell.</p>
<p>I must admit, though, that, despite the endless celebration of our
military’s exceptionalism and “greatness,” a fragment of scripture from
my Catholic upbringing haunts me still: <em>Pride goeth before
destruction and a haughty spirit before a fall</em>.</p>
