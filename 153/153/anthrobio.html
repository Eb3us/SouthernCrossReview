<p class="intro"><em>When I moved with my family to the country from Buenos Aires 14
years ago, we lived in an old house, once the core building of an</em>
estancia<em>. There were ten acres of what was once farmland, but had
turned into what my son, ten years old at the time, rather romantically
and with his flair for exaggeration called a jungle. After a few days of
snooping around in the “jungle” with his dog, he found a rusty old lunch
pail. It had no lock on it, but it was rusted tightly shut, so he
brought it to me to open, which I did with the help of a chisel and
hammer. Instead of a rotted chicken leg, we found a…what should I call
it? An essay, or simply an unfinished manuscript. Translated into
English, it reads as follows.</em></p>
<p>We were four or five men, all about the same age, in our early
forties, except for Dr. Bernard Lievegoed, who was in his mid-sixties
then, and Lex Bos, seven years older than I. We were of different
nationalities – I remember a Swiss who lived in Sao Paulo, Brazil, a
German who lived in Johannesburg, South Africa. The others were
Europeans, if I remember correctly. And I, an Argentine who was about to
escape from my own country to Spain. Lievegoed and Bos were Dutch and we
were in the Dutch city of Zeist, at the headquarters of NPI – the
Netherlands Pedagogic Institute.</p>
<p>In spite of its name, NPI was – and still is – a consulting firm.
Bernard Lievegoed, a physician, psychiatrist and university professor,
was its founder. At that time, 1974, it was called NPI International,
because of its intention to expand its network around the world. In
fact, that’s what we were doing there. Lievegoed gave a kind of
introductory talk. He started by saying: “We are the lucky ones…”</p>
<p>I can’t say that I had been “recruited” by Lex Bos, because keeping
one’s eye out for potential co-workers isn’t the same thing.
Furthermore, I probably asked him about joining NPI rather then he
asking me if I wanted to. At the time I had what many considered a good
job – as an investigator for IATA, the International Air Transport
Association – and senior man in Argentina. But I was just at that age
when grown men buy their first motorcycles and change wives.
Furthermore, Argentina was being terrorized by leftist revolutionaries,
specifically the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Revolutionary_Army_%28Argentina%29">Ejército
Revolucionario del Pueblo</a>, which specialized in kidnapping business
executives. My colleagues, the airline managers, had moved their offices
across the Rio de la Plata to Montevideo, in Uruguay. You see, the
possibility of being kidnapped for ransom and political statement was
quite real. I felt that the work I was doing was not worth it. Something
else influenced my decision; in fact, it was the main reason:
anthroposophy.</p>
<p>The first time I’d heard of it was when I was a student in Germany.
My future wife’s aunt and uncle were anthroposophists and they told me
about it during several conversations about things existential. What
interested me about it was that it included the idea of reincarnation,
yet was philosophically western; that is, it’s founder and principal
protagonist was Rudolf Steiner, an Austrian philosopher and
esotericist.</p>
<p>I found work with Argentine Airlines in Germany without having
finished my studies in business administration. After a few years, I was
included in the airline’s management training program and transferred to
head office in Buenos Aires. By that time I was married and had a
three-year-old daughter. We found a small house in a Buenos Aires suburb
called Florida, at that time still heavily populated by German
immigrants – including Jews and Nazis, who seemed to get along rather
well there. The Nazis never admitted to having been of that persuasion
of course. Three blocks from our home was the “Rudolf Steiner Schule”.
My wife was German, so that was our daughter’s mother tongue, and I of
course spoke German from my time in Germany, so it seemed practical to
send the child to that school…just to the kindergarten, I thought,
because I intended to send her to an American or English primary school,
English being, I felt, much more important for her future.</p>
<p>As it turned out, though, my daughter loved the kindergarten so, and
the whole school atmosphere impressed my wife and me and so much, that
we decided to let her continue in the primary school.</p>
<p>Steiner or Waldorf schools are based on anthroposophy, which reminded
me of Aunt Trude and uncle Karl back in Frankfurt. But when I asked
questions about anthroposophy in the Steiner Schule in Florida, I was
referred to a priest in the Christian community – a church whose
theology is based on Rudolf Steiner’s teachings about Christianity. I
soon found myself in a study group reading a series of Steiner lectures
about “The Gospel of St. Luke” - in German of course. It floored me. I
was born and raised Roman Catholic, but had moved away from the Church,
mostly because of all the unanswered questions – the ones they answer by
saying “it’s a mystery” – which is, of course, no answer. Well, Steiner
answered them all, or most all. Not only religious questions though.</p>
<p>Due to a crisis in the Rudolf Steiner School when my daughter was in
the second grade, a group of parents took our kids out and started a new
school, a new Waldorf school, as best we could. So I got more and more
deeply involved – as president of the Board and teacher of English – one
hour a day, so I kept my day job. I realized that the Waldorf
educational system, based on anthroposophy, provides the spiritual and
artistic warmth children need, something different than what the
mainstream schools practice. And it works, the children are happy and
they thrive.</p>
<p>Steiner also wrote a book about “the social question”. He was talking
about his time of course, but there is much in it that is applicable
today: <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Toward-Threefold-Society-Issues-Question/dp/1948302195/">Toward
a Threefold Society</a>. I read it during the Cold War, when the duality
of capitalism-communism dominated the political-social scene. Here, I
thought, was a “third way”. What also impressed me was that the same guy
who went on and on about the spiritual world, initiation, science and
religion, was also into politics and economics.</p>
<p>So when Bernard Lievegoed in Holland said: “We are the lucky ones…”
and ended the sentence with, “…for we have anthroposophy, and are
therefore morally obliged to help the others, who do not have it,” I was
somewhat surprised that he included me in those who “had” anthroposophy,
and it started me thinking about what that means. I’m still thinking
about it and can at least say what he did <em>not</em> mean:
proselytizing. Lievegoed knew that anthroposophy is not for everyone.
After all, according to Steiner, “Anthroposophy is a path of knowledge
which would guide the spiritual in the human being to the spiritual in
the cosmos. It manifests as a necessity of the heart and feeling. It
must find its justification in being able to satisfy this need…”</p>
<p>For me this meant answering certain existential questions, such as,
<em>Does life have meaning?</em> (If not, what’s the point? If so, what
<em>is</em> that meaning?) I think that Rudolf Steiner answered these
questions. The answer to the first question is: Yes! If proof is needed,
well, just look around – at nature, where we see evidence of
intelligence. Nature is intelligence, and very beautiful, and efficient,
even when “red in tooth and claw”. So if intelligence exists in nature,
some intelligent being or beings must have put it there. Nothing could
be more logical. Spontaneous intelligence is no more possible than
spontaneous life is. The only intelligent beings, and by that I mean
<em>thinking</em> beings, are humans. Yet human beings do not create
nature, they are born into it. Steiner maintained that nature is a
solidified spiritual substance, that everything which exists in the
physical world also exists (or pre-exists) in the spiritual world in
spiritual form and spiritual beings are the artistic creators of the
Earth and nature.</p>
<p>The main question, then, is whether a spiritual world that cares
about human beings really exists. Can we assume that man, a thinking
being – when thinking is a spiritual activity and therefore intimately
related to the spiritual world – was created in order to live a life
without meaning? Well yes, we can assume that. I, however, prefer to
side with Kierkegaard and insist – if only to myself – on the absurdity
of meaningless human life.</p>
<p>The next question we face is: What <em>is</em> that meaning?</p>
<p>We know that life is often – or mostly – cruel and unjust. But not
always! It can also be gentle and beautiful, with traces of love.
Steiner maintained that we are living on a planet, Earth, of love. That
is , the mission of the earth is to <em>become</em> a planet of love.
Obviously that will take a long time, and it’s not a guaranteed outcome.
It requires development – or evolution if you prefer – of consciousness
and knowledge. And, most of all, <em>freedom</em>. Love is not possible
without freedom. So, the reason, the meaning of life, is to develop love
and freedom despite all the material and spiritual obstacles.</p>
<p>If we have convinced ourselves that life is meaningful and there is a
spiritual intelligence behind it, then how do we explain the often
horrible injustices occurring daily in the world, sometimes due to
natural causes, but more often to human depravity? The only explanation
is reincarnation. A dead and/or tortured child can hardly be the
end-product of spiritual intelligence and justice. No, the child must
have an ongoing opportunity to live and evolve – despite death! That can
often only happen in a future incarnation on earth. Dostoyevsky’s Ivan
in <em>The Brothers Karamazov</em> famously does not kill God, like
Nietzsche, that is, consider Him dead or non-existent, but rejects Him
because he allows the suffering of children. Ivan did not consider
reincarnation when condemning God and his holy Russian monk.</p>
<p>If there is reincarnation, there must also be karma – the retribution
for the suffering you’ve caused – and compensation for the suffering you
have undergone, but not necessarily during the same lifetime.</p>
<p>Then there is also “egotistical karma” - which provides practical
reasons for helping the poor and for saving the planet. India, (for
example) presently has 1.2 billion people, most of them poor. And other
parts of the world, including Latin America, are also mostly poor. As
long as such large majorities remain poor, there is much more chance of
us being poor in future incarnations. Or having to live on a polluted
planet. The possibility even exists of there not being a planet to
incarnate onto. Endgame…?</p>
<p><em>The manuscript ends there. I do not know why it was hidden in a
lunchpail and left in the valley of Traslasierra, so far from Buenos
Aires. It is unsigned, so I don’t even know who wrote it – in longhand,
by the way. So I just call him “Z”. After translating it, I looked into
anthroposophy myself, if only because Z was so enthusiastic about it. I
found it quite interesting and have even devoted a section of Southern
Cross Review to it. Z would be happy about that, I feel sure.</em></p>
