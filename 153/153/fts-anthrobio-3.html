I moved with my family to the country from Buenos Aires 14 years ago,
we lived in an old house, once the core building of an </I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">estancia</SPAN><I>.
There were ten acres of what was once farmland, but had turned into
what my son, ten years old at the time, rather romantically and with
his flair for exaggeration called a jungle. After a few days of
snooping around in the &ldquo;jungle&rdquo; with his dog, he found a
rusty old lunch pail. It had no lock on it, but it was rusted tightly
shut, so he brought it to me to open, which I did with the help of a
chisel and hammer. Instead of a rotted chicken leg, we found a...what
should I call it? An essay, or simply an unfinished manuscript.
Translated into English, it reads as follows.          </I></FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Calibri, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>We
were four or five men, all about the same age, in our early forties,
except for Dr. Bernard Lievegoed, who was in his
mid-sixties then, and Lex Bos, seven years older than I. We were of
different nationalities &ndash; I remember a Swiss who lived in Sao
Paulo, Brazil, a German who lived in Johannesburg, South Africa. The
others were Europeans, if I remember correctly. And I, an Argentine
who was about to escape from my own country to Spain. Lievegoed and
Bos were Dutch and we were in the Dutch city of Zeist, at the
headquarters of NPI &ndash; the Netherlands Pedagogic Institute. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Calibri, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>In
spite of its name, NPI was &ndash; and still is &ndash; a consulting
firm. Bernard Lievegoed, a physician, psychiatrist and university professor, was its founder. At that time, 1974, it was called NPI International, because of
its intention to expand its network around the world. In fact, that's
what we were doing there. Lievegoed gave a kind of introductory talk. He started by saying: "We are the lucky ones..."</FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Calibri, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>I
can't say that I had been &ldquo;recruited&rdquo; by Lex Bos, because
keeping one's eye out for potential co-workers isn't the same thing.
Furthermore, I probably asked him about joining NPI rather then he
asking me if I wanted to. At the time I had what many considered a
good job &ndash; as an investigator for IATA, the International Air
Transport Association &ndash; and senior man in Argentina. But I was
just at that age when grown men buy their first motorcycles and
change wives. Furthermore, Argentina was being terrorized by leftist
revolutionaries, specifically the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Revolutionary_Army_%28Argentina%29"<I>Ej&eacute;rcito Revolucionario
del Pueblo</a>, </I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">which specialized in
kidnapping business executives</SPAN>. My colleagues, the airline
managers, had moved their offices across the Rio de la Plata to
Montevideo, in Uruguay. You see, the possibility of being kidnapped
for ransom and political statement was quite real. I felt that the
work I was doing was not worth it. Something else influenced my
decision; in fact, it was the main reason: anthroposophy.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"> 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Calibri, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>The
first time I'd heard of it was when I was a student in Germany. My
future wife's aunt and uncle were anthroposophists and they told me
about it during several conversations about things existential. What
interested me about it was that it included the idea of
reincarnation, yet was philosophically western; that is, it's founder
and principal protagonist  was Rudolf Steiner, an Austrian
philosopher and esotericist.  </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"> 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Calibri, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>I
found work with Argentine Airlines in Germany without having finished
my studies in business administration. After a few years, I was
included in the airline's management training program and transferred
to head office in Buenos Aires. By that time I was married and had a
three-year-old daughter. We found a small house in a Buenos Aires
suburb called Florida, at that time still heavily populated by German
immigrants &ndash; including Jews and Nazis, who seemed to get along
rather well there. The Nazis never admitted to having been of that
persuasion of course. Three blocks from our home was the &ldquo;Rudolf
Steiner Schule&rdquo;. My wife was German, so that was our daughter's
mother tongue, and I of course spoke German from my time in Germany,
so it seemed practical to send the child to that school...just to the
kindergarten, I thought, because I intended to send her to an
American or English primary school, English being, I felt, much more
important for her future.  </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"> 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Calibri, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>As
it turned out, though, my daughter loved the kindergarten so, and the
whole school atmosphere impressed my wife and me and so much, that we
decided to let her continue in the primary school. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Calibri, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Steiner
or Waldorf schools are based on anthroposophy, which reminded me of
Aunt Trude and uncle Karl back in Frankfurt. But when I asked
questions about anthroposophy in the Steiner Schule in Florida, I was
referred to a priest in the Christian community &ndash; a church
whose theology is based on Rudolf Steiner's teachings about
Christianity. I soon found myself in a study group reading a series
of Steiner lectures about &ldquo;The Gospel of St. Luke&rdquo; - in
German of course. It floored me. I was born and raised Roman
Catholic, but had moved away from the Church, mostly because of all
the unanswered questions &ndash; the ones they answer by saying &ldquo;it's
a mystery&rdquo; &ndash; which is, of course, no answer.  Well,
Steiner answered them all, or most all. Not only religious questions
though.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"> 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Calibri, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Due
to a crisis in the Rudolf Steiner School when my daughter was in the
second grade, a group of parents took our kids out and started a new
school, a new Waldorf school, as best we could. So I got more and
more deeply involved &ndash; as president of the Board and teacher of
English &ndash; one hour a day, so I kept my day job. I realized that
the Waldorf educational system, based on anthroposophy, provides the
spiritual and artistic warmth children need, something different than
what the mainstream schools practice. And it works, the children are
happy and they thrive. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"> 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Calibri, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Steiner
also wrote a book about &ldquo;the social question&rdquo;. He was
talking about his time of course, but there is much in it that is
applicable today: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Toward-Threefold-Society-Issues-Question/dp/1948302195/"> Toward a Threefold Society</a>.
 I read it during the Cold War, when the duality of
capitalism-communism dominated the political-social scene. Here, I
thought, was a &ldquo;third way&rdquo;. What also impressed me was
that the same guy who went on and on about the spiritual world,
initiation, science and religion, was also into politics and
economics. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"> 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Calibri, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>So
when Bernard Lievegoed in Holland said: &ldquo;We are the lucky
ones...&rdquo; and ended the sentence with, &ldquo;...for we have
anthroposophy, and are therefore morally obliged to help the others,
who do not have it,&rdquo; I was somewhat surprised that he included
me in those who &ldquo;had&rdquo; anthroposophy, and it started me
thinking about what that means. I'm still thinking about it and can
at least say what he did <I>not</I> mean: proselytizing. Lievegoed
knew that anthroposophy is not for everyone. After all, according to
Steiner, &ldquo;<SPAN LANG="en-US">Anthroposophy is a path of
knowledge which would guide the spiritual in the human being to the
spiritual in the cosmos. It manifests as a necessity of the heart and
feeling. It must find its justification in being able to satisfy this
need...&rdquo;  </SPAN></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"> 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Calibri, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4><SPAN LANG="en-US">For
me this meant answering certain existential questions, such as, </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-US"><I>Does
life have meaning? </I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-US"><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">(If
not, what's the point? If so, what </SPAN></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-US"><I>is</I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-US"><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">
that meaning?) I think that Rudolf Steiner answered these questions.
The answer to the first question is: Yes! If proof is needed, well,
just look around &ndash; at nature, where we see evidence of
intelligence. Nature is intelligence, and very beautiful, and
efficient, even when &ldquo;red in tooth and claw&rdquo;. So if
intelligence exists in nature, some intelligent being or beings must
have put it there. Nothing could be more logical. Spontaneous
intelligence is no more possible than spontaneous life is. The only
intelligent beings, and by that I mean </SPAN></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-US"><I>thinking</I></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-US"><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">
beings, are humans. Yet human beings do not create nature, they are
born into it. Steiner maintained that nature is a solidified
spiritual substance, that everything which exists in the physical
world also exists (or pre-exists) in the spiritual world in spiritual
form and spiritual beings are the artistic creators of the Earth and
nature. </SPAN></SPAN></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal"> 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal"><FONT FACE="Calibri, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>The
main question, then, is whether a spiritual world that cares about
human beings really exists. Can we assume that man, a thinking being
&ndash;  when thinking is a spiritual activity and therefore
intimately related to the spiritual world &ndash; was created  in
order to live a life without meaning? Well yes, we can assume that.
I, however, prefer to side with Kierkegaard and insist &ndash; if
only to myself &ndash; on the absurdity of meaningless human life. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal"> 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal"><FONT FACE="Calibri, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>The
next question we face is: What <I>is</I> that meaning? </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal"> 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal"><FONT FACE="Calibri, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>We
know that life is often &ndash; or mostly &ndash; cruel and unjust.
But not always! It can also be gentle and beautiful, with traces of
love. Steiner maintained that we are living on a planet, Earth, of
love. That is , the mission of the earth is to <I>become</I> a planet
of love. Obviously that will take a long time, and it's not a
guaranteed outcome. It requires development &ndash; or evolution if
you prefer &ndash; of consciousness and knowledge. And, most of all,
<I>freedom</I>. Love is not possible without freedom. So, the reason,
the meaning of life, is to develop love and freedom despite all the
material and spiritual obstacles.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal"> 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal"><FONT FACE="Calibri, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>If
we have convinced ourselves that life is meaningful and there is a
spiritual intelligence behind it, then how do we explain the often
horrible injustices occurring daily in the world, sometimes due to
natural causes, but more often to human depravity? The only
explanation is reincarnation. A dead and/or tortured child can hardly
be the end-product of spiritual intelligence and justice. No, the
child must have an ongoing opportunity to live and evolve &ndash;
despite death!  That can often only happen in a future incarnation on
earth. Dostoyevsky's Ivan in <I>The Brothers Karamazov</I> famously
does not kill God, like Nietzsche, that is, consider Him dead or
non-existent, but rejects Him because he allows the suffering of
children. Ivan did not consider reincarnation when condemning God and
his holy Russian monk. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal"> 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal"><FONT FACE="Calibri, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>If
there is reincarnation, there must also be karma &ndash; the
retribution for the suffering you've caused &ndash; and compensation
for the suffering you have undergone, but not necessarily during the
same lifetime. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal"> 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal"><FONT FACE="Calibri, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Then
there is also &ldquo;egotistical karma&rdquo; - which provides
practical reasons for helping the poor and for saving the planet.
India, (for example) presently has 1.2 billion people, most of them
poor. And other parts of the world, including Latin America, are also
mostly poor. As long as such large majorities remain poor, there is
much more chance of us being poor in  future incarnations. Or having
to live on a polluted planet. The possibility even exists of there
not being a planet to incarnate onto.  Endgame...? </FONT></FONT>

manuscript ends there. I do not know why it was hidden in a lunchpail
and left in the valley of Traslasierra, so far from Buenos Aires. It
is unsigned, so I don't even know who wrote it &ndash; in longhand,
by the way. So I just call him &ldquo;Z&rdquo;. After translating it,
I looked into anthroposophy myself, if only because Z was so
enthusiastic about it. I found it quite interesting and have even
devoted a section of Southern Cross Review to it. Z would be happy
about that, I feel sure.  </I></FONT></FONT>
