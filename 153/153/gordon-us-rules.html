<main>
<p class="intro">In 1963, the summer I turned 11, my mother had a gig evaluating Peace
Corps programs in Egypt and Ethiopia. My younger brother and I spent
most of that summer in France. We were first in Paris with my mother
before she left for North Africa, then with my father and his girlfriend
in a tiny town on the Mediterranean. (In the middle of our six-week
sojourn there, the girlfriend ran off to marry a Czech she’d met, but
that’s another story.)</p>
<p>In Paris, I saw American tourists striding around in their shorts and
sandals, cameras slung around their necks, staking out positions in
cathedrals and museums. I listened to my mother’s commentary on what she
considered their boorishness and insensitivity. In my 11-year-old mind,
I tended to agree. I’d already heard the expression “the ugly American”
— although I then knew nothing about the prophetic <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ugly_American">1958 novel</a>
with that title about U.S. diplomatic bumbling in southeast Asia in the
midst of the Cold War — and it seemed to me that those interlopers in
France fit the term perfectly.</p>
<p><span id="anchor"></span>When I got home, I confided to a friend
(whose parents, I learned years later, worked for the CIA) that
sometimes, while in Europe, I’d felt ashamed to be an American. “You
should never feel that way,” she replied. “This is the best country in
the world!”</p>
<p>Indeed, the United States was, then, the leader of what was known as
“the free world.” Never mind that, throughout the Cold War, we would
actively support dictatorships (in Argentina, Chile, Indonesia,
Nicaragua, and El Salvador, among other places) and actually overthrow
democratizing governments (in Chile, Guatemala, and Iran, for example).
In that era of the G.I. Bill, strong unions, employer-provided
healthcare, and general postwar economic dominance, to most of us who
were white and within reach of the middle class, the United States
probably did look like the best country in the world.</p>
<p>Things do look a bit different today, don’t they? In this century, in
many important ways, the United States has become an outlier and, in
some cases, even an outlaw. Here are three examples of U.S. behavior
that has been literally <a
href="https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&amp;q=define%3A+egregious">egregious</a>,
three ways in which this country has stood out from the crowd in a sadly
malevolent fashion.</p>
<h4>Guantánamo, the Forever Prison Camp</h4>
<p>In January 2002, the administration of President George W. Bush
established an offshore prison camp at the U.S<strong>.</strong> Naval
Base in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. The idea was to house prisoners taken in
what had already been labelled “the Global War on Terror” on a little
piece of “U.S.” soil beyond the reach of the American legal system and
whatever protections that system might afford anyone inside the country.
(If you wonder how the United States had access to a chunk of land on an
island nation with which it had the frostiest of relations, including
decades of economic sanctions, here’s the story: in 1903, long before
Cuba’s 1959 revolution, its government had granted the United States
“coaling” rights at Guantánamo, meaning that the U.S. Navy could
establish a base there to refuel its ships. The agreement remained in
force in 2002, as it does today.)</p>
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1510703330/ref=nosim/?tag=tomdispatch-20">
<div class="polaroid">
<img class="b" src="nuremberg-bc.png" alt="American Nuremberg by Rebecca Gordon" style="width:100%">
<div class="container"><p>Buy the Book!</p></div></div></a>
<p>In the years that followed, Guantánamo became the site of the <a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/2023/may/11/abu-zubaydah-drawings-guantanamo-bay-us-torture-policy">torture</a>
and even <a
href="https://harpers.org/archive/2010/03/the-guantanamo-suicides/">murder</a>
of individuals the U.S. took prisoner in Afghanistan, Iraq, and other
countries ranging from <a
href="https://www.therenditionproject.org.uk/prisoners/zubaydah.html">Pakistan</a>to
<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamedou_Ould_Slahi">Mauritania</a>.
Having written for more than 20 years about such U.S. torture programs
that <a
href="https://www.newsweek.com/time-think-about-torture-149445">began</a>
in <a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/21/lawsuit-muslims-september-11-roundup-abuse">October
2001</a>, I find today that I can’t bring myself to chronicle one more
time all the horrors that went on at Guantánamo or at CIA “black sites”
in countries ranging from Thailand to Poland, or at Bagram Air Base in
Afghanistan, or indeed at the Abu Ghraib prison and Camp NAMA (whose
motto was: “No blood, no foul”) in Iraq. If you don’t remember, just go
ahead and google those places. I’ll wait.</p>
<p>Thirty men remain at Guantánamo today. Some have never been tried.
Some have never even been charged with a crime. Their continued
detention and torture, including, as recently as 2014, punitive, brutal
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guantanamo_force_feeding">forced
feeding</a> for hunger strikers, confirmed the status of the United
States as a global scofflaw. To this day, keeping Guantánamo open
displays this country’s contempt for international law, including the
Geneva Conventions and the United Nations Convention against Torture. It
also displays contempt for our own legal system, including the
Constitution’s “<a
href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlevi">supremacy</a>”
clause which makes any ratified international treaty like the Convention
against Torture “the supreme law of the land.”</p>
<p>In February 2023, Fionnuala Ní Aoláin, the U.N.’s Special Rapporteur
on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms
while countering terrorism, became the first representative of the
United Nations ever permitted to visit Guantánamo. She was horrified by
what she found there, <a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/07/guantanamo-bay-un-visit-torture-treatment?CMP=GTUS_email&amp;utm_source=pocket_saves">telling</a>
the <em>Guardian</em> that the U.S. has</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“a responsibility to redress the harms it inflicted on its Muslim
torture victims. Existing medical treatment, both at the prison camp in
Cuba and for detainees released to other countries, was inadequate to
deal with multiple problems such as traumatic brain injuries, permanent
disabilities, sleep disorders, flashbacks, and untreated post-traumatic
stress disorder.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“These men,” she added, “are all survivors of torture, a unique crime
under international law, and in urgent need of care. Torture breaks a
person, it is intended to render them helpless and powerless so that
they cease to function psychologically, and in my conversations both
with current and former detainees I observed the harms it caused.”</p>
<p>The lawyer for one tortured prisoner, <a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/16/ammar-al-baluchi-guantanamo-bay-torture">Ammar
al-Baluchi</a>, reports that al-Baluchi “suffers from traumatic brain
injury from having been subjected to ‘walling’ where his head was
smashed repeatedly against the wall.” He has entered a deepening
cognitive decline, whose “symptoms include headaches, dizziness,
difficulty thinking and performing simple tasks.” He cannot sleep for
more than two hours at a time, “having been sleep-deprived as a torture
technique.”</p>
<p>The United States, Ní Aoláin insists, must provide rehabilitative
care for the men it has broken. I have my doubts, however, about the
curative powers of any treatment administered by Americans, even
civilian psychologists. After all, two of them personally <a
href="https://www.salon.com/2018/09/18/holding-the-line-on-torture_partner/">designed
and implemented</a> the CIA’s torture program.</p>
<p>The United States should indeed foot the bill for treating not only
the 30 men who remain in Guantánamo, but others who have been released
and continue to suffer the long-term effects of torture. And of course,
it goes without saying that the Biden administration should finally <a
href="https://www.closeguantanamo.org/">close that illegal prison
camp</a> — although that’s not likely to happen. Apparently it’s easier
to <a
href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/08/31/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-end-of-the-war-in-afghanistan/">end
an entire war</a> than decide what to do with 30 prisoners.</p>
<h4>Unlawful Weapons</h4>
<p>The United States is an outlier in another arena as well: the
production and deployment of arms widely recognized as presenting an
immediate or future danger to non-combatants. The U.S. has steadfastly
resisted joining conventions outlawing such weaponry, including cluster
bombs (or more euphemistically, “cluster munitions”) and landmines.</p>
<p>In fact, the United States deployed cluster bombs in its wars in
Iraq, and Afghanistan. (In the previous century, it dropped <a
href="https://www.npr.org/2023/07/10/1186824634/the-impact-of-cluster-bombs">270
million</a> of them in Laos alone while fighting the Vietnam War.)
Ironically — one might even say, hypocritically — the U.S. <a
href="http://www.stopclustermunitions.org/en-gb/cluster-bombs/use-of-cluster-bombs/in-syria.aspx">joined</a>
146 other countries in condemning Syrian and Russian use of the same
weapons in the Syrian civil war. Indeed, former White House press
secretary Jen Psaki <a
href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66134663">told
reporters</a> that if Russia were using them in Ukraine (as, in fact, <a
href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/05/29/cluster-munition-use-russia-ukraine-war">it
is</a>), that would constitute a “war crime.”</p>
<p>Now the U.S. has sent cluster bombs to Ukraine, supposedly to fill a
crucial gap in the supply of artillery shells. Mind you, it’s not that
the United States doesn’t have enough conventional artillery shells to
resupply Ukraine. The problem is that sending them there would leave
this country unprepared to fight <a
href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/can-the-world-make-enough-artillery-shells-to-keep-the-ukraine-war-going">two
simultaneous (and hypothetical) major wars</a> as envisioned in what the
Pentagon likes to think of as its readiness doctrine.</p>
<p>What are cluster munitions? They are artillery shells packed with
many individual bomblets, or “submunitions.” When one is fired, from up
to 20 miles away, it spreads as many as 90 separate bomblets over a wide
area, making it an excellent way to kill a lot of enemy soldiers with a
single shot.</p>
<p>What places these weapons off-limits for most nations is that not all
the bomblets explode. Some can stay where they fell for years, even
decades, until as a <em>New York Times</em> editorial <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/10/opinion/cluster-munitions-ukraine-biden.html?searchResultPosition=1">put
it</a>, “somebody — often, a child spotting a brightly colored,
battery-size doodad on the ground — accidentally sets it off.” They can,
in other words, lie in wait long after a war is over, sowing farmland
and forest with deadly booby traps. That’s why then-Secretary General of
the United Nations Ban Ki-moon once spoke of “the world’s collective
revulsion at these abhorrent weapons.” That’s why 123 countries have
signed the 2008 <a href="https://www.clusterconvention.org/">Convention
on Cluster Munitions</a>. Among the holdouts, however, are Russia,
Ukraine, and the United States.</p>
<p><a
href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66134663">According</a>
to National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, the cluster bombs the U.S.
has now sent to Ukraine each contains 88 bomblets, with, according to
the Pentagon, a failure rate of under 2.5%. (Other sources, however,
suggest that it could be <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/07/us/cluster-weapons-duds-ukraine.html">14%
or higher</a>.) This means that for every cluster shell fired, at least
two submunitions are likely to be duds. We have no idea how many of
these weapons the U.S. is supplying, but a Pentagon spokesman in a <a
href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66134663">briefing</a>
said there are “hundreds of thousands available.” It doesn’t take much
mathematical imagination to realize that they present a real future
danger to Ukrainian civilians. Nor is it terribly comforting when
Sullivan <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/10/opinion/cluster-munitions-ukraine-biden.html?searchResultPosition=1">assures
the world</a> that the Ukrainian government is “motivated” to minimize
risk to civilians as the munitions are deployed, because “these are
their citizens that they’re protecting.”</p>
<p>I for one am not eager to leave such cost-benefit risk calculations
in the hands of any government fighting for its survival. That’s
precisely why international laws against indiscriminate weapons exist —
to prevent governments from having to make such calculations in the heat
of battle.</p>
<p>Cluster bombs are only a subset of the weapons that leave behind
“explosive remnants of war.” Landmines are another. Like Russia, the
United States is not found among the 164 countries that have signed the
<a href="https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/ottawasigs">1999 Ottawa
Convention</a>, which required signatories to stop producing landmines,
destroy their existing stockpiles, and clear their own territories of
mines.</p>
<p>Ironically, the U.S. routinely donates money to pay for mine
clearance around the world, which is certainly a good thing, given the
legacy it left, for example, in Vietnam. <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/06/opinion/sunday/ban-land-mines.html?action=click&amp;module=RelatedLinks&amp;pgtype=Article">According</a>
to the <em>New York Times</em> in 2018:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Since the war there ended in 1975, at least 40,000 Vietnamese are
believed to have been killed and another 60,000 wounded by American land
mines, artillery shells, cluster bombs and other ordnance that failed to
detonate back then. They later exploded when handled by scrap-metal
scavengers and unsuspecting children.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Hot Enough for Ya?</h4>
<p>As I write this piece, <a
href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2023/07/12/heat-wave-forecast-arizona-texas-southwest/">about
one-third</a>of this country’s population is living under heat alerts.
That’s 110 million people. A heatwave <a
href="https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/italy-health-warning-europe-heatwave-saturday-intl/index.html">is
baking Europe</a>, where 16 Italian cities are under warnings, and
Greece has closed the Acropolis to prevent tourists from dying of heat
stroke. This summer looks to be worse in Europe than even last year’s
record-breaker when heat killed <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/10/climate/heat-waves-europe-deaths.html">more
than 60,000</a> people. In the U.S., too, heat is by far the greatest
weather-related killer. Makes you wonder why Texas Governor Greg Abbott
<a
href="https://www.businessinsider.com/texas-heat-wave-workers-greg-abbott-mandated-water-breaks-law-2023-7">signed
a bill</a> eliminating required water breaks for outside workers, just
as the latest heat wave was due to roll in.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, New York’s Hudson Valley and <a
href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/07/13/vermont-flooding-rainfall-warming-climate/">parts
of Vermont</a>, including its capital Montpelier, were inundated this
past week by a once-in-a-hundred-year storm, while in South Korea,
workers raced to rescue people whose cars were trapped inside <a
href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-66209578">the completely
submerged</a> Cheongju tunnel after a torrential monsoon rainfall.
Korea, along with much of Asia, expects such rains during the summer,
but this year’s — like so many other weather statistics — have been
literally off the charts. Journalists have finally experienced a sea
change (not unlike the <a
href="https://climate.copernicus.eu/record-breaking-north-atlantic-ocean-temperatures-contribute-extreme-marine-heatwaves">extraordinary
change</a> in surface water temperatures in the Atlantic Ocean). Gone
are the tepid suggestions that climate change “may play a part” in
causing extreme weather events. Reporters around the world now simply
assume that’s our reality.</p>
<p>When it comes to confronting the climate emergency, though, the
United States has once again been bringing up the rear. As far back as
1992, at the United Nations Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, President
George H.W. Bush resisted setting any caps on carbon-dioxide emissions.
As the <em>New York Times</em> <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/11/world/earth-summitbush-rio-president-has-uncomfortable-new-role-taking-hard-line-earth.html">reported</a>
then, “Showing a personal interest on the subject, he singlehandedly
forced negotiators to excise from the global warming treaty any
reference to deadlines for capping emissions of pollutants.” And even
then, Washington was resisting the efforts of poorer countries to wring
some money from us to help defray the costs of their own environmental
efforts.</p>
<p>Some things don’t change all that much. Although President Biden
reversed Donald Trump’s move to pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate
accords, his own climate record has been a combination of two steps
forward (the green energy transition funding <a
href="https://www.epa.gov/green-power-markets/summary-inflation-reduction-act-provisions-related-renewable-energy">found</a>
in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, for example) and a big step back
(<a
href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/14/politics/willow-project-oil-alaska-explained-climate/index.html">greenlighting</a>
the ConocoPhillips Willow oil drilling project on federal land in
Alaska’s north slope, not to speak of Senator Joe Manchin’s <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/30/climate/mountain-valley-pipe.html">pride
and joy</a>, the $6.6 billion Mountain Valley Pipeline for natural
gas).</p>
<p>And when it comes to remediating the damage our emissions have done
to poorer countries around the world, this country is still a day late
and billions of dollars short. In fact, on July 13th, climate envoy John
Kerry <a
href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-under-no-circumstances-will-pay-into-loss-damage-fund-kerry-2023-07-13/">told</a>
a congressional hearing that “under no circumstances” would the United
States pay reparations to developing countries suffering the devastating
effects of climate change. Although at the U.N.’s COP 27 conference in
November 2022, the U.S. did (at least in principle) support the creation
of a fund to help poorer countries ameliorate the effects of climate
change, as Reuters <a
href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-under-no-circumstances-will-pay-into-loss-damage-fund-kerry-2023-07-13/">reported</a>,
“the deal did not spell out who would pay into the fund or how money
would be disbursed.”</p>
<h4>Welcome to Solastalgia</h4>
<p>I learned a new word recently, <a
href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18027145/">solastalgia</a>. It
actually <em>is</em> a new word, created in 2005 by Australian
philosopher Glenn Albrecht to describe “the distress that is produced by
environmental change impacting on people while they are directly
connected to their home environment.” Albrecht’s focus was on Australian
rural indigenous communities with centuries of attachment to their
particular places, but I think the concept can be extended, at least
metaphorically, to the rest of us whose lives are now being affected by
the painful presences (and absences) brought on by environmental and
climate change: the presence of unprecedented heat, fire, <a
href="https://new.nsf.gov/news/noise-light-pollution-affect-breeding-habits-birds">noise,
and light</a>; the presence of deadly rain and flooding; and the <a
href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/images-antarcticas-doomsday-glacier-show-melting-below/story?id=97269226">growing
absence</a> of ice at the earth’s poles or on its <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furtwängler_Glacier">mountains</a>.
In my own life, among other things, it’s the loss of <a
href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/fireflies-tips-to-protect-from-threats">fireflies</a>
and the almost infinite sadness of rarely seeing more than a few faint
<a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/may/27/light-pollution-threatens-to-make-stars-invisible-within-20-years">stars</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, the “best country in the world” wasn’t the only nation
involved in creating the horrors I’ve been describing. And the ordinary
people who live in this country are not to blame for them. Still, as
beneficiaries of this nation’s bounty — its beauty, its aspirations, its
profoundly injured but still breathing democracy — we are, as the
philosopher Iris Marion Young <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Responsibility-Justice-Oxford-Political-Philosophy/dp/0195392388">insisted</a>,
<em>responsible</em> for them. It will take organized, collective
political action, but there is still time to bring our outlaw country
back into what indeed should be a united community of nations
confronting the looming horrors on this planet. Or so I hope and
believe.</p>
