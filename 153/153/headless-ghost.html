<p class="intro">This story is my dog Duque's fault. If Duque hadn't found those
footprints...But it would be better to start at the beginning.</p>
<p>It was a Monday and I was on my way to school. That day was very good
in school. The English teacher was absent so we had almost an hour extra
for recreation break. When I got home Duque wasn't there. I looked
inside and outside, on the back porch and the front patio. Then I went
out on the street to look for him. Finally I found him in the abandoned
house next door barking at something. I called him but he didn't come. I
whistled and he didn't come. I rolled on the floor and he didn't come.
<em>How strange,</em> I thought. <em>Whenever I roll on the floor he
comes running and jumps on top of me</em>. I went back home and asked my
dad to let me put a leash on Duque. My dad doesn't like to put a leash
on him. I went back to the abandoned house where I finally got the leash
on him and brought him home.</p>
<p>That was a very good week in school.
Some teacher was always absent and we had a lot of recreation
breaks.</p>
<p>On Saturday when I got up Duque wasn't there again. In fact he hadn't
there every morning, but because I didn't have to go to school that day,
I could find out what he was barking at. I went to the abandoned house
next door and saw someone running towards the back of the house. It was
white, like phosphorescent. It looked like a ghost or something like
that. I ran behind Duque to see what it was. When we reached the back of
the house there was nothing, nothing, nothing.</p>
<p>I returned home dragging Duque with the leash. In the patio I petted
Pinky, another dog we have. Duque doesn't like me to pet Pinky, it makes
him jealous. I went inside and petted Merlin, my cat. Duque is white and
black, with some brown. Pinky is gray, white and black. And Merlin is
all white.</p>
<p>That evening we had ravioli for dinner, which I don't like, so I
grabbed an apple and went upstairs to my room and lay down on the bed to
read. I was reading a "Goosebumps" book by R. L. Stine. It was called
"Ghost Beach". In it the author wrote that dogs can smell ghosts. At
that moment I heard Duque barkin g and remembered what happened that
morning. Then I did it: I took a bunch of shirts, tied them together and
threw them out the window like a rope. I didn't realize that I was
making the mistake of my life.</p>
<p>I went down the "rope" to the patio and prayed that Pinky wouldn't
see me because she might bark. Luckily she didn't see me.</p>
<p>When I got to the abandoned house I didn't see Duque, but I saw his
tracks and making like Sherlock Holmes I followed them. I came to a
muddy place and saw a wall with a hole in it,<br />
but only a dog could pass through. "That's where Duque went," I thought,
"but he was following that guy. Where could they have gone?"</p>
<p>I looked and looked all around but didn't find anything. I was about
to leave when I saw footprints, this time human ones. They were going
towards...of course! They went out the window, then on to the roof, then
to the wall and to the other side.</p>
<p>I went the same way and when I got to the other side I followed
Duque's tracks. They were easier to follow now because he had walked in
mud. I followed them until... do you know where? .. to the cemetery. I
was afraid to go in. I had heard a lot of stories about the cemetery.
But my stupid curiosity won again. I went into the cemetery and.. and
there was Duque. I tried to catch him by his collar, but he ran off.
Suddenly he stopped and I stood face to face with what looked like a
ghost. Duque began to bark. I remembered what I had read. It was a
ghost, I was sure now, because it had no head. I couldn't stand any more
and I shrieked so loud they must have heard it back at my house. The
ghost pressed me against a tombstone. I tried to kick it but my foot
passed right through it.</p>
<p>"How come you can hold me if I can't kick you?" I asked.</p>
<p>The ghost only laughed and said, "I have my ghostly secrets."</p>
<p>"And how did you leave footprints if you're a ghost?"</p>
<p>The ghost laughed again and said, "That was easy. I took shoes,
muddied them and pressed them against the wall."</p>
<p>"And why is your head missing?"</p>
<p>"That's a looong story, but if you insist I'll tell it to you as the
last thing you'll hear in your life... I was a rich merchant. I was
very, very rich, but greedy and evil."</p>
<p>This is beginning to sound like a fairy tale, I thought.</p>
<p>"I was so evil that one day when a servant annoyed me..."</p>
<p>"What did he do to you?"</p>
<p>"I don't remember, but I told another servant to stick a knife in
him. And he did. When the police came I denied everything. But my
servant confessed and they sent me to the guillotine and that's why I
have no head. OK, now it's time for you to die."</p>
<p>But the ghost didn't realize that while he was so enthusiastically
telling his story, I had freed one hand. With this hand I threw a stone
which bounced against a tomb stone, making a noise. The ghost turned
around to see what it was and I freed the other hand. Then I broke away
and ran, but something grabbed my pants leg. I stopped and turned around
and tell Duque to let me go and I realized that the thing holding me
wasn't exactly Duque. I saw a green hand holding my ankle. <em>Just what
I need: zombies</em>, I thought. Luckily, zombies aren't transparent and
Duque bit his hand.</p>
<p>I kept running and finally reached the cemetery exit. It was getting
light and I remembered another book I had read where it said that ghosts
can't stand the light. I saw the ghost fall to the ground.</p>
<p>My parents were awake when I arrived home. The asked me where I went
and said that they had been very worried. I said that I had taken an
early walk. Then my dad said that tomorrow we were moving. "Hurry up and
pack.<br />
It's already time to go to bed. Tomorrow you have to get up early."</p>
<p>I finished packing and went to bed. <em>Tomorrow will be a big
day</em>, I thought.</p>
<p>Today I woke up at six in the morning, I think, because I don't know
if the VCR clock is correct. I put my bags in the car and got in. When
Mom and Dad finished loading all the things, including the animals, we
left for our new home.</p>
<p>When we arrived Duque, Merlin and Pinky jumped out of the car. The
new house is very large and has an enormous living room.</p>
<p>Strange, I thought, looking out the window, <em>there's an abandoned
house next door here too</em>.</p>
<p>At first it was hard to adapt, but after a few days I was already
playing with the kids at school. Three weeks went by and they were good
weeks, until one day I came home from school and Duque wasn't there. I
looked inside and outside, on the back porch and the front patio...</p>
