<h3>The Secret Gospel of Thomas</h3>


<p><strong>Published 2003 by Random House, New York</strong></p>

<main>
<p class="intro">Elaine Pagels, professor of religion at Princeton University, became
famous – well, at least well known – with the publication of her book,
<em>The Gnostic Gospels, </em>in 1979. She has written several other
books as well on the history of Christianity, establishing her as the
foremost popular scholar in the field.</p>

<p><em>Beyond Belief</em>, published in 2003 by Random House, is a sort
of sequel to The Secret Gospels, in that it incorporates the new
scholarship that has come to light since that book was published. Since
Ms. Pagels’ infant son was diagnosed with fatal pulmonary hypertension,
her pursuit of knowledge about who Jesus really was has become a
question of personal urgency for her. This need is reflected in the text
and transforms the book into much more than a scholarly treatise for the
curious. She wants to know what Christ meant to his followers before
doctrine and dogmas, in other words, before Christianity was invented by
the Church.</p>

<p>The discovery of the Gospel of Thomas, along with other early
Christian texts, offers revealing clues. Pagels compares Thomas’s gospel
(which claims to give Jesus’ secret teaching, and indicates an affinity
with the Kabbalah) with the canonic texts to show how the early Church
chose to include some gospels and exclude others from the collection we
know as the New Testament – and why. During the time of persecution of
Christians, the church fathers constructed the canon, creed and
hierarchy, suppressing many of its spiritual resources in the process,
in order to avoid conflict with Roman law and religion.</p>

<p>A prime example is the label of heresy attached to the Gospel of
Thomas, and its subsequent suppression. If a copy hadn’t been found by
accident (or destiny?) in the caves of Nag Hammadi, along with many
other documents during the middle of the twentieth century, we’d have
never even known of its existence. Such secret writings had been
denounced by Irenaeus, bishop of Lyon (c.180) as “an abyss of madness,
and blasphemy against Christ.” Pagels had therefore expected to find
madness and blasphemy in these texts, but when she first studied them in
Harvard graduate school she found the contrary in sayings such as this
from Thomas. “Jesus said: <em>If you bring forth what is within you,
what you will bring forth will save you. If you do not bring forth what
is within you, what you do not bring forth will destroy you</em>. Pagels
found that “..the strength of this saying is that it does not tell us
what to believe but challenges us to discover what lies hidden within
ourselves; and, with a shock of recognition, I realized that this
perspective seemed to me to be self-evidently true.”</p>

<p>However, certain church leaders from the second through the fourth
centuries rejected many of these sources of revelation and constructed
instead the New Testament gospel canon of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John,
which has defined Christianity to this day. The Gospel of John is of
special importance in church dogma, and its basic tenets seem to be in
direct opposition to Thomas. John says that he writes “so that you may
<em>believe</em>, <em>and believing</em> may have life in [Jesus’]
name.” Thomas’s gospel, however, encourages us not so much to
<em>believe in Jesus, </em>as John demands, as to <em>seek to know God
</em>through one’s own, divinely given capacity, since all are created
in the image of God. “For Christians of later generations, the Gospel of
John helped provide a foundation for a unified church, which Thomas,
with its emphasis on each person’s search for God, did not.”</p>

<p>According to Pagels, John is the only evangelist who actually states
that Jesus is God incarnated. But not only Pagels says so. In one of his
commentaries on John, Origen – a church father, (c.240)  - writes that
while the other gospels describe Jesus as human, “none of them clearly
spoke of his divinity, as John does.” One may object that the other
three, synoptic (“seeing together”) gospels call Jesus “son of God”, and
this is virtually the same thing. But such titles (son of God, messiah)
in Jesus’ time designated human, not divine roles. When translated into
English fifteen centuries later, these were capitalized – a linguistic
convention that does not occur in the original Greek. When all four
gospels, together with Paul’s letters, were united in the New Testament
(c. 160 to 360) most Christians had come to read all four through John’s
lens, that Jesus is “Lord and God”.</p>

<p>Pagels feels that if the Gospel of Thomas were included in the New
Testament instead of that of John, or even if it were included along
with John, the development of Christianity would have been quite
different. Whereas Mark, Matthew and Luke identify Jesus as God’s human
agent, John and Thomas characterize him as God’s own light in human
form. Both claim to reveal, at least to a certain extent, Jesus’ “secret
teachings”, and assume that their readers are already familiar with the
synoptic gospels.</p>

<p>Despite their similarities, John and Thomas point the secret
teachings in sharply different directions. John claims that we can
experience God only through the divine light embodied in Jesus, while
Thomas says that the divine light embodied in Jesus is already shared by
humanity since we are all made “in the image of God”. Thomas thus
expresses what would become a central theme of Jewish, and later
Christian, mysticism a thousand years later: that the “image of God” is
hidden within everyone, and it is a question of recognizing this and
finding it through one’s own efforts.      </p>

<p>(On the question of Jesus’ divinity, Rudolf Steiner – not consulted
by Pagels –  offered an interesting solution: that Jesus was indeed a
human being, but that “a god”, Christ, incarnated in him at the moment
of baptism in the Jordan.) </p>

<p>At one point in her description of the dispute among the early
Christians about who Jesus really was, Pagels quotes Mark: <em>…he asked
his disciples, “Who do people say that I am?” And they told him, “John
the Baptist; and others say Elijah; and others, one of the prophets.“
And he asked them, “But who do you say that I am?” Peter answered him,
“You are the messiah.” </em>In view of this passage, it has always
seemed contradictory to me the contention that Christianity – and
Judaism – do not embrace the idea of reincarnation, even reject it, when
these first Jewish Christians seem to act as though it were common
knowledge.</p>

<p>The synoptic gospels claim that Jesus’ teaching predicted the coming
of the kingdom of God some time in the future, an interpretation still
adhered to by many Christians. However, both John and Thomas say
something different, the latter very specifically: Jesus said, <em>If
those who lead you say to you, ‘Look, the kingdom is in the sky’, then
the birds of the sky will get there before you….If they say to you, ‘It
is in the sea,’ then the fish will get there before you. </em>And:
<em>His disciples said to him, ‘When will the resurrection of the dead
come, and when will the new world come?’ He said to them, ‘What you look
forward to has already come, but you do not recognize it.’ </em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>Though the Gospel of Luke includes an alternative version of the same
idea (“…the kingdom of God is within you”), Luke later retreats from
this position and concludes with the apocalyptic warning that the Son of
Man is not a divine presence in us all but a terrifying judge.</p>

<p>A century ago Leo Tolstoy, in his monumental <em>The Kingdom of God
is Within you</em>, urged Christians to give up coercion and violence in
order to realize God’s kingdom here and now. Thomas Merton, the
twentieth century writer and Trappist monk, agreed with Tolstoy but
interpreted his kingdom mystically rather then practically. We are
confronted here with the Catholic church’s insistence that humanity is
sinful, base and unworthy <em>by nature</em> and that salvation from the
pangs of hell is only possible through faith in Jesus and, by obvious
extension, his church, and his representative on earth, the pope. But
the Gospel of Thomas leaves spiritual destiny up to each individual.
There Jesus treats us as equals, or at least as struggling siblings:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“According to Thomas, Jesus rebukes those who seek access to God
elsewhere, even—perhaps especially—those who seek it by trying to
“follow Jesus” himself. When certain disciples plead with Jesus to “show
us the place where you are, since it is necessary for us to seek it,” he
does not bother to answer so misguided a question and redirects the
disciples away from themselves toward the light hidden within each
person: ‘There is light within a person of light, and it lights up the
whole universe; If it does not shine, there is darkness.’ In other
words, one either discovers the light within that illuminates ‘the whole
universe’ or lives in darkness, within and without.”  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Finally, after so many centuries, the heretics are having their say.
Another most interesting document found at Nag Hammadi is the Gospel of
Philip, who explains baptism. Sometimes the person who receives baptism
“receives the holy spirit…this is what happens when one experiences a
mystery.” Divine grace, this implies, isn’t sufficient; the initiate’s
capacity for spiritual understanding is also a factor. “Faith is our
earth, in which we take root; hope is the water through which we are
nourished; love is the air through which we grow; <em>gnosis</em> is the
light through which we become fully grown.</p>
