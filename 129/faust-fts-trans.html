	                    <p>The sun resounds as once of old<br>
	                    In loving spheres of motley song,<br>
	                    Predestined is its journey bold,<br>
	                    Ripening as it flows along.<br>
	                    Its sight the angels new strength gives,<br>
	                    Though none can fathom how its done;<br>
	                    The inconceivable still lives<br>
	                    In glory as when the days were one.</p>

	                    <p>How marvelously right<br>
	                    The splendiferous earth revolves,<br>
	                    It interchanges heaven's light<br>
	                    With dismal darkness unresolved,<br>
	                    It churns the seas and violent rivers<br>
	                    through rocky soil in convolution,<br>
	                    and rocks and seas apart are driven<br>
	                    In swift eternal revolution.</p>

	                    <p style="font-weight:bold">MICHAEL</p>

	                    <p>And storms complete with briny bluster<br>
	                    From sea to land and land to sea,<br>
	                    Forge a chain from fury's fluster<br>
	                    That binds the world in harmony.<br>
	                    A fearful bolt of lightning's flame<br>
	                    Precedes the devastating thunder;<br>
	                    But angels worthy of the name<br>
	                    Revere in awe each daily wonder.</p>

	                    The inconceivable still lives<br>

	                    <p>Since you, O Lord, approach us once again<br>
	                    And ask us how our work is getting on,<br>
	                    And since I've given pleasure now and then,<br>
	                    You see me here debating with the throng.<br>
	                    My choice of words leaves much to be desired,<br>
	                    I'm subject to this circle's cruelest scorn;<br>
	                    You'd die laughing at pathos by me inspired,<br>
	                    If laughter were not a thing you'd long forsworn.<br>
	                    About the sun I've nothing to confess,<br>
	                    I only see how men are in a mess.<br>
	                    The god of earth is still his father's son,<br>
	                    As queer as when the days were one.<br>
	                    Somewhat better would he live<br>
	                    Had you forgot heaven's light to give.<br>
	                    His use of reason's minimal,<br>
	                    Lower than the lowest animal,<br>
	                    He seems to be, with permission of Your Grace,<br>
	                    A cricket jumping all around the place,<br>
	                    Who's always spinning and spinning springs,<br>
	                    and in the grass the same old lyric sings;<br>
	                    If only he'd molder in the grass<br>
	                    And not stick his nose in such morass.</p>

	                    <p style="font-weight:bold">THE LORD</p>

	                    <p>Have you nothing else to say?<br>
	                    Must you always arrogance display?<br>
	                    Doesn't anything on earth seem good to you?</p>

	                    <p style="font-weight:bold">MEPHISTOPHELES</p>

	                    <p>No Sir, I find things rotten through and through.<br>
	                    So sorry for humanity am I<br>
	                    That tormenting it almost makes me cry.</p>

	                    <p style="font-weight:bold">THE LORD</p>

	                    <p>Do you know Faust?</p>

	                    <p style="font-weight:bold">MEPHISTOPHELES</p>

	                    <p>The doctor?</p>

	                    <p style="font-weight:bold">THE LORD</p>

	                    <p>My servant.</p>

	                    <p style="font-weight:bold">MEPHISTOPHELES</p>

	                    <p>Of course. He serves you in a special way,<br>
	                    Keeping even food and drink at bay,<br>
	                    Confusion plays the devil with his mind.<br>
	                    Though knowing only fools would take such measures,<br>
	                    He asks that heaven show him orbs sublime<br>
	                    And earth provide him all its pleasures;<br>
	                    Not all that's high nor all that's low<br>
	                    Can satisfy his will to know.</p>

	                    <p style="font-weight:bold">THE LORD</p>

	                    <p>Although he serves me in some confusion,<br>
	                    I'll gladly show him soon the light.<br>
	                    The gardener knows that flowers in profusion<br>
	                    And fruit adorn his trees when all is ripe.</p>

	                    <p style="font-weight:bold">MEPHISTOPHELES</p>

	                    <p>What will you bet? You'll lose, you know,<br>
	                    If me you give permission<br>
	                    To lead him where he longs to go.</p>

	                    <p style="font-weight:bold">THE LORD</p>

	                    <p>As long as he's on earth alive,<br>
	                    So long it's not to you forbidden.<br>
	                    Men must err as long as they still strive.</p>

	                    <p style="font-weight:bold">MEPHISTOPHELES</p>

	                    <p>I thank you, Lord. I've never kept it hidden<br>
	                    That once they're dead I keep my distance,<br>
	                    It's rosy cheeks I love in every instance.<br>
	                    I'm not at home to corpses in my house,<br>
	                    I like to play the game of cat and mouse.</p>

	                    <p style="font-weight:bold">THE LORD</p>

	                    <p>All right, I give you leave to try it.<br>
	                    Seduce that spirit from its primal source<br>
	                    And guide it, should you find a way to beguile it,<br>
	                    Along the fearsome pitfalls of your course;<br>
	                    And stand disgraced when finally you admit:<br>
	                    A good man, in spite of iniquity's force,<br>
	                    Will find the path to truth before he's quit.</p>

	                    <p style="font-weight:bold">MEPHISTOPHELES</p>

	                    <p>Done! It won't take very long.<br>
	                    I have no doubt that I will win the bet,<br>
	                    And when I do, please don't forget the debt,<br>
	                    Allow my triumph its rightful measure.<br>
	                    Dust shall he eat, and with pleasure,<br>
	                    Just like the serpent, my celebrated pet.</p>

	                    <p style="font-weight:bold">THE LORD</p>

	                    <p>Even that you're free to try.<br>
	                    Your kind and you I've never hated,<br>
	                    Of all the spirits who me deny,<br>
	                    The rogue by me the least is rated.<br>
	                    The deeds of men are easily put to sleep,<br>
	                    They love their undisturb√©d rest.<br>
	                    That's why I give them over to his keep,<br>
	                    Who as the devil puts them to the test.<br>
	                    But you, true sons of God, enjoy<br>
	                    The living wealth of beauty's joy.<br>
	                    Let Being -- active and alive forever --<br>
	                    Embrace you in love's delightful folds.<br>
	                    Make fast the things that swerve and sever<br>
	                    With thought that steadfast holds.</p>

	                    <p style="font-weight:bold">MEPHISTOPHELES</p>

	                    <p>I enjoy seeing the Old One now and then<br>
	                    To make sure our rapport is never broken.<br>
	                    It's damned decent of Himself once again<br>
	                    In person with the Devil to have spoken.</p>

	<p>It was a time when I'd decided that my German was respectable enough to tackle Goethe's Faust. I bought a bilingual edition at a bookstore on Hamburger Allee in Frankfurt and dived in. I found it to be surprisingly easy to understand ‚Äì direct language, deep ideas salted with sly humor. But the English translation was disappointing, not only because of all the thees and thous ‚Äì so British, ya know old boy ‚Äì but also because it lacked the sting of true grit. So I decided to take a crack at it myself. I didn't get very far, just the Prologue in Heaven, but it at least showed me that I could have translated the whole damn thing if I had the time. After all, it took Goethe almost his whole life to write it and it would have taken me twice as long to translate both volumes with all the rhythms and rhymes.</p>
