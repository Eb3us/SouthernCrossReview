<h1>Trump or Biden on Israel?</h1>

<h3>It's No Contest</h3>

</header>

<main>
<p class="intro">Recently, I attended a demonstration called by groups opposing the
carnage in Gaza, where eight months of air, ground, and sea attacks by
the Israeli Defense Forces have leveled entire quadrants of cities and
killed more than 36,000 Palestinians. Many of the participants, justly
outraged by the ongoing mass murder triggered by Hamas’s October 7th
terrorist massacre, bitterly criticized President Biden over his
continuing support for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s war.</p>
<p>Asked about the likely choice in November between Biden and Donald
Trump, the consensus among the demonstrators was that they wouldn’t vote
for “Genocide Joe,” and that there was nothing to choose from between
Biden and Trump when it comes to Middle East policy. Some would simply
stay home, while some might vote for the Green Party or another third
party, and even those who might eventually pull the lever for Biden
pledged to vote “uncommitted” in any primary to “send a message to the
White House.”</p>
<p>Still, no matter the horrors — and they are horrors — of Gaza and of
the <a
href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/6/6/israeli-froces-raid-occupied-west-banks-jenin-kill-three-palestinians">low-intensity
war</a> Israel is also waging in the occupied West Bank, and despite
Israel’s regular artillery and bombing runs against targets in Lebanon,
Syria, Iraq, and even Iran, those who argue that there’s no difference
between Biden and Trump when it comes to Israel are deeply mistaken.</p>
<p>Biden represents a long-standing mainstream allegiance to Israel as
an American ally, but — like other former presidents, including George
H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and Barack Obama — he disdains Israel’s
extremist, pro-settler far right. And as he learned during the Obama
years, President Biden is all too aware that Netanyahu has long
explicitly thrown in his lot with the Republican Party and, more
specifically, with Donald Trump as its standard-bearer.</p>
<p>Trump, on the other hand — ever transactional, with distinctly <a
href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/12/07/electoral-logic-behind-trumps-antisemitism-00072661">bizarre
attitudes</a> toward American Jews and, in particular, Jewish supporters
of Israel — has gone out of his way to cultivate his connection to
Netanyahu and the most extreme wing of Israel’s governing parties. To
placate Christian Zionists, who comprise a substantial chunk <a
href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/01/28/trump-thinks-supporting-israel-means-letting-it-do-whatever-it-wants/">of
his base</a>, he’s donned the cloak of an uber-Zionist himself. During
his administration, in fact, he named his son-in-law Jared Kushner as
his Middle East “czar.” Kushner has lifelong ties to Netanyahu, who even
slept in his bedroom when Kushner was young. (“Jared Kushner once lent
Benjamin Netanyahu his bed,” is how the <em>Jerusalem Post</em>
<a
href="https://www.jpost.com/american-politics/when-netanyahu-slept-at-the-kushners-and-other-media-tales-of-trumps-jewish-confidantes-481486">put
it</a>.)</p>
<p>So, while pro-Palestinian demonstrators are focusing their anger on
Biden, they may, all too ironically, find themselves targeted for
deportation by Donald Trump, should he win a second term in office. “One
thing I do is, any student that protests, I throw them out of the
country,” <a
href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/05/27/trump-israel-gaza-policy-donors/">was</a>
his comment on the Gaza protests. “You know, there are a lot of foreign
students. As soon as they hear that, they’re going to behave.”</p>
<h4>Trump’s Record on Israel-Palestine</h4>
<p>As a television showman, playboy, and real-estate wheeler-dealer,
Trump wasn’t exactly an expert on Middle Eastern politics when he
lurched into his presidential campaign in 2016. His views on Israel were
then, at best, a work-in-progress, leading hard-core supporters of that
country to describe him as “<a
href="https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/rubio-campaign-press-release-fact-check-donald-trump-no-ally-israel">confused</a>.”
But having won the nomination, he quickly staked out a radical-right
position on the topic. The 2016 GOP platform, in fact, shattered a
long-standing bipartisan consensus by coming out against a two-state
solution in which the Palestinians would, sooner or later, get a state
of their own on territory occupied by Israel. “We reject the false
notion that Israel is an occupier,” <a
href="https://www.cnn.com/2016/07/11/politics/gop-platform-republican-convention-israel/index.html">declared</a>
that platform, a position that dovetailed perfectly with the views of
Israel’s ultra-right, including the ruling Likud Party, that the
occupied West Bank — which they refer to as “Judea and Samaria” —
belongs to Israel alone because of an ancient biblical heritage.</p>
<p>During the 2016 campaign, Trump’s principal advisers on Israel were
the previously obscure lawyer <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_M._Friedman">David M.
Friedman</a>, who had helped Trump <a
href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2016/12/david-friedman-israel-ambassador-pick-helped-trump-with-casino-debt.html">wriggle
out</a> of his casino bankruptcies, and <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Greenblatt">Jason
Greenblatt</a>, a real-estate lawyer with the Trump Organization.
Friedman would eventually become Trump’s ambassador to Israel and
Greenblatt, a senior White House official. “If Donald Trump wins the
White House, he’ll probably be the first U.S. president whose top
adviser on Israel used to do guard duty at a Jewish settlement in the
West Bank armed with an M-16 assault weapon,” <a
href="https://forward.com/news/breaking-news/338915/no-experience-necessary-meet-trumps-orthodox-israel-advisor/">wrote</a>
<em>The Forward</em>, a leading Jewish newspaper, referring to
Greenblatt. Both were outspoken supporters of expanding Jewish
settlements on the West Bank and allowing Israel to formally annex part
of it. Friedman had also <a
href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/03/09/politics/west-bank-friedman-beit-el/index.html">served</a>
as president of the nonprofit American Friends of Beth El (AFBE), which
had lavishly <a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/15/trump-israel-ambassador-david-friedman">funded</a>
a religious Jewish outpost near Jerusalem in Palestinian territory.</p>
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1620977915/ref=nosim/?tag=tomdispatch-20">

<p>Both of them, along with Jared Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump,
promoted moving the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, <a
href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44120428">which President
Trump indeed did</a>. That move, supported by radical-right Republicans,
many ultra-Orthodox Jews, and Christian Zionists, was a calculated
provocation of the Palestinians, and would be <a
href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-42250340">condemned</a>
by the Pope, the United Nations, and much of the world.</p>
<p>Throughout his presidency, Trump made it clear that he supported a
radical revision of U.S. policy toward the Israel-Palestine issue. In
2019, in a move that drew outrage and derision, Trump <a
href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-47697717">signed an
order</a> recognizing Israel’s illegal annexation of Syria’s Golan
Heights, seized in 1967. And later that year, in a political “gift” to
Netanyahu, Trump discarded decades of U.S. policy by <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/18/world/middleeast/trump-israel-west-bank-settlements.html">declaring</a>
that Israel’s massive project to build illegal settlements in the West
Bank did not violate international law. “We’ve recognized the reality on
the ground,” was the way Secretary of State Mike Pompeo put it.</p>
<p>In addition, the president unilaterally shut down the Washington
office of the Palestine Liberation Organization, while halting $200
million in direct U.S. aid to the Palestinian Authority and $300 million
owed to the United Nations Relief &amp; Works Agency (<a
href="https://www.unrwa.org/">UNRWA</a>), which supports Palestinian
refugees in the West Bank, Gaza, Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan.</p>
<p>Trump’s wrecking-ball approach to the Middle East culminated in
January 2020 when he and Netanyahu jointly released a “Middle East peace
plan” hammered out by Kushner, Friedman, Greenblatt, and <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avi_Berkowitz">Avi Berkowitz</a>
(plucked from the Kushner Companies with zero experience in the region).
Among other provisions, it <a
href="https://jstreet.org/its-not-a-peace-plan-its-an-annexation-smokescreen-trump-netanyahu/">green-lit</a>
Israeli annexation of the Jordan Valley and a web of illegal settlements
that house hundreds of thousands of Jewish occupiers. “Israel does not
have to wait at all,” <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_peace_plan#cite_note-6">said
Friedman</a>. “We will recognize it.” Released with great fanfare,
Trump’s peace plan drew worldwide <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_peace_plan#International_reactions">ridicule
and condemnation</a>, including by the European Union, the Arab League,
and <em>Haaretz</em>, a liberal Israeli daily, which <a
href="https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/2020-02-02/ty-article/.premium/how-trumps-deal-of-the-century-became-the-joke-of-the-century/0000017f-e17a-d75c-a7ff-fdff7d960000">termed
it</a> “the joke of the century.”</p>
<p>Finally, signaling that Trump and his family continue to have a
neo-colonial view of the region as turf for future hotel-building, in
the midst of the current war in Gaza Kushner proposed expelling its
Palestinian population and constructing a seaside resort there. “Gaza’s
waterfront property could be very valuable,” <a
href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/03/22/kushner-trump-israel-gaza-policy/">he
said</a>. “It’s a little bit of an unfortunate situation there, but from
Israel’s perspective, I would do my best to move the people out and then
clean it up.”</p>
<p>Moving the people out, of course, is a euphemism for exactly what
Israeli settlers have been doing to the Palestinians since 1948.</p>
<h4>Biden’s Lifelong Ties to Zionism</h4>
<p>Joe Biden’s constant reiteration of his <a
href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/04/28/readout-of-president-joe-bidens-call-with-prime-minister-netanyahu-of-israel-4/">support</a>
for the “ironclad” U.S.-Israeli alliance shouldn’t come as a surprise to
anyone who’s followed his career since 1973 as a senator, vice
president, and president. “I am a Zionist,” he proclaimed last December
at a White House Hanukkah gathering, noting that he’s been saying the
same thing <a
href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/12/11/remarks-by-president-biden-at-a-hanukkah-holiday-reception/">for
decades</a>. He’s long claimed that his support for Israel derives in
part from his father’s World War II-era understanding of the Nazi
Holocaust. He’s <a
href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/18/politics/golda-meir-joe-biden-what-matters/index.html">repeatedly
cited</a> — not always <a
href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/05/politics/fact-check-biden-meir-israel-war-liaison/index.html">accurately</a>
— his 1973 meeting with Israel’s Prime Minister Golda Meir as convincing
him that Israel was a vital refuge for Jews worldwide. Moreover, Biden
has long had the backing of Israel’s American supporters and donors.
According to Reuters, citing data from Open Secrets, during his 36 years
in the Senate (1973-2009), Biden was the number one recipient of <a
href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/i-am-zionist-how-joe-bidens-lifelong-bond-with-israel-shapes-war-policy-2023-10-21/">donations</a>
from pro-Israeli groups.</p>
<p>However, unlike Trump, Kushner, Friedman, and Greenblatt, closely
tied to Netanyahu and Israel’s extreme right, Biden (and the Democrats
more broadly) have been far more closely allied with mainstream and
center-left Israelis. They have, in fact, been engaged in a low-level
Cold War with Netanyahu ever since his rise to prominence in the 1990s.
In 1996, for instance, President Bill Clinton <a
href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/bill-clinton-admits-he-tried-to-help-peres-beat-netanyahu-in-1996-elections/">quietly
helped</a> Shimon Peres beat Netanyahu in an Israeli election.
Similarly, during Barack Obama’s presidency (and Joe Biden’s vice
presidency), the White House repeatedly <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/23/world/middleeast/israel-benjamin-netanyahu-barack-obama.html">clashed</a>
with Netanyahu, who did everything he could to undermine the president’s
successful <a
href="https://www.latimes.com/nation/la-fg-netanyahu-obama-iran-20150301-story.html">diplomacy</a>
with Iran, while <a
href="https://www.politico.com/story/2015/03/democrats-react-benjamin-netanyahu-speech-115705">insultingly</a>
accepting an invitation to address Congress without so much as a nod of
courtesy to the White House. That conflict culminated in a December 2016
<a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/23/world/middleeast/israel-settlements-un-vote.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=first-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news">decision</a>
by Obama not to veto a United Nations Security Council resolution
condemning Israel’s illegal West Bank settlements. (At the time,
President-elect Trump, along with his controversial national security
aide Lt. General Michael Flynn, tried to <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/22/world/middleeast/donald-trump-united-nations-israel-settlements.html">sabotage</a>
that vote.)</p>
<p>Despite that history of run-ins with Netanyahu, after Hamas invaded
Israel and wreaked havoc, murdering and kidnapping hundreds, President
Biden seemed remarkably unprepared for the ferocious Israeli
counterattack that quickly became a scorched-earth campaign in Gaza
killing tens of thousands, including thousands of children, and causing
at least <a
href="https://apnews.com/article/un-report-gaza-destruction-housing-economy-recovery-4f61dcca7db3fd5eb3da5c6a25001e12">$50
billion</a> in damage to that 25-mile strip of land so far. More than
half of Gaza’s structures have been <a
href="https://www.barrons.com/news/more-than-half-of-gaza-structures-destroyed-or-damaged-un-ef2b76dd?refsec=topics_afp-news">damaged
or destroyed</a>, including 24 <a
href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.ca/strikes-raids-and-incursions-seven-months-of-relentless-attacks-on-healthcare-in-palestine/#:~:text=According%20to%20OCHA%2C%2024%20hospitals,by%20less%20effective%2C%20improvised%20options.">hospitals</a>,

and four-fifths of its <a

Nearly two million Gazans are now homeless. Throughout this carnage,
Biden personally insisted on continuing to supply Israel with enormous
quantities of weaponry, including the <a
href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/03/29/us-weapons-israel-gaza-war/">2,000-pound
bombs</a> that Israel used to devastate whole city blocks. And for
months he fought Republicans in Congress to secure a massive military
aid package for Israel, Ukraine, and Taiwan.</p>
<p>Despite his past history, by bear-hugging Netanyahu while <a
href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/25/as-us-resists-ceasefire-calls-what-is-bidens-endgame-in-gaza">repeatedly</a>
<a
href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/11/18/biden-op-ed-gaza-cease-fire-00127935">opposing</a>
the <a
href="https://www.axios.com/2024/03/27/biden-un-ceasefire-vote-bipartisan-backlash">idea</a>
of a ceasefire and an end to the killing, Biden came to face a growing
revolt at home. Voters, especially young ones, as well as
Palestinian-Americans, Arab-Americans, and Muslims, began peeling away
from the Democrats and distancing themselves from the Biden reelection
campaign. Many liberal and left-leaning Jews, who normally would vote
Democratic in an overwhelming fashion, joined street demonstrations and
campus protests in favor of a ceasefire. And an ever-larger segment of
the Democratic Party’s elected officials, <a
href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/17/politics/senators-ceasefire-middle-east/index.html">including</a>
as many as two dozen senators, began pressing Biden to reverse course.
In March, in a speech that <a
href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/15/politics/schumer-israel-speech-analysis/index.html">CNN
said</a> “sent shockwaves from Washington to Jerusalem,” Senate Majority
Leader Chuck Schumer, the nation’s highest-ranking Jewish official,
demanded that Netanyahu step down.</p>
<p>You undoubtedly won’t be surprised to learn that, gradually,
trepidatiously, President Biden began changing course. In early March,
he warned Israel that he’d <a
href="https://www.politico.eu/article/us-biden-warns-red-line-israel-rafah-cyprus-aid-ship-gets-ready-open-humanitarian-sea-corridor-gaza/">set
a red line</a> opposing Israel’s plan for a massive invasion of the city
of Rafah in southern Gaza. “[We] can’t have another 30,000 Palestinians
dead,” he said. (As Israeli forces moved ever further into Rafah, that
“red line” seemed to go <a
href="https://apnews.com/article/rafah-biden-gaza-israel-hamas-war-2b13ba81805c4b7ad988f7959abc1a7a">missing
in action</a>.) A few weeks later, he hinted, and then confirmed, that
the delivery of a shipment of 2,000-pound bombs to Israel had been
“paused,” then <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/08/us/politics/biden-bombs-israel.html">halted</a>,
drawing <a
href="https://thehill.com/policy/defense/4652577-biden-gop-wrath-pause-bombs-israel/">fierce
denunciations</a> from the Trump-allied GOP but delivering an
unmistakable signal to the Israeli government. And in June, Biden
outlined a three-part peace plan for Gaza that, he insisted, originated
in discussions with Israeli leaders and was intended to box Netanyahu
into a schedule to wind down the conflict. “It’s time for this war to
end,” <a
href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/05/31/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-middle-east-2/">said
the president</a>.</p>
<p>And mind you, he did all of that, modest as it was, despite knowing
that many of the Democratic Party’s biggest pro-Israeli funders would
be, to say the least, peeved. Typically, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haim_Saban">Haim Saban</a>, an
Israeli-American billionaire who is one of the Democratic Party’s
biggest financial backers and <a
href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/pro-israel-megadonor-haim-saban-hosts-fundraiser-for-biden-doesnt-attend-after-testing-positive-for-covid/">hosted</a>
a February fundraiser in Los Angeles for Biden, reacted with outrage
over the president’s decision to partially halt the shipment of American
bombs to the Jewish state. “Bad, bad, bad decision on all levels,” he
wrote in a message to Biden, as <a
href="https://www.axios.com/2024/05/10/israel-gaza-biden-rafah-donors">Axios
reported</a>. “Let’s not forget that there are more Jewish voters, who
care about Israel, than Muslim voters that care about Hamas.” And Mark
Mellman, the CEO of the Democratic Majority for Israel, a well-funded,
prominent pro-Zionist organization (which, in February, had begun
running ads supporting Biden <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/23/us/politics/israel-biden-michigan-gaza.html">in
Michigan</a>) spoke out against the arms halt. “There are a lot of
people in the pro-Israel community who are very worried, very upset and
very angry,” he said, in a statement <a
href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/biden-donors-rage-pledge-pause-weapon-shipments-israel-bad-bad-bad-decision">reported
by Fox News</a>.</p>
<p>Undeterred by sporadic outbursts of opposition from hardcore,
pro-Israel American Jews, Biden went even further in an <a
href="https://time.com/6984968/joe-biden-transcript-2024-interview/">interview
with <em>Time</em></a><em> </em>magazine, saying
explicitly that Netanyahu was prolonging the war for political reasons —
that is, his own survival — and reiterating his support for a
Palestinian state.</p>
<p>It is, of course, fair to blame Biden for his egregious refusal to
rein in Israel’s brutalization of Gaza. Many of his critics argue that
Americans are, in fact, turning against Israel and that actions to cut
off Israel would be popular. Perhaps, but no one, including those
denouncing “Genocide Joe,” knows what political price Biden would have
paid, had he, say, suspended all military deliveries to Israel and
ordered his U.N. ambassador not to veto U.N. Security Council
resolutions condemning Israel’s war. At the very least, he would have
triggered thunderous broadsides from Trump, congressional Republicans,
and the massive domestic arsenal of pro-Israel supporters, including the
American Israel Public Affairs Committee (<a
href="https://www.aipac.org/">AIPAC</a>), the Democratic Majority for
Israel (<a href="https://demmajorityforisrael.org/">DMFA</a>), and the
ultra-right Republican Jewish Coalition (<a
href="https://www.rjchq.org/">RJC</a>). At the same time, it isn’t clear
that Biden would end up gaining significant additional support from
left-liberal voters who’d cheer such an action.</p>
<p>What is certain, however, is that, if reelected in November, Trump is
likely to renew his unqualified support for Israeli expansionism, not
only when it comes to annexing the West Bank and resettling Gaza but
also for a broader regional conflict that could unleash Israel against
Iran and its allies in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Yemen. Such a
catastrophic wider war could happen anyway, especially if Netanyahu
decides that the only way he can survive politically is to open a major
new <a
href="https://responsiblestatecraft.org/biden-netanyahu-israel-war-iran/">eastern
front</a>. So far, the Biden administration has, at least, worked hard
to <a
href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-iran-israel-netanyahu-g7-missiles-drone-62cba0eaac095115f8386397b3ded2f4">contain</a>
the current conflict. Count on one thing: Donald Trump, who unleashed a
campaign of <a
href="https://tomdispatch.com/handling-and-mishandling-the-iran-nuclear-program/">maximum
pressure</a> against Iran, wouldn’t have done so.</p>
<p>When it comes to the Middle East, the choice in November 2024 is
clear enough. If only it were better.</p>
