# The New Role of the Heart

*The long-established mechanistic dogma that the heart is a
pressure-propulsion pump that impels the blood, an inert fluid, is
beginning to lose ground in mainstream medicine.*

In a recent article[^1] published by an acclaimed peer-reviewed physiology journal, we presented evidence that the movement of the blood is primary, and the heart
"senses" and directs its distribution to the organs and thus plays only
a secondary role. As pointed out by Rudolf Steiner, the blood can be
seen as "materialized" warmth, a physical expression of the will whose
very nature is activity, i.e., movement. This has been confirmed by
observations on embryonic circulation, where the blood circulates before
the functional integrity of the heart is achieved. Not only does the blood, a liquid organ,[^2] move autonomously in response to the metabolic demands of the tissues,
but it also possesses greater vitality than any other organ. For
example, banked blood can be transfused for up to 6 weeks, as compared
to a kidney or the heart, which need to be implanted into a recipient
within 48 and 5 hours, respectively, after procurement. In as much as
the blood in warm-blooded animals is an expression of the group-soul of
a given species, human blood circulating in the vertical direction is
the expression of an individualized human spirit. We can say that the
very nature of blood within an organism is movement, and if, for any
reason, its mobility is limited, it becomes prone to clotting.

Nature's water cycle is an apt image of "autonomous" circulation. Water
rises as vapor, condenses into drops, and rains to the ground. The
transition of water between aggregate states, i.e., vapor and liquid is
caused by taking up and releasing of warmth. This is a fundamental
process that plays a key role in the maintenance and renewal of the
earth's life body, also known as the biosphere. Similarly, the sum of
human body water (blood, lymph, interstitial, and intracellular fluid)
is subject to incessant movements effected by metabolic warmth.
Collectively, the total amount of water in the human body, estimated to
be about 75% of the body weight, is the carrier of the formative forces
also known as the *"*life body" or "etheric
body."[^3]
Blood, consisting of protein-rich plasma and red blood cells (RBCs), is
a further transformation of the etheric body and the bearer of the human
self or the
"I".[^4]
With 4-6 millions of RBCs per cubic millimeter, the RBCs outnumber all
other types of cells in the body! RBCs are filled with hemoglobin, an
iron containing pigment which binds oxygen in the lung and delivers it
by way of the arterial blood to the tissues for the support of cellular
respiration. The venous blood, on the other hand, transports carbon
dioxide, a toxic byproduct of tissue metabolism, to be exhaled by the
lung. Not unlike water in outer nature, the blood alternates between the
life-filled, oxygen-laden "light" condition striving towards the
periphery, and the carbon dioxide-laden "heavy" state seeking the
center.

Conventional physiology, lacking the concept of a life or etheric body,
ascribes the circulation of the blood solely to the pumping action of
the heart. The movement of tissue fluids, by contrast, is attributed to
changes in temperature and concentration of solutes. However, no cogent
explanation exists for the circulation of bile and the movement of
lymph, cerebrospinal fluid, and numerous other substances. The origin of
this blind spot in physiology is rooted in physics and can be traced to
Galileo, Newton, Descartes, and their followers, who, with the advent of
an intellectual

conception of the world, lost the feeling for the cosmic dimensions of
earthly phenomena. They reduced the four-element Aristotelian
physics,[^5] of which the ethers were still an integral part, to three states of
matter -- solid, liquid, and gas. Warmth, the fourth state that
permeates and transforms them all and forms the bridge between the
physical and the etheric, was simply ascribed to hypothetical atomic
motion. Atomistic thinking, the bedrock of the materialistic world
conception, originated with Greek philosophers, most notably Democritus
and Epicurus. It resurfaced with the advent of the consciousness soul
age in the 15th century and continues to this day. (Of note, in an
effort to expose this trend in science, Rudolf Steiner wrote his first scientific essay[^6] on the refutation of atomism, at the age of 21!) The inevitable result
of this reductionist approach to nature was that only what can be
"measured and weighed," i.e., the "centric" forces, such as gravity,
pressure, electricity, magnetism, etc., were accepted by physics and
physiology, whereas the activities, that is, their etheric counterparts,
remained unrecognized.

All kingdoms of nature, including humans, are subject to centric forces
as well as to forces of the periphery, namely, to warmth, light,
chemical or tone, and life ethers. The ethers reach us through the skin,
the senses, and our breath. In the process, they activate our own
individualized life or etheric forces. Spiritual scientific research
shows that the sum of etheric forces in our organism manifests as
negative pressure or suction.[^7] The existence of negative pressure in the chest (which prevents the collapse of the lungs), at the center of blood vortices in the heart,
and in tissue spaces throughout the body is well-recognized in
physiology. However, the fact that collectively this constitutes a
"force-field" is not acknowledged. The existence of this field has now
been proposed as the actual cause of blood's movement from the periphery
to the heart. Its primary field of action is the smallest vessels, the
capillaries. Thus, as in any circular motion, two opposing sets of
forces are connected with blood's movement, namely, the centrifugal and
centripetal. The former is active in the arterial pressure maintained by
the left ventricle, and the latter manifests as suction.

### Physiology of Freedom

The assertion that the blood circulates is not quite accurate. Rather,
the blood moves in lemniscates and, as such, is a reflection of the
planetary movements as described by Steiner in the Astronomy
Course.[^8]
The heart is placed at the crossing point between the greater (systemic)
and the lesser (lung) circulations and, like the sun, can be seen as a
dynamic pivot point ceaselessly balancing the two. In that sense, the
heart and the vital organs above and below the heart represent the inner
solar
system.[^9]

The statement that "the heart is not a pump" is similarly incorrect
because a hydraulic ram, by which the physical principle of the heart's
action can be demonstrated, is a type of pump driven by the momentum of
flowing water. The heart is therefore "activated" by the blood, and its
rhythmic movement is the expression of the macrocosmic soul/spirit
forces that reach it by way of the senses and of the "earthly" forces
streaming to it from the movement-metabolic system.

It is known that the heart expends only about 15-20% of its energetic
demands on contraction and expansion, with the balance (some 80%!)
converted into warmth. To date, no rational explanation has been
advanced as to why the heart should generate so much heat. It has even
been suggested that the heart simply is an "inefficient pump." For
comparison, the efficiency[^10] of an internal combustion engine is about 30-35%, significantly higher than that of the heart. The answer to this physiological riddle can only
be given by occult physiology, namely, that the warmth of the heart serves as a *bridge*[^11] between the soul-spiritual and the etheric-physical constitution of the
human being. It is the gateway by which sense impressions from the outer
and inner world, memories, judgments, and karmic impulses are joined
with our I, made "our own."

At long last, the heart has been freed of a task it does not perform,
burdened upon it by mechanistic thinking, and which, at any rate, is
physically impossible. How could an organ the size of a fist push blood,
a relatively viscous fluid (2-3 times greater than water), through an
estimated 50,000 km of blood vessels, mostly consisting of capillaries
(1011), many with diameters that are smaller than the red blood cells!
It may still take some time before physiologists discover that, in
addition to the numerous functions the heart is known to perform, it is
the organ of the soul and the agent of destiny. But, at the very least,
the door has been opened towards a future, more human physiology.
