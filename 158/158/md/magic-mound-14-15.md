### Chapter 14

### Cross the River at a Run

They soon learned that Sergio\'s precaution not to stop on the path was
justified. They had no sooner finished eating when a squad of soldiers
armed with spears and maces came along the path.

\"What a waste of time,\" one of them said, \"marching all day and night
without finding them.\"

\"I\'m glad we didn\'t,\" said another, \"I\'d rather not meet up with
that white monster.\" He meant Platero, who was standing stock still
behind a boulder a few yards away.

\"Maybe the squad that went to guard the Eastbridge found them.\"

\"Or they already crossed into Maxanatara.\"

\"That Gleb said they went this way to the Westbridge, but I don\'t
trust him.\"

\"Neither do I, he gives me the creeps.\"

After the soldiers passed and could no longer be heard Sergio said,
\"That was close, but at least we know now that the Westbridge exists.

\"But those soldiers are going there,\" Divino said. \"How will we get
across it?\"

\"We\'ll worry about that when we come to it. It looks like they\'re
more afraid of us than we are of them.\"

\"They\'re afraid of Platero.\" When the donkey heard his name he raised
his soulful eyes and they had to laugh at him being considered a
monster.

\"Come on, you two, let\'s get moving,\" Sergio said.

They traveled rapidly but cautiously, being careful to keep enough
distance between them and the soldiers. The boys took turns riding on
Platero, who did not mind at all. When the sun set each day they
stopped, pitched their camp at a distance from the path, ate their
frugal meal and slept. The next morning they breakfasted and set out
before dawn. They continued going westward until one day shortly after
breaking camp they came to a high ridge topped by a rock that had the
shape of an bear. The trail went around the ridge, but Sergio decided to
climb up to have a look while Divino and Platero waited below.

When Sergio reached the top he hid behind the stone bear and signaled to
the others to be quiet and come up. Sergio pointed down when Divino was
alongside him. There far below was the rushing river still cloaked in
semi-darkness, for the sun had not yet risen over the ridge. On the near
bank the soldiers lay sleeping under dark blankets. They saw no sentry.

\"Where\'s the bridge?\" Divino whispered

\"It might be under the water, like a ford.\"

\"How do you know?\"

\"I don\'t, but it\'s on the map below the bear and the soldiers are
camped there.\"

\"What are we going to do?\"

This was what Sergio had been thinking about as he waited for the others
to reach him: \"Cross the river at a run.\"

\"Like the raven said!\" Divino exclaimed.

\"Shh!\"

Sergio led them to the other side of the stone bear, the side facing the
river, keeping under cover as much as possible. Platero\'s hoofs were
impossible to silence completely, but the donkey seemed to understand
the problem. He stepped along delicately, avoiding rock surfaces
whenever he could. Finally Sergio dared go no farther for fear that the
soldiers would hear them. He mentally measured the distance to the river
and looked at the peak of the ridge behind them, where the sun would be
rising at any moment.

\"Listen,\" he whispered, \"here\'s what we\'ll do.\" Divino listened
breathlessly for his brother\'s instructions. \"We\'ll both mount
Platero. Then, when the sun rises over that ridge and casts its light on
the soldiers, we charge.\"

\"Charge?\"

\"Yes, it\'s our only chance. When they are woken suddenly by our
cries...\"

\"What will we cry?\"

\"I don\'t know, anything. What\'s important is that the soldiers will
be so shocked to see us charging them on this monster with the sun at
our backs blinding them, that by the time they can collect themselves we
should be over the river.\"

\"Without a bridge?\"

\"I told you, the bridge must be under the surface of the water,\"
Sergio insisted, hoping fervently that he was right.

\"Cross the river at a run,\" Divino repeated to himself.

\"Come on, let\'s mount,\" Sergio urged, \"the sun is rising.\"

They sat on Platero\'s back and silently waited for the sun\'s signal.
Then it came. In a matter of seconds the sun rose brilliantly pink over
the rim of the ridge and sent its long fingers of light down the slope
and onto the river.

\"Now!\" Sergio cried and Platero leaped forward and down the slope of
the ridge as fast as he could run without falling.

\"Yell something!\" Sergio shouted back to Divino.

\"Ya, ya!\" Divino screamed, \"Cross the river run..to Mireya.. ya, ya,
Dona Ute! Dona Ute!..ya,ya,ya\...\"

The soldiers woke abruptly and stared in anguish at the terrifying
spectacle bearing down on them in a stream of blinding light. They
sprang to their feet and ran for their lives. Platero carried the boys
over the river in a splashing clattering of hoofs. Once on the other
side they didn\'t stop until they had reached the edge of a forest which
was about a hundred yards from the river. They looked back and saw to
their horror that the soldiers had returned and two of them were about
to cross. Sergio pulled his brother and Divino into the forest.

\"Let\'s run, Sergio.\"

\"No, wait.\"

\"The two soldiers stepped warily into the swiftly rushing water up to
their knees. They looked back at the others and an officer brandished a
spear at them forcing them to go on. Their narrow eyes, set in square
ugly faces, concentrated on the river. Suddenly one of them was up to
his armpits. He grabbed his companion\'s hand for help. The other tried
to wrench free, but he was dragged into the strong current and they were
both swept downstream. The boys saw their heads go under. The remaining
soldiers turned and headed quickly back in the direction of Arman\'s
castle.

\"What happened?\" Divino asked. \"They tried to cross at the same place
we did.\"

\"But they didn\'t cross at a run as we did,\" Sergio said. \"Let\'s get
moving before the others change their minds.\"

\"Which way should we go. There\'s no path here.\"

\"There\'s a path on the map. We\'ll just have to find it.\" Sergio
looked at the sun in the northeast. \"South,\" he said, and they started
off through the forest.

Chapter 15

Fly above the Chasm High

The forest in Maxlabora was like the one in Maxanatara, which meant that
it was pleasant and hospitable and the boys were glad to be in it
instead of struggling through the gray frigid mountains of Urmaxa. They
found a path of sorts, but it was so overgrown and faint that they
weren\'t sure it was a path at all. As they penetrated deeper the forest
came alive with the same kind of animals they had seen in Maxnatara, and
they somehow felt more alive themselves. They walked on till well past
noon until Sergio finally gave the signal to stop and rest. The boys
picked fruit from the trees while Platero busied himself grazing the
juicy abundant grass.

\"We must think of what to do next,\" Sergio said. \"There\'s no point
in going on aimlessly.\"

\"It\'s too bad Tamoshot isn\'t here to guide us,\" Divino said.

\"The second line of the raven\'s verse was *Fly above the chasm
high*,\" Sergio said softly, as though to himself.

\"What\'s a chasm?\" Divino asked.

\"A very deep ditch.\"

\"Oh, we already passed that. Didn\'t you see it?\"

\"Sergio, who had been resting calmly against a tree-trunk, jumped to
his feet, startling Platero and Divino. \"Where?\" he asked Divino.

\"I didn\'t know it was a chasm,\" Divino replied apologetically. \"It
was back there on the right side. We passed it about an hour ago. I saw
it through the trees and thought you wanted to avoid it so we wouldn\'t
fall in.\"

Sergio untied his silver belt and put it into one of the saddle-bags.
Divino took his off and put it in the other saddle-belt. \"We have to go
back to 0that chasm, so we might as well start now,\" Sergio said and
began walking back they way they had come. Divino sighed. \"Come on,
Platero, we\'ve got to backtrack.\"

\"You should have told me about the chasm,\" Sergio said without looking
back. Divino agreed, for they would have saved two hours walking if he
had.

They walked what seemed more than a hour but saw no chasm. \"Are you
sure you saw it?\" Sergio asked irritably.

\"Yes, Sergio, I swear I did.\"

\"Well, where is it?\"

\"*To find you must seek, m\'boys. That\'s life.*\"

The voice came from behind them. Divino ran to Sergio\'s side. \"What
was that?\" he asked. But Sergio was looking over his brother\'s
shoulder into the forest. \"There it is.\" Through a small opening in
the underbrush they saw a space and a chasm. It was visible only when
they faced south. \"*Come in, lads, and bring your mighty steed. It\'s
only me, yer old friend, Tamoshot.\"*

Platero walked towards the chasm. \"Be careful, Platero,\" Divino cried,
\"you\'ll fall in.\" The donkey disappeared. The boys heard him bray and
then Tamoshot\'s booming laugh: \"Hello there, Platero, old steed. Yer
the smartest o\' the lot.\"

Sergio and Divino approached the chasm mystified. Then they realized
that it wasn\'t a chasm after all, only a picture of one. Behind the
picture Tamoshot lay with his head resting on a tree root. Platero stood
over him as if to say, \"I saw through your trick. Any donkey can tell a
real chasm from a picture of one.\" The brothers stared at the little
man. He stood up and tied his silver cord around his waist.

\"The tararobe is a fine garment, boys. It\'s changed me life. In fact
I\'d swear it\'s taken ten years off me life.\" His eyes twinkled. \"You
didn\'t know I was an artist, did you? I painted this picture in three
hours.\" He put his hands an his hips and admired the painted chasm.
\"Pretty, isn\'t it? It has a practical purpose as well. I knew you\'d
be comin\' along here eventually and you\'d never see the chasm, so the
only thing for it was to show you where it is. But then I thought: what
about me sleep. I confess I\'ve not yet got used to sleeping at night,
despite me tararobe. So I put the chasm here where you\'d see it and
wake me up.\"

He yawned and squinted at the sun. \"My, it\'s taken you a long while to
get here.\"

Sergio preferred not to mention his having missed the picture. \"That\'s
not a real chasm, Tamoshot. What are you talking about?\"

\"What\'s real and what isn\'t real? Who\'s to say?\" Tamoshot replied,
\"but I know what you mean. The real chasm is up there a few leagues.\"
He pointed through the forest with a gnarled finger, picked up his
knapsack and started off in that direction. Platero seemed to have
formed an attachment to the old man, for he followed him without being
told. The boys went after them.

\"Aren\'t you going to take the picture you painted, Mr. Tamoshot?\"
Divino asked him.

\"Too bulky to carry around and if I ever need another, which is
extremely unlikely, I\'ll just paint it again. There\'s no lack of tree
bark here to paint on and none of plants and flowers to make paints.\"

\"You make your own paints?\" Sergio said.

\"Sure, that\'s half the fun. Besides there aren\'t many paint stores
around here as far as I can see, so I haven\'t much choice.\" He laughed
heartily at his own joke and the boys laughed with him. Only Platero did
not join them for animals cannot laugh, which doesn\'t mean they don\'t
feel the laughter inside.

The chasm was not far but Tamoshot was right when he said they would
never have found it. It was behind a low hill that extended to the north
and south as far as they could see and it was not shown on their map.
The boys climbed the hill after Tamoshot and Platero and stood beside
them. They looked down into a chasm which seemed to have no bottom, at
least they saw none for no light reached its depths.

Tamoshot was speaking but they could hardly hear him over the roar of
the wind that rose from the chasm. He shouted: \"Alaram\'s camp is on
the other side of the chasm, far to the south.\"

\"How do we get across the chasm, Mr. Tamoshot?\" Divino asked.

\"Ah yes, how?\"

\"How did Alaram and Mireya and the rest get across?\" asked Sergio.

Instead of answering, Tamoshot picked up a twisted branch from the
ground and threw it over the chasm. It started to fall but the roaring
wind snatched it up, twirled it in the air up and across the chasm and
finally dropped it on the other side where it bounced twice and lay
still.

\"Fly above the chasm high,\" Sergio shouted.

\"Eh, what\'s that you say?\" Tamoshot asked.

\"That\'s what the raven said,\" Divino answered him. \"But we can\'t
fly.\"

Tamoshot squatted and began to write or draw with his finger in the
dust. The boys looked but understood nothing of the lines and curves
being etched by Tamoshot\'s long finger. Suddenly Sergio understood the
meaning of the raven\'s words, and he shivered. \"What is it?\" Divino
asked him.

\"The raven meant we should fly over the chasm carried by the wind.
Isn\'t that right, Tamoshot?\"

But the little man continued to scratch the earth with his head down.
Sergio turned to his brother. \"We don\'t have to do it. We can turn
back.\"

Divino frowned and bit his lip. \"The raven was right about running
across the river,\" he said.

\"Yes, he was right about that.\" He felt divino\'s and Platero\'s eyes
on him and knew he would have to decide. He also knew that if he decided
to give up he would never forgive himself.

\"I\'ll go first,\" he finally said. \"If I make it to the other side
you can follow, If I don\'t you can go back with Platero and Tamoshot.\"

\"But Sergio,\" Divino said with anguish, \"even if we do get to the
other side, what about Platero?\" He seemed more concerned about having
to leave the donkey behind than about the danger of flying across the
bottomless chasm without wings.

Sergio spoke firmly over the wind: \"He will have to stay behind.
Tamoshot will look after him.\" The little man had not changed his
posture. He seemed to be in another world, cut off from the deeds and
fears of others.

Sergio walked to the edge of the chasm. \"Remember, Divino,\" he called
back, \"If I don\'t make it across go back to Maxanatara.\"

\"He silently prayed a prayer that Dona Ute had taught them:

*Sun and earth, friends forever,*

Wind and sea, leave us never,

*Keep us safe, keep us whole,*

With your help we\'ll reach our goal.

* *And he jumped into the void.

At first he fell down as the branch had, but the wind rising from the
depths filled his tararobe with air and lifted him high over the chasm
and twisted him around like a top. He had closed his eyes when he
started to drop and when he felt himself rising he opened them. The
earth and sky spun around and made him dizzy so he closed his eyes again
and became part of the howling wind, rising, falling, rising again,
spinning over the jutting jaws of the chasm. After what seemed an
eternity, the wind dropped him with a hard bump on the other side. He
opened his eyes and saw the cloudless sky above him. When he realized
that he was lying on his back he jumped to his feet but his head spun
and he had to sit down.

Divino did not wait for his brother to tell him what to do. Before
Sergio\'s head had cleared he jumped over the edge of the chasm and was
soon spinning over it inside his inflated tararobe. He landed in a bush
on the other side, which made for a softer landing that Sergio\'s had
been. He was not too dizzy but his heart beat like a drum.

The two boys stood at their edge of the chasm and waved to Platero and
Tamoshot. Platero held his head high, an uncomfortable position for a
donkey, and sniffed the wind. Tamoshot was still tracing signs in the
dust and did not look at them. Platero started to walk away from the
chasm with his head down and his tail between his legs. After about ten
yards he stopped and stood still for a few moments. Then he turned and
faced the chasm again. Donkeys are stubborn animals and seldom change
their minds, but Platero was an uncommon donkey. He kicked his hind legs
in the air, brayed as loudly as he could and rushed the chasm at full
gallop. His legs continued to churn furiously in the air as we went over
the edge and down, straight down into the depths.

The boys cried with one voice: \"PLATERO!\" The donkey, who wore no
tararobe of course, only plunged deeper into the chasm until the could
see him no more. Divino thought his heart would burst and it might have
if a moment later he had not seen Platero rise up from the darkness,
high over the chasm in its very center, spin once, twice, three times in
the air and sail over their heads. The wind set him down gently behind
them. His legs had never stopped running so when he touched the earth he
continued to gallop until Sergio called to him to stop. The boys ran
across the barren ground that separated the chasm from a dense forest
and Platero turned to meet them. They fell on his neck and kissed and
hugged him until he shook himself and they fell to the ground on either
side of him. They laughed until they almost cried. Finally Platero
butted each of them as if to say: \"That\'s enough of that, let\'s get
going again.\"

\"*Fare ye well, young friends!*\"

They turned and saw Tamoshot standing on the other side of the chasm
smiling and waving.

\"Aren\'t you coming, Mr. Tamoshot?\" Divino called.

\"Ho, ho, no, no. Too old to learn to fly. Good luck and don\'t forget
the raven\'s words.\" He turned and walked jauntily away.

They shouted goodbye and thanks and when would they see him again, but
the strange little man never looked back.

\"We better go into the forest,\" Sergio said. \"or we\'ll melt in this
sun.\"

\"And I\'m hungry,\" Divino announced. \"I hope there\'s good fruit
around here.\"

They marched into the forest with renewed confidence after having
conquered the chasm. If they had known what lay before them their
confidence would have been considerably less pronounced.
