# The Prophet\

![](pushkin-image.jpeg){class="a"}

## By Alexander Pushkin\

My spirit wracked by thirst for grace,\
I wandered in a darkling land\
Till at a crossing of the ways\
I saw a six-wing\'d Seraph stand.\
With fingers light as dream at night\
He brushed mine eyes and they grew bright\
Opening unto prophecies\
Wild as a startled eaglet\'s eyes.\
He touched mine ears. Then noise and sound\
Poured into me from all around:\
I heard the shudders of the sky,\
The sweep of angel hosts on high,\
The creep of beasts below in the seas,\
The seep of sap in valley trees.\
Then leaning to my lips he wrung\
Thereout my sinful little tongue\
Of guile and idle caviling;\
And with his bloody fingertips\
He set between my wasting lips\
A Serpent\'s wise and forkèd sting.\
And with his sword he cleft my chest\
And ripped my quaking heart out whole,\
And in my sundered breast he pressed\
A blazing shard of living coal.\
There in the desert I lay dead\
Until the voice from heaven said:\
\"Arise O Prophet! Work My will,\
Thou that hast now perceived and heard.\
On land and sea thy charge fulfill\
And burn Man\'s heart with this My Word.\"

**Alexander Sergeyevich Pushkin** 6 June 1799 -- 10 February 1837) was a
Russian poet, playwright, and novelist of the Romantic era. He is
considered by many to be the greatest Russian poet, as well as the
founder of modern [Russian
literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_literature). He
published his first poem at the age of 15, and was widely recognized by
the literary establishment by the time of his graduation from the
[Tsarskoye Selo
Lyceum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsarskoye_Selo_Lyceum). Upon
graduation from the Lycée, Pushkin recited his controversial poem \"[Ode
to Liberty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ode_to_Liberty_(poem))\", one
of several that led to his exile by Emperor [Alexander
I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_I_of_Russia). While under
strict surveillance by the political police and unable to publish,
Pushkin wrote his most famous play, [*Boris
Godunov*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Godunov_(play)). His novel
in verse [*Eugene Onegin*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Onegin)
was serialized between 1825 and 1832. Pushkin was fatally wounded in a
[duel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duel) with his wife\'s alleged
lover, [Georges-Charles de Heeckeren
d\'Anthès](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges-Charles_de_Heeckeren_d%27Anthès),
also known as Dantes-Gekkern, a French officer serving with the
Chevalier Guard Regiment.
