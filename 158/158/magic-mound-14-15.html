      <h3>Chapter 14</h3>

      <h3>Cross the River at a Run</h3>
    </header>

    <main>
      <p class="intro">
        They soon learned that Sergio's precaution not to stop on the path was
        justified. They had no sooner finished eating when a squad of soldiers
        armed with spears and maces came along the path.
      </p>
      <p>
        "What a waste of time," one of them said, "marching all day and night
        without finding them."
      </p>
      <p>
        "I'm glad we didn't," said another, "I'd rather not meet up with that
        white monster." He meant Platero, who was standing stock still behind a
        boulder a few yards away.
      </p>
      <p>"Maybe the squad that went to guard the Eastbridge found them."</p>
      <p>"Or they already crossed into Maxanatara."</p>
      <p>
        "That Gleb said they went this way to the Westbridge, but I don't trust
        him."
      </p>
      <p>"Neither do I, he gives me the creeps."</p>
      <p>
        After the soldiers passed and could no longer be heard Sergio said,
        "That was close, but at least we know now that the Westbridge exists.
      </p>
      <p>
        "But those soldiers are going there," Divino said. "How will we get
        across it?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "We'll worry about that when we come to it. It looks like they're more
        afraid of us than we are of them."
      </p>
      <p>
        "They're afraid of Platero." When the donkey heard his name he raised
        his soulful eyes and they had to laugh at him being considered a
        monster.
      </p>
      <p>"Come on, you two, let's get moving," Sergio said.</p>
      <p>
        They traveled rapidly but cautiously, being careful to keep enough
        distance between them and the soldiers. The boys took turns riding on
        Platero, who did not mind at all. When the sun set each day they
        stopped, pitched their camp at a distance from the path, ate their
        frugal meal and slept. The next morning they breakfasted and set out
        before dawn. They continued going westward until one day shortly after
        breaking camp they came to a high ridge topped by a rock that had the
        shape of an bear. The trail went around the ridge, but Sergio decided to
        climb up to have a look while Divino and Platero waited below.
      </p>
      <p>
        When Sergio reached the top he hid behind the stone bear and signaled to
        the others to be quiet and come up. Sergio pointed down when Divino was
        alongside him. There far below was the rushing river still cloaked in
        semi-darkness, for the sun had not yet risen over the ridge. On the near
        bank the soldiers lay sleeping under dark blankets. They saw no sentry.
      </p>
      <p>"Where's the bridge?" Divino whispered</p>
      <p>"It might be under the water, like a ford."</p>
      <p>"How do you know?"</p>
      <p>
        "I don't, but it's on the map below the bear and the soldiers are camped
        there."
      </p>
      <p>"What are we going to do?"</p>
      <p>
        This was what Sergio had been thinking about as he waited for the others
        to reach him: "Cross the river at a run."
      </p>
      <p>"Like the raven said!" Divino exclaimed.</p>
      <p>"Shh!"</p>
      <p>
        Sergio led them to the other side of the stone bear, the side facing the
        river, keeping under cover as much as possible. Platero's hoofs were
        impossible to silence completely, but the donkey seemed to understand
        the problem. He stepped along delicately, avoiding rock surfaces
        whenever he could. Finally Sergio dared go no farther for fear that the
        soldiers would hear them. He mentally measured the distance to the river
        and looked at the peak of the ridge behind them, where the sun would be
        rising at any moment.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Listen," he whispered, "here's what we'll do." Divino listened
        breathlessly for his brother's instructions. "We'll both mount Platero.
        Then, when the sun rises over that ridge and casts its light on the
        soldiers, we charge."
      </p>
      <p>"Charge?"</p>
      <p>
        "Yes, it's our only chance. When they are woken suddenly by our cries…"
      </p>
      <p>"What will we cry?"</p>
      <p>
        "I don't know, anything. What's important is that the soldiers will be
        so shocked to see us charging them on this monster with the sun at our
        backs blinding them, that by the time they can collect themselves we
        should be over the river."
      </p>
      <p>"Without a bridge?"</p>
      <p>
        "I told you, the bridge must be under the surface of the water," Sergio
        insisted, hoping fervently that he was right.
      </p>
      <p>"Cross the river at a run," Divino repeated to himself.</p>
      <p>"Come on, let's mount," Sergio urged, "the sun is rising."</p>
      <p>
        They sat on Platero's back and silently waited for the sun's signal.
        Then it came. In a matter of seconds the sun rose brilliantly pink over
        the rim of the ridge and sent its long fingers of light down the slope
        and onto the river.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Now!" Sergio cried and Platero leaped forward and down the slope of the
        ridge as fast as he could run without falling.
      </p>
      <p>"Yell something!" Sergio shouted back to Divino.</p>
      <p>
        "Ya, ya!" Divino screamed, "Cross the river run..to Mireya.. ya, ya,
        Dona Ute! Dona Ute!..ya,ya,ya..."
      </p>
      <p>
        The soldiers woke abruptly and stared in anguish at the terrifying
        spectacle bearing down on them in a stream of blinding light. They
        sprang to their feet and ran for their lives. Platero carried the boys
        over the river in a splashing clattering of hoofs. Once on the other
        side they didn't stop until they had reached the edge of a forest which
        was about a hundred yards from the river. They looked back and saw to
        their horror that the soldiers had returned and two of them were about
        to cross. Sergio pulled his brother and Divino into the forest.
      </p>
      <p>"Let's run, Sergio."</p>
      <p>"No, wait."</p>
      <p>
        "The two soldiers stepped warily into the swiftly rushing water up to
        their knees. They looked back at the others and an officer brandished a
        spear at them forcing them to go on. Their narrow eyes, set in square
        ugly faces, concentrated on the river. Suddenly one of them was up to
        his armpits. He grabbed his companion's hand for help. The other tried
        to wrench free, but he was dragged into the strong current and they were
        both swept downstream. The boys saw their heads go under. The remaining
        soldiers turned and headed quickly back in the direction of Arman's
        castle.
      </p>
      <p>
        "What happened?" Divino asked. "They tried to cross at the same place we
        did."
      </p>
      <p>
        "But they didn't cross at a run as we did," Sergio said. "Let's get
        moving before the others change their minds."
      </p>
      <p>"Which way should we go. There's no path here."</p>
      <p>
        "There's a path on the map. We'll just have to find it." Sergio looked
        at the sun in the northeast. "South," he said, and they started off
        through the forest.
      </p>
      <h3>Chapter 15</h3>
      <h3>Fly above the Chasm High</h3>
      <p class="intropoem">
        The forest in Maxlabora was like the one in Maxanatara, which meant that
        it was pleasant and hospitable and the boys were glad to be in it
        instead of struggling through the gray frigid mountains of Urmaxa. They
        found a path of sorts, but it was so overgrown and faint that they
        weren't sure it was a path at all. As they penetrated deeper the forest
        came alive with the same kind of animals they had seen in Maxnatara, and
        they somehow felt more alive themselves. They walked on till well past
        noon until Sergio finally gave the signal to stop and rest. The boys
        picked fruit from the trees while Platero busied himself grazing the
        juicy abundant grass.
      </p>
      <p>
        "We must think of what to do next," Sergio said. "There's no point in
        going on aimlessly."
      </p>
      <p>"It's too bad Tamoshot isn't here to guide us," Divino said.</p>
      <p>
        "The second line of the raven's verse was
        <em>Fly above the chasm high</em>," Sergio said softly, as though to
        himself.
      </p>
      <p>"What's a chasm?" Divino asked.</p>
      <p>"A very deep ditch."</p>
      <p>"Oh, we already passed that. Didn't you see it?"</p>
      <p>
        "Sergio, who had been resting calmly against a tree-trunk, jumped to his
        feet, startling Platero and Divino. "Where?" he asked Divino.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I didn't know it was a chasm," Divino replied apologetically. "It was
        back there on the right side. We passed it about an hour ago. I saw it
        through the trees and thought you wanted to avoid it so we wouldn't fall
        in."
      </p>
      <p>
        Sergio untied his silver belt and put it into one of the saddle-bags.
        Divino took his off and put it in the other saddle-belt. "We have to go
        back to 0that chasm, so we might as well start now," Sergio said and
        began walking back they way they had come. Divino sighed. "Come on,
        Platero, we've got to backtrack."
      </p>
      <p>
        "You should have told me about the chasm," Sergio said without looking
        back. Divino agreed, for they would have saved two hours walking if he
        had.
      </p>
      <p>
        They walked what seemed more than a hour but saw no chasm. "Are you sure
        you saw it?" Sergio asked irritably.
      </p>
      <p>"Yes, Sergio, I swear I did."</p>
      <p>"Well, where is it?"</p>
      <p>"<em>To find you must seek, m'boys. That's life.</em>"</p>
      <p>
        The voice came from behind them. Divino ran to Sergio's side. "What was
        that?" he asked. But Sergio was looking over his brother's shoulder into
        the forest. "There it is." Through a small opening in the underbrush
        they saw a space and a chasm. It was visible only when they faced south.
        "<em
          >Come in, lads, and bring your mighty steed. It's only me, yer old
          friend, Tamoshot."</em
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Platero walked towards the chasm. "Be careful, Platero," Divino cried,
        "you'll fall in." The donkey disappeared. The boys heard him bray and
        then Tamoshot's booming laugh: "Hello there, Platero, old steed. Yer the
        smartest o' the lot."
      </p>
      <p>
        Sergio and Divino approached the chasm mystified. Then they realized
        that it wasn't a chasm after all, only a picture of one. Behind the
        picture Tamoshot lay with his head resting on a tree root. Platero stood
        over him as if to say, "I saw through your trick. Any donkey can tell a
        real chasm from a picture of one." The brothers stared at the little
        man. He stood up and tied his silver cord around his waist.
      </p>
      <p>
        "The tararobe is a fine garment, boys. It's changed me life. In fact I'd
        swear it's taken ten years off me life." His eyes twinkled. "You didn't
        know I was an artist, did you? I painted this picture in three hours."
        He put his hands an his hips and admired the painted chasm. "Pretty,
        isn't it? It has a practical purpose as well. I knew you'd be comin'
        along here eventually and you'd never see the chasm, so the only thing
        for it was to show you where it is. But then I thought: what about me
        sleep. I confess I've not yet got used to sleeping at night, despite me
        tararobe. So I put the chasm here where you'd see it and wake me up."
      </p>
      <p>
        He yawned and squinted at the sun. "My, it's taken you a long while to
        get here."
      </p>
      <p>
        Sergio preferred not to mention his having missed the picture. "That's
        not a real chasm, Tamoshot. What are you talking about?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "What's real and what isn't real? Who's to say?" Tamoshot replied, "but
        I know what you mean. The real chasm is up there a few leagues." He
        pointed through the forest with a gnarled finger, picked up his knapsack
        and started off in that direction. Platero seemed to have formed an
        attachment to the old man, for he followed him without being told. The
        boys went after them.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Aren't you going to take the picture you painted, Mr. Tamoshot?" Divino
        asked him.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Too bulky to carry around and if I ever need another, which is
        extremely unlikely, I'll just paint it again. There's no lack of tree
        bark here to paint on and none of plants and flowers to make paints."
      </p>
      <p>"You make your own paints?" Sergio said.</p>
      <p>
        "Sure, that's half the fun. Besides there aren't many paint stores
        around here as far as I can see, so I haven't much choice." He laughed
        heartily at his own joke and the boys laughed with him. Only Platero did
        not join them for animals cannot laugh, which doesn't mean they don't
        feel the laughter inside.
      </p>
      <p>
        The chasm was not far but Tamoshot was right when he said they would
        never have found it. It was behind a low hill that extended to the north
        and south as far as they could see and it was not shown on their map.
        The boys climbed the hill after Tamoshot and Platero and stood beside
        them. They looked down into a chasm which seemed to have no bottom, at
        least they saw none for no light reached its depths.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tamoshot was speaking but they could hardly hear him over the roar of
        the wind that rose from the chasm. He shouted: "Alaram's camp is on the
        other side of the chasm, far to the south."
      </p>
      <p>"How do we get across the chasm, Mr. Tamoshot?" Divino asked.</p>
      <p>"Ah yes, how?"</p>
      <p>"How did Alaram and Mireya and the rest get across?" asked Sergio.</p>
      <p>
        Instead of answering, Tamoshot picked up a twisted branch from the
        ground and threw it over the chasm. It started to fall but the roaring
        wind snatched it up, twirled it in the air up and across the chasm and
        finally dropped it on the other side where it bounced twice and lay
        still.
      </p>
      <p>"Fly above the chasm high," Sergio shouted.</p>
      <p>"Eh, what's that you say?" Tamoshot asked.</p>
      <p>
        "That's what the raven said," Divino answered him. "But we can't fly."
      </p>
      <p>
        Tamoshot squatted and began to write or draw with his finger in the
        dust. The boys looked but understood nothing of the lines and curves
        being etched by Tamoshot's long finger. Suddenly Sergio understood the
        meaning of the raven's words, and he shivered. "What is it?" Divino
        asked him.
      </p>
      <p>
        "The raven meant we should fly over the chasm carried by the wind. Isn't
        that right, Tamoshot?"
      </p>
      <p>
        But the little man continued to scratch the earth with his head down.
        Sergio turned to his brother. "We don't have to do it. We can turn
        back."
      </p>
      <p>
        Divino frowned and bit his lip. "The raven was right about running
        across the river," he said.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Yes, he was right about that." He felt divino's and Platero's eyes on
        him and knew he would have to decide. He also knew that if he decided to
        give up he would never forgive himself.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I'll go first," he finally said. "If I make it to the other side you
        can follow, If I don't you can go back with Platero and Tamoshot."
      </p>
      <p>
        "But Sergio," Divino said with anguish, "even if we do get to the other
        side, what about Platero?" He seemed more concerned about having to
        leave the donkey behind than about the danger of flying across the
        bottomless chasm without wings.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sergio spoke firmly over the wind: "He will have to stay behind.
        Tamoshot will look after him." The little man had not changed his
        posture. He seemed to be in another world, cut off from the deeds and
        fears of others.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sergio walked to the edge of the chasm. "Remember, Divino," he called
        back, "If I don't make it across go back to Maxanatara."
      </p>
      <p>"He silently prayed a prayer that Dona Ute had taught them:</p>
      <blockquote style="font-style: italic">
        <p>
          Sun and earth, friends forever,<br />
          Wind and sea, leave us never,<br />
          Keep us safe, keep us whole,<br />
          With your help we'll reach our goal.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>And he jumped into the void.</p>
      <p>
        At first he fell down as the branch had, but the wind rising from the
        depths filled his tararobe with air and lifted him high over the chasm
        and twisted him around like a top. He had closed his eyes when he
        started to drop and when he felt himself rising he opened them. The
        earth and sky spun around and made him dizzy so he closed his eyes again
        and became part of the howling wind, rising, falling, rising again,
        spinning over the jutting jaws of the chasm. After what seemed an
        eternity, the wind dropped him with a hard bump on the other side. He
        opened his eyes and saw the cloudless sky above him. When he realized
        that he was lying on his back he jumped to his feet but his head spun
        and he had to sit down.
      </p>
      <p>
        Divino did not wait for his brother to tell him what to do. Before
        Sergio's head had cleared he jumped over the edge of the chasm and was
        soon spinning over it inside his inflated tararobe. He landed in a bush
        on the other side, which made for a softer landing that Sergio's had
        been. He was not too dizzy but his heart beat like a drum.
      </p>
      <p>
        The two boys stood at their edge of the chasm and waved to Platero and
        Tamoshot. Platero held his head high, an uncomfortable position for a
        donkey, and sniffed the wind. Tamoshot was still tracing signs in the
        dust and did not look at them. Platero started to walk away from the
        chasm with his head down and his tail between his legs. After about ten
        yards he stopped and stood still for a few moments. Then he turned and
        faced the chasm again. Donkeys are stubborn animals and seldom change
        their minds, but Platero was an uncommon donkey. He kicked his hind legs
        in the air, brayed as loudly as he could and rushed the chasm at full
        gallop. His legs continued to churn furiously in the air as we went over
        the edge and down, straight down into the depths.
      </p>
      <p>
        The boys cried with one voice: "PLATERO!" The donkey, who wore no
        tararobe of course, only plunged deeper into the chasm until the could
        see him no more. Divino thought his heart would burst and it might have
        if a moment later he had not seen Platero rise up from the darkness,
        high over the chasm in its very center, spin once, twice, three times in
        the air and sail over their heads. The wind set him down gently behind
        them. His legs had never stopped running so when he touched the earth he
        continued to gallop until Sergio called to him to stop. The boys ran
        across the barren ground that separated the chasm from a dense forest
        and Platero turned to meet them. They fell on his neck and kissed and
        hugged him until he shook himself and they fell to the ground on either
        side of him. They laughed until they almost cried. Finally Platero
        butted each of them as if to say: "That's enough of that, let's get
        going again."
      </p>
      <p>"<em>Fare ye well, young friends!</em>"</p>
      <p>
        They turned and saw Tamoshot standing on the other side of the chasm
        smiling and waving.
      </p>
      <p>"Aren't you coming, Mr. Tamoshot?" Divino called.</p>
      <p>
        "Ho, ho, no, no. Too old to learn to fly. Good luck and don't forget the
        raven's words." He turned and walked jauntily away.
      </p>
      <p>
        They shouted goodbye and thanks and when would they see him again, but
        the strange little man never looked back.
      </p>
      <p>
        "We better go into the forest," Sergio said. "or we'll melt in this
        sun."
      </p>
      <p>
        "And I'm hungry," Divino announced. "I hope there's good fruit around
        here."
      </p>
      <p>
        They marched into the forest with renewed confidence after having
        conquered the chasm. If they had known what lay before them their
        confidence would have been considerably less pronounced.
