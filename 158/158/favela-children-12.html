<h3>Chapter 12</h3>


</header>

<main>
<p><strong>Christmas 1972</strong></p>
<p class="intro">Holidays! At least holidays from the Waldorf School. No sooner had I
promoted my class into the fifth grade, put on a play, distributed
report cards, etc, than I rushed off to Londrina. With two huge
suitcases full of presents and used clothes and an unwieldy traveling
bag, I stood before my door waiting to be picked up by a fifty-year-old
bachelor. Like all bachelors he had his ticks, and only wanted to drive
me as far as the city airport and not to the bus-station, which is
farther. Luckily I was able to convince him to go by the Banco
Mercantil, where Zéca works. Zéca had to help me drag the suitcases to
the station. Two minutes before the departure time we arrived panting
and laughing. We checked the baggage as I wanted to travel light. But
the driver told me that, although this bus did go to Londrina,
<em>mine</em> had already left and I should chase it in a taxi. I was
furious as I saw the bus with my luggage, but without me, drive off.</p>

<p>Then I saw that it stopped for a red light and I ran after it, made
imploring gestures to the driver until his heart finally softened and he
opened the door and let me sit in front alongside him. <em>Gracas a
Deus!</em></p>

<p>In Londrina Cido and I rehearsed a Christmas play with some children
from my development aid times. It was a nice celebration. We also showed
slides of the "good old Londrina times". I was doing again what I really
wanted to do: work with the black-brown, curly-haired children.</p>

<p>The accumulated weariness from the school year didn't diminish,
however. Sometimes it is so hot that every movement of the hand requires
a special effort of will. It's also not possible to get a good night's
sleep in the hut because of the mass of children. Their whispering
doesn't stop before eleven o'clock. During the night the cockroaches
rustle about and the rats gnaw at the ceiling. I am still not able to
get used to these disgusting cockroaches. One fell on my head and I had
to look for it in bed with the light from a match. Another time I woke
up and found myself face to face with one of the beasts...</p>

<p>At the end of January a group will come to Sao Paulo in order to
learn a trade with me and to work: Cido, Zéca's brother; Dandoca, Zéca's
cousin; Odair, Zéca's friend from Marumbi. Perhaps also nine-year-old
Maristela, to attend the Waldorf School. A growing family. We'll see how
long I hold out. In any case I'm happy with Zéca. You can see how he is
growing, how the seeds fall on fertile ground and he absorbs the new and
thinks about it, without scorning the old, without ignoring his
roots.</p>
<p><strong>January 1973</strong></p>
<p>A few days ago I was a guest of Dona Irida, a Waldorf teacher who has
a little house on the beach in Suarao, where I let my back get
sunburned. I returned to Sao Paul on the narrow gauge train through the
<em>Serra do Mar</em> around many curves and through twenty tunnels. The
view is marvelous, real jungle with lianas, orchids, parasites that hang
from the trees, and the constant view of the sea. The trip, which should
take four hours, took six. At one station we stopped for an hour to
repair a light. Then, with enthusiastic cries from the passengers, the
train "sped" on. After fifteen minutes it stopped again. "The train is
derailed!" "A robbery!" All kinds of rumors buzzed about, everyone got
out. "Let us pray," someone cried. In fact a freight-car had derailed,
but as the train goes so slowly, nothing happened. The occupants of our
ten cars were transferred to a train with three cars -- a throng of
children, baskets, enormous fishing rods and baggage. With a cry of
triumph we crawled into the metropolis of Sao Paulo.</p>
<p><strong>February 1973</strong></p>
<p>I sit surrounded by four half and full illiterates. They are
astounded that I always find the right key among the forty on the
typewriter.</p>
<p>Our "commune" is doing quite well so far. Besides Zéca, Cido, Odair,
Dandoca, and Maristela, the youngest, now live here with me. We almost
died laughing today. Dandoca has no birth certificate, so we decided to
obtain one so she can get work. We had to go to the civil registry with
two witnesses in order to introduce her to the civilized world. The poor
thing doesn't know anything about herself though, except her first name.
Cido, Zéca and I tried to get some information out of her.</p>
<p>-- What name would you like to have, Dandoca?</p>
<p>-- I don't know?</p>
<p>-- How old would you like to be? (She's about 22.)</p>
<p>-- 20. No, better 18.</p>
<p>-- When's your birthday?</p>
<p>-- No idea.</p>
<p>-- Well, we'll use mine: February 25th.</p>
<p>-- That's all right.</p>
<p>-- What's your father's name?</p>
<p>-- Everyone calls him Ne.</p>
<p>-- Ne! We can't put <em>that</em> on the application. We'll call him
Manuel.</p>
<p>-- And your mother?</p>
<p>-- Josefa.</p>
<p>-- Last name?</p>
<p>-- No idea.</p>
<p>-- We'll call her Josefa da Conceicao.</p>
<p>Then she practiced writing her name. Finally we proudly went to the
civil registry, which was closed by then. Tomorrow.</p>
<p>It is certainly a change to be part of a big family in a big city.
Sao Paulo is confusing enough for us, but for someone who can't read it
must be a nightmare - not able to read bus or street signs, nothing.
What is the red light for? One must explain what a traffic light is, the
meaning of red and green. But I am constantly surprised at how quickly
they adapt to this new life.</p>
<p>And the moral support! When one of them is homesick, the other
despairs of bureaucratic trickery and tells him that he will never get
his documents and therefore will not be able to work. When I finish my
pep-talk and try to encourage them, I also have to say that they should
urinate <em>in</em> the toilet and not alongside it. But these
educational tasks go smoothly and are accompanied by laughter. Playing
with Maristela, teaching her German, teaching the boys arithmetic and
Portuguese, drawing the alphabet with Dandoca; in the meantime preparing
the Krishna legend and Botany for my Waldorf School class -- and the day
is over.</p>
<p><strong>May 1973</strong></p>
<p>School started two weeks ago. I have the fifth grade and Maristela is
in the second. She has adapted well and learns easily with her great
capacity for imitation. At this moment she is singing in English, "Good
morning, good morning, good morning to you, how do you do?" She is
blooming: drawing, handwork, eurythmy -- she soaks them up like a dry
sponge. Arithmetic less! Every evening I read a fairy tale to her. She
asks a lot of questions, often profound ones that don't occur to adults
anymore: Where do we come from? Will the world end some day? Where are
God, the saints and the angels, etc. She likes animal stories best.</p>
<p><strong>May 1973</strong></p>
<p>Everything happens at once. At least a week ago I received a
phone-call from the <em>Policia Feminina</em>. I had a bad fright until
I realized that Hilda was at the bus station waiting for me. Hilda is
the girl I wanted to bring here a year ago because she has suffered from
asthma for twelve years. In the meanwhile it's thirteen years and with
daily attacks. Now she lives here with us and I am trying to find out
from every possible source what kind of treatment might help her. One
says there is a new miracle injection, another that a decoction of
garlic, spices, marjoram, cloves, cinnamon and honey will help. We've
already prepared it. Every morning an egg with honey and iron pills
against anemia; and two to three anti-asthma shots at night. I give the
shots in my sleep (only good deeds can disturb my slumber).</p>
<p>After an attack last Sunday I brought her to the hospital, where they
gave her a ten-inch needle in the vein, after which her eyes rolled and
she spit bile and called <em>Ute de céu</em> - Ute, for the love of God!
It was terrible, especially as a cripple lay in the last throes next to
her and a young man was continually spitting. In the presence of this
human suffering I prepared the history course for school: Buddha's life.
I thought they would keep her in the hospital, but the doctor kept
asking her if she felt better. So we rode back in the bus through
stinking Sao Paulo.</p>
<p><strong>June 1973</strong></p>
<p>We went on a two-day outing with my class to a <em>sitio.</em> A
Sitio is a piece of land with a simple house, some corn or manioca, some
fruit trees. Here there is also a small reservoir, surrounded by a
forest with wild bees, snakes, armadillos and an ant-eater. We picked
the coldest night of the year, just below freezing. When we woke up
everything was white with hoer-frost and white swaths of fog rose from
the pond. Most of us slept in tents, but one girl swung in a hammock
between two trees. I got up twice to see if she had frozen to death, but
she snored away snug in her hammock. In the morning we danced ourselves
warm with a quadrilla. Cido came with us and taught the pupils the
dance. Then we hiked with bush-knives through the forest and over
cleared fields. On the way back it was so warm that the children jumped
into the water.</p>
<p><strong>September 1973</strong></p>
<p>Maristela is doing wonderfully, she has many friends and is an ideal
Waldorf pupil. Weekends other poor children from the neighborhood come
by our house, and she teaches them everything she's learned. At the
moment three of them are in the bathroom. Lessons under the shower!
Afterwards she paints with them, as she has learned to do in the school.
It's funny to walk into one of the stinking holes in which these
children live and see that the only patch of color on the wall is a
Waldorf picture. Maristela also reads them fairy tales and lectures
about the detrimental effects of television!</p>
<p>Cido works as a sweeper in a factory, Odair as window-cleaner in the
Waldorf School. They both go to evening school to make up the fourth
grade. Afterwards Cido will attend the Hotel trade-school, Odair will
probably do the same.</p>
<p><strong>June 1974</strong></p>
<p>Our family has grown by two. Luckily I don't have to bear them all
with labor-pains.</p>
<p>Mario, 23 years old, Ukrainian origin, also from Marumbi, arrived
thin as a reed after a stomach operation. He has gotten a bit fatter now
and goes to the hotel school.</p>
<p>A few weeks later Tereza came, 16 years old. During the Londrina
kindergarten days she never left my side. Her health was very bad and
the doctors didn't know what to do. She was also painfully thin because
she threw up all her food, and her legs were so swollen that in
comparison mine seem dainty. First I brought her to the anthroposophical
clinic, where it was found that there was nothing organically wrong with
her. She was given some medicine and her stomach was better, but her
feet more swollen than ever. So I sent her to a <em>curador</em>
(medicine-man), who spoke to her, prescribed some juices and ordered her
to pray, especially for the girl who had given her the illness through
witchcraft.</p>
<p>Thus the house has gradually filled up. We are now at the respectable
total of nine. Soon there won't be an inch of space left on which
someone isn't lying. Recently a mother from the school gave us three
mattresses and three wool blankets. It was a great moment when we threw
out the old dusty straw sacks and initiated the mattresses.</p>
<p>Some days I don't know where to jump next, being just stone-tired.
The boys all work and go to hotel school in the evening. In order not to
live entirely on sacrifice, I go regularly to an anthroposophical study
group. We read "An Outline of Occult Science" and I hope to have trod
the path of knowledge at least so far in my life that I can develop the
holy patience necessary to patiently "develop higher" the many people
around me. Many habits are so strongly ingrained in them (urinate
<em>alongside</em> the toilet, spit on the floor, sweep everything into
the corner, etc.) that they can only be exorcised through continuous
repetition.</p>
<p>To be continued.</p>
