<p><em>The long-established mechanistic dogma that the heart is a
pressure-propulsion pump that impels the blood, an inert fluid, is
beginning to lose ground in mainstream medicine.</em></p>

<p class="intro">In a recent article<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> published by an acclaimed
peer-reviewed physiology journal, we presented evidence that the
movement of the blood is primary, and the heart “senses” and directs its
distribution to the organs and thus plays only a secondary role. As
pointed out by Rudolf Steiner, the blood can be seen as “materialized”
warmth, a physical expression of the will whose very nature is activity,
i.e., movement. This has been confirmed by observations on embryonic
circulation, where the blood circulates before the functional integrity
of the heart is achieved. Not only does the blood, a liquid organ,<a
href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> move autonomously in response to the
metabolic demands of the tissues, but it also possesses greater vitality
than any other organ. For example, banked blood can be transfused for up
to 6 weeks, as compared to a kidney or the heart, which need to be
implanted into a recipient within 48 and 5 hours, respectively, after
procurement. In as much as the blood in warm-blooded animals is an
expression of the group-soul of a given species, human blood circulating
in the vertical direction is the expression of an individualized human
spirit. We can say that the very nature of blood within an organism is
movement, and if, for any reason, its mobility is limited, it becomes
prone to clotting.</p>
<p>Nature’s water cycle is an apt image of “autonomous” circulation.
Water rises as vapor, condenses into drops, and rains to the ground. The
transition of water between aggregate states, i.e., vapor and liquid is
caused by taking up and releasing of warmth. This is a fundamental
process that plays a key role in the maintenance and renewal of the
earth’s life body, also known as the biosphere. Similarly, the sum of
human body water (blood, lymph, interstitial, and intracellular fluid)
is subject to incessant movements effected by metabolic warmth.
Collectively, the total amount of water in the human body, estimated to
be about 75% of the body weight, is the carrier of the formative forces
also known as the <em>“</em>life body” or “etheric body.”<a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>
Blood, consisting of protein-rich plasma and red blood cells (RBCs), is
a further transformation of the etheric body and the bearer of the human
self or the “I”.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> With 4-6 millions of RBCs per cubic
millimeter, the RBCs outnumber all other types of cells in the body!
RBCs are filled with hemoglobin, an iron containing pigment which binds
oxygen in the lung and delivers it by way of the arterial blood to the
tissues for the support of cellular respiration. The venous blood, on
the other hand, transports carbon dioxide, a toxic byproduct of tissue
metabolism, to be exhaled by the lung. Not unlike water in outer nature,
the blood alternates between the life-filled, oxygen-laden “light”
condition striving towards the periphery, and the carbon dioxide-laden
“heavy” state seeking the center.</p>
<p>Conventional physiology, lacking the concept of a life or etheric
body, ascribes the circulation of the blood solely to the pumping action
of the heart. The movement of tissue fluids, by contrast, is attributed
to changes in temperature and concentration of solutes. However, no
cogent explanation exists for the circulation of bile and the movement
of lymph, cerebrospinal fluid, and numerous other substances. The origin
of this blind spot in physiology is rooted in physics and can be traced
to Galileo, Newton, Descartes, and their followers, who, with the advent
of an intellectual</p>
<p>conception of the world, lost the feeling for the cosmic dimensions
of earthly phenomena. They reduced the four-element Aristotelian
physics,<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> of which the ethers were still an
integral part, to three states of matter – solid, liquid, and gas.
Warmth, the fourth state that permeates and transforms them all and
forms the bridge between the physical and the etheric, was simply
ascribed to hypothetical atomic motion. Atomistic thinking, the bedrock
of the materialistic world conception, originated with Greek
philosophers, most notably Democritus and Epicurus. It resurfaced with
the advent of the consciousness soul age in the 15th century and
continues to this day. (Of note, in an effort to expose this trend in
science, Rudolf Steiner wrote his first scientific essay<a href="#fn6"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> on
the refutation of atomism, at the age of 21!) The inevitable result of
this reductionist approach to nature was that only what can be “measured
and weighed,” i.e., the “centric” forces, such as gravity, pressure,
electricity, magnetism, etc., were accepted by physics and physiology,
whereas the activities, that is, their etheric counterparts, remained
unrecognized.</p>
<p>All kingdoms of nature, including humans, are subject to centric
forces as well as to forces of the periphery, namely, to warmth, light,
chemical or tone, and life ethers. The ethers reach us through the skin,
the senses, and our breath. In the process, they activate our own
individualized life or etheric forces. Spiritual scientific research
shows that the sum of etheric forces in our organism manifests as
negative pressure or suction.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> The existence of
negative pressure in the chest (which prevents the collapse of the
lungs), at the center of blood vortices in the heart, and in tissue
spaces throughout the body is well-recognized in physiology. However,
the fact that collectively this constitutes a “force-field” is not
acknowledged. The existence of this field has now been proposed as the
actual cause of blood’s movement from the periphery to the heart. Its
primary field of action is the smallest vessels, the capillaries. Thus,
as in any circular motion, two opposing sets of forces are connected
with blood’s movement, namely, the centrifugal and centripetal. The
former is active in the arterial pressure maintained by the left
ventricle, and the latter manifests as suction.</p>
<h4>Physiology of Freedom</h4>
<p>The assertion that the blood circulates is not quite accurate.
Rather, the blood moves in lemniscates and, as such, is a reflection of
the planetary movements as described by Steiner in the Astronomy
Course.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> The heart is placed at the crossing
point between the greater (systemic) and the lesser (lung) circulations
and, like the sun, can be seen as a dynamic pivot point ceaselessly
balancing the two. In that sense, the heart and the vital organs above
and below the heart represent the inner solar system.<a href="#fn9"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>The statement that “the heart is not a pump” is similarly incorrect
because a hydraulic ram, by which the physical principle of the heart’s
action can be demonstrated, is a type of pump driven by the momentum of
flowing water. The heart is therefore “activated” by the blood, and its
rhythmic movement is the expression of the macrocosmic soul/spirit
forces that reach it by way of the senses and of the “earthly” forces
streaming to it from the movement-metabolic system.</p>
<p>It is known that the heart expends only about 15-20% of its energetic
demands on contraction and expansion, with the balance (some 80%!)
converted into warmth. To date, no rational explanation has been
advanced as to why the heart should generate so much heat. It has even
been suggested that the heart simply is an “inefficient pump.” For
comparison, the efficiency<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> of an internal
combustion engine is about 30-35%, significantly higher than that of the
heart. The answer to this physiological riddle can only be given by
occult physiology, namely, that the warmth of the heart serves as a
<em>bridge</em><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> between the soul-spiritual and the
etheric-physical constitution of the human being. It is the gateway by
which sense impressions from the outer and inner world, memories,
judgments, and karmic impulses are joined with our I, made “our
own.”</p>
<p>At long last, the heart has been freed of a task it does not perform,
burdened upon it by mechanistic thinking, and which, at any rate, is
physically impossible. How could an organ the size of a fist push blood,
a relatively viscous fluid (2-3 times greater than water), through an
estimated 50,000 km of blood vessels, mostly consisting of capillaries
(1011), many with diameters that are smaller than the red blood cells!
It may still take some time before physiologists discover that, in
addition to the numerous functions the heart is known to perform, it is
the organ of the soul and the agent of destiny. But, at the very least,
the door has been opened towards a future, more human physiology.</p>
