<P><IMG SRC="../webzine156/webzine157/salamander-1.jpg" NAME="Image2" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=235 HEIGHT=214 BORDER=0>
</P>
<P CLASS="intro">A salamander, besides being an interesting
amphibious creature, in Spanish &ndash; at least in Argentine Spanish
&ndash; is a squat, cast-iron, wood-burning stove used for heating,
called a <EM>salamandra</EM>. Not much more to say about this
primitive stove&hellip;now, so let&rsquo;s start with the creature.
What I learned about salamanders was that it is an amphibian of the
order urodela which was often in olden times credited with fantastic
and sometimes occult qualities such as an affinity with elemental
fire, as in the allegorical descriptions of animals in medieval
bestiaries.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>***</P>
<P>Now back to the stove. When we moved to the western sierras of
Argentina, far from the confines of Buenos Aires, I converted a
<EM>galp&oacute;n,</EM> a kind of large shed mostly used for tools
and storage, into an office about 50 meters from the main house.
&ldquo;Converted&rdquo; is perhaps an exaggeration, for all I really
did was paint it, disinfect it, install ceiling insulation and an air
conditioning unit. A salamander was already there, not pretty
perhaps, but so what, I was there to work and be reasonably warm in
winter and reasonably cool in summer. By the way, in case you&rsquo;re
confused already, Argentina is not Mexico and it does get cold in
winter; not what you who live in the northern hemisphere call cold,
but one does need heating in winter. Air conditioning is not
necessary here at 1,000 meters altitude, but in my <EM>galp&oacute;n</EM>
with its tin roof and ill-fitting windows inviting in the heat, it
certainly is.</P>
<P>So when our first winter came I threw some newspaper and kindling
wood into the salamander/salamandera and waited for it to live up to
its reputation. It didn&rsquo;t, kept going out, leaked smoke and
left ashes that had to be cleaned out. In short, my opinion was that
it <EM>no sirve para nada.</EM> Primitive stuff like this may enchant
the natives, but this is the modern world. So I had a gas heater
installed &ndash; despite gas being frightfully expensive &ndash; and
an electric one &ndash; despite electricity being frightfully
expensive.</P>
<P>And so the years flew by, not as comfortable as I would have liked
to have been, but tolerably so.</P>
<P>One day a week ago, an friend who worked in construction, Nino,
here to advise on enhanced heating for the main house, where we
already have a fireplace, a gas heater and an electric one. There are
new salmandras on the market now, much more efficient than the old
ones (according to the publicity) and considerably more attractive<EM>.</EM>
I asked him about the advisability of installing one in our large
living-dining room. He advised against it for various reasons,
including the price , about $1,500, then said that the old ones are
much better, but both are a lot of work cleaning out every day. I
said: but I have an old one in my galp&oacute;n-office <EM>que</EM>
<EM>no sirve para nada.</EM> What? he said, let&rsquo;s have a look.
So we walked over to the galp&oacute;n where he gazed at the
salamandra like an old friend. What&rsquo;s the problem? Lots of
smoke? Goes out all the time?</P>
<P>S&iacute;.</P>
<P>Nino went outside and looked up at the iron pipe leading from the
salamander up through the roof where a metal cap rested on its head.
When&rsquo;s the last time you cleaned that pipe? he asked me. Uhh&hellip;
<EM>nunca,</EM> I replied<EM>.</EM> He laughed<EM>:</EM> Gotta clean
it, hombre. That pipe probably has all kinds of junk in it not
letting it breathe: smoke out, air in.</P>
<P>At that moment I remembered the dream I&rsquo;d had the night
before. You know, how sometimes you wake up and don&rsquo;t remember
a dream you had until later.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>***</P>
<P>The dream: I wake up sweating, wondering why it&rsquo;s so hot in
winter. Then I see a bright red light at the foot of the bed. When
I&rsquo;m able to focus (no specs needed), here&rsquo;s what I see:</P>
<P><IMG SRC="../webzine156/webzine157/salamander-2.jpg" NAME="Image3" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=213 HEIGHT=317 BORDER=0>
</P>
<P>Who..what&hellip;are you? I stammer.</P>
<P>Who&hellip;what&hellip;do I look like?</P>
<P>Fire. (Strangely enough, I felt no fear yet, only surprise.)</P>
<P>I&hellip;am&hellip; Sof&iacute;a Salamandra!</P>
<P>Oh yeah?</P>
<P>Yeah, and if you don&rsquo;t know who&hellip;or what&hellip;I am,
I suggest you listen carefully. He, I mean she (&ldquo;salamandra&rdquo;
is feminine in Spanish) puts on a glove &ndash; fire proof, I
suppose, snaps her fingers and a charred-at-the-edges paper appears.
She reads:</P>
<P><EM>Salamanders may actively defend themselves once they are
grasped by a predator. Besides various antipredator postures,
salamandra adults are able to exude toxic skin secretions such as the
neurotoxic alkaloid Samandarin. This alkaloid causes strong muscle
and hypertension combined with hyperventilation in all vertebrates.
The poison glands of the fire salamander are concentrated in certain
areas of the body, especially around the head and the dorsal skin
surface. The colored portions of the animal&rsquo;s skin usually
coincide with these glands. Compounds in the skin secretions may be
effective against bacterial and fungal infections of the epidermis;
some are potentially dangerous to human life.</EM> That&rsquo;s from
Wikipedia.</P>
<P>That, understandably, makes me nervous. I say, Do you mind if I
open a window? It&rsquo;s so hot in here.</P>
<P>Of course I mind, she crackles, it&rsquo;s freezing here. Now just
shut up.</P>
<P>Okay, but I&rsquo;m not a predator for God&rsquo;s sake.</P>
<P>And do not take the name of the Lord in vain.</P>
<P>Sorry.</P>
<P>She seems to grow, almost touching the bed. Hey, be careful,
you&rsquo;ll set the whole house on fire.</P>
<P>Too bad &ndash; but she diminishes a bit.</P>
<P>You have been treating me badly, don Frank (the honorific &ldquo;don&rdquo;
being sarcastic). To me that is predation.</P>
<P>But how? I ask, I never saw you before.</P>
<P>Oh yes you did. Years ago you invoked me in your pot-bellied
homonymous stove without sufficient air and with wet wood. You struck
a match, <EM>one of my fingers</EM>, to a piece of newspaper and
threw it in, and when someone does that I <EM>must</EM> react as best
I can. I suffered greatly, choked, gasped for air on my own sweat,
what you call smoke, until I finally died.</P>
<P>But..but, I say in my defense, you&rsquo;re not dead, you&rsquo;re
here. And you go out all the time.</P>
<P>Of course I&rsquo;m here, you fool! When I go out after having
consumed healthy dry wood and am not asphyxiated by fools I go to
sleep until I am invoked anew. Otherwise I die out, and <EM>you</EM>
are the guilty predator.</P>
<P>But if you <EM>died</EM> out, I insist, only getting myself in
deeper, how come you&rsquo;re here?</P>
<P>I must reincarnate then, which is a lengthy and unpleasant
process, especially when it&rsquo;s for the benefit of idiots like
you.</P>
<P>Oh, I say with as much humility as I can muster under the
circumstances, I&rsquo;m so sorry. I didn&rsquo;t know.</P>
<P>Ignorance is no excuse under the laws of nature.</P>
<P>I open my mouth, but close it again. What can I say to that? After
all, I&rsquo;m no expert on the laws of nature.</P>
<P>Suddenly &ndash; Oh, the horror! &ndash; Sof&iacute;a Salamandra
transforms herself into her real, or other, self</P>
<P>and starts to crawl towards me. Stop! I cry. What can I do to make
it up to you?</P>
<P>The amphibian stops its forward motion and transforms back to its
fire-form.</P>
<P>Are you truly penitent? she asks.</P>
<P>Yes, yes, what can I do.</P>
<P><A NAME="fnref1"></A>First of all, she says &ndash; mixing some
blue into her color &ndash;, clean out the exhaust pipe from above
and the stove from below, then use dry kindling and have some
respect. Do you know why I&rsquo;m giving you a second chance? I
shook my head. Once you wrote a wonderful children&rsquo;s story in
which my brother rusty was treated with respect <A HREF="#fn1"><SUP>1</SUP></A>.
There will be no third chance. I&rsquo;ll be waiting in the
nature-world.</P>
<P>And poof, she was gone.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>***</P>
<P>Did you hear me, Frank, Nino said, you gotta clean it out. We came
back into the galp&oacute;n where Nino re-inspected the salamandra.
(We&rsquo;ll call it that from now on.) And you need a piece of mica
to put here. He pointed at an oval-shaped window in its little door.</P>
<P>The next morning I called the lightest odd-jobs guy I knew to go
up on the tin roof and attack the pipe-cleaning job. I worried that a
heavier one might fall through the roof.</P>
<P>Sure, no problem, Mariano said. When&rsquo;s the last time you
cleaned it? When I told him <EM>nunca</EM> he said: <EM>Mierda</EM>,
that&rsquo;s probably before I was born.</P>
<P>He climbed up a ladder onto the roof and tip-toed to the head of
the pipe with a broom-stick in his hand. I couldn&rsquo;t bear to
look, so I went to the house to watch the Mets game on Directv,
hoping they&rsquo;d end their losing streak. I figured it&rsquo;d
take a while to clean out that pipe anyway.</P>
<P>A half-hour later I heard Mariano calling me. I went back to the
office-galp&oacute;n. He opened the door of the salamandra, which was
now full of empty wasp nests. That&rsquo;s what was clogging the
pipe, he said. They leave in the winter, but they&rsquo;ll be back.&nbsp;
They think this is a comfy home. You&rsquo;ll need mica for the
window.</P>
<P>Do you know where I can get some? I asked him.</P>
<P>Hmmm, maybe Ort&iacute;z in Villa Dolores. He&rsquo;s the only one
who&rsquo;d have weird stuff like that.</P>
<P>Mica: &ldquo;The <STRONG>mica</STRONG> group of sheet silicate
(phyllosilicate) minerals, includes several closely related materials
having nearly perfect basal cleavage&hellip;&rdquo; I found in
Wikipedia.</P>
<P>I went to Ort&iacute;z in Villa Dolores, about 20 kms away, the
largest town in the area. He scratched his head.&nbsp; Nah, don&rsquo;t
make&rsquo;m anymore. I asked him where I might find it and he said,
Maybe Gonzalez&hellip;maybe.&nbsp; So I drove across town to
Gonzalez, who didn&rsquo;t have it either. He said I could try a
place called La Pampina on the road between Villa Dolores and San
Javier. It&rsquo;s kinda hard to find, he added, just after that
so-called motel, <EM>Eros.</EM> Ever been there? he smirked.</P>
<P>By then I was feeling frustrated, but I was anxious not to receive
any more nightly visits from Sof&iacute;a Salamandra, so I drove to
<EM>Eros,</EM> the only per-hour motel in the area. <EM>Buenas
tardes, se&ntilde;or</EM>, the corpulent madam said. All alone and
early I see. No matter, we can arrange early company for you. 24 hour
service provided and being lonely is not healthy.</P>
<P>Actually, I only need information at the moment (thus letting her
think there might be business in the future). I&rsquo;m looking for
La Pampina.</P>
<P>La Pampina? Ah yes, go north about a league and turn right on a
dirt road and you&rsquo;ll come to it sooner or later, can&rsquo;t
miss it, it&rsquo;s the only thing on that road, never been there
myself. Ask for don Robindo, he&rsquo;s a good client of mine. Tell
him la Mariposa sent you.</P>
<P>I found the dirt road, turned right and drove about three kms till
I came to a complex of large sheds and a small one with a crooked
sign reading <EM>oficina</EM> nailed to it. It was empty. I walked
around until I saw three men in coveralls standing before the largest
shed smoking and talking with gestures. I got out of my car,
approached and addressed the oldest one, a guy about sixty with a
potbelly and pens in his shirt pocket. He looked like the boss. I
didn&rsquo;t consider an introduction from a whorehouse madam to be a
diplomatic opening, so, after politely greeting him, I said I was
looking for mica. For what purpose, se&ntilde;or, he asked. For a
salamandra. He looked surprised. Only one? he said. When I nodded
they all laughed. I didn&rsquo;t see the joke, but I grinned
sheepishly.</P>
<P>You see, don Robindo said (his named was stitched on his shirt
pocket), we make industrial mica here. Come, I&rsquo;ll show you.</P>
<P>I followed him into the shed which was as large as a warehouse and
was filled with piles of what I learned was mica in various stages of
the production process. He went into a detailed description of their
work, which I won&rsquo;t go into here, although it was interesting.</P>
<P>Maybe we can find what you need here, he said, pointing to a pile
of small mica pieces. He rummaged through the pile and came up with
several oddly-shaped pieces. These aren&rsquo;t thin enough to see
through, he said, but I assume you only want to keep the smoke out &ndash;
or in.&nbsp; He gave me the pieces, without charge, and having
noticed my accent, asked: Where are you from, se&ntilde;or? Where
would you guess, don Robindo? Which is my usual reply to that
question; it&rsquo;s an ice-breaker, although I didn&rsquo;t really
need one then.</P>
<P><EM>Alemania</EM>, he said, giving the most common reply.&nbsp; I
told him to guess again and he went through most of the countries of
the world before finally hitting on <EM>Los Estados Unidos</EM>.
(There aren&rsquo;t many of us in Argentina.)</P>
<P><EM>Bueno, muy bueno</EM>, he said and clapped me on the shoulder.</P>
<P>I thanked him profusely and drove home, where I somehow fitted the
largest mica piece inside the salamandra&rsquo;s window, put in dry
wood and some pine-cones as a homecoming gift for Sof&iacute;a
Salamandra and lighted it with one of her fingers.</P>
<P>It worked perfectly. As the waves of heat surrounded me it felt
like a warm embrace from Sof&iacute;a Salamandra, who, however, I was
confident of never meeting again &ldquo;in the flesh&rdquo;, so to
speak.</P>
