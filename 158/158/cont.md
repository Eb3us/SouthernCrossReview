"Before embarking on a series of pictures
inspired by Polynesian religious beliefs, Gauguin devoted this, his
first major Tahitian canvas, to a Christian theme, describing it in a
letter of March 1892: \"An angel with yellow wings reveals Mary and
Jesus, both Tahitians, to two Tahitian women, nudes dressed in pareus, a
sort of cotton cloth printed with flowers that can be draped from the
waist. Very somber, mountainous background and flowering trees . . . a
dark violet path and an emerald green foreground, with bananas on the
left. I'm rather happy with it.\"",
