<p><strong>Diary 1965 - 1967</strong></p>
<p>Antwerp, August 20, 1965</p>
<p>Rudely awakened at five in the morning by the noise of the ship being
unloaded, jumped out of bed, put on jeans and a sweater and went out on
deck. I watched the unloading of meat from Argentina and then took a
stroll through the harbor area where I discovered a wonderful Flemish
Gothic church.</p>
<p>Le Havre, August 25</p>
<p>We've started to save money and now use the menus as post-cards. It
feels as though we're on vacation and it takes a great mental effort to
realize that in three weeks we'll be working in the favelas. But now
we're being drowsily rocked on deck by long, softly rolling waves.</p>
<p>At sea between Le Havre and Vigo (Spain), August 26</p>
<p>A storm today! Waves all around, unbridled, spraying water on deck
and a wavelet in our cabin. Quite fitting for Biscaya. Wrapped in
leather coats, our bodies at a 45-degree angle, we went for a "stroll"
on the deck of the Laennec.</p>
<p>Lisbon, August 27</p>
<p>We sweat in a Portuguese café‚ tired from the heat, which is
gradually taking on Brazilian characteristics, and try out our newly
acquired Portuguese phrases for the first time. Portugal is a true
developing country – wonderful flowering gardens and villas, liberally
laid out streets, beautiful Gothic churches from Portugal's heyday. And,
alongside them, beggars scavenging, abandoned children. It seems not
quite European. But it probably depends on your perspective. Coming from
Brazil, the fact that one gets a feeling of history and tradition
because of the churches and monuments makes it part of Europe.</p>
<p>Today we leave Europe!</p>
<p>Rio de Janeiro, September 7, 1965</p>
<p>After the ten-day Atlantic crossing we are feverish to have land
under our feet again. Rio, the <em>cidade maravilhosa</em> (wonderful
city), is in sight under a blue veil of haze. Miles of white beach
devoid of life. Seemingly hostile forests cover the mountains in the
background. It's difficult to imagine the nearby metropolis. Entry into
the harbor is really beautiful: the Sugarloaf, the many inlets and
islands, behind them the skyscrapers of Copacabana and, like a frame,
the thick rain forest with its unknown trees surging exuberantly up the
mountains from the sea. The first impression is of an American city lost
in the tropics. The "white" face of Brazil is the first to be seen. The
black one presents itself immediately afterwards. however, in the form
of the many black workers who unload our ship.</p>
<p><em>Estamos chegando …o Rio</em>. (We are arriving in Rio.) The
phrase from our language book has become reality.</p>
<p>Santos, September 11</p>
<p>We left the Laennec for good and have been hanging around Santos for
two days, ill-humored and numb, with our crates and suitcases. Yesterday
the customs officials ransacked my lovingly packed bags and temporarily
confiscated my tape recorder. Finally Nivea cream and Otto's opera
records served as bribes. Tomorrow we continue by bus, a twelve-hour
drive to the interior, to Londrina.</p>
<p>Londrina, mid-September, 1965</p>
<p>Our reception here was touching: the house was decorated with little
flags, a rocket was launched as we descended from the jeep; three
children, fit representatives of racial mixture, one blond, the other
brown and a third black, gave us flowers. Fray Nereu, a Franciscan monk
who has taken on the favela's sanitation problems, gave an impassioned
speech full of genuine Latin pathos. All this under the eyes of
television and the Londrina newspaper, in which we are to be admired on
the front page of today's edition.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday the bishop of Londrina was here in all his
finery, including lilac stockings, and last night the criminal police
inspector came to visit and offer us his services - you can never know!
He learned from the newspaper that we were living in Londrina's worst
quarter. Right behind our favela is one of Brazil's most infamous
red-light districts. Whereas in the favela the women only show their
breasts when nursing infants, the women in that district do so while the
men pass through on their way to work, even when in the company of the
priest. As the police inspector make a very unpleasant impression - he
is of German descent and looks like a Nazi storm trooper - we believed
only half of what he told us about the many gangsters, muggings and
robberies here. As far as we can tell so far, the favelas are not
meeting places for criminal elements. The <em>favelados</em> are simply
poor due to lack of employment and schooling; and they are possessed by
an irrepressible wanderlust that pushes them on to another city with all
they own as soon as they have earned enough money.</p>
<p>I must tell the story of the rats. Our house previously belonged to a
Japanese <em>fazendeiro</em> (farmland owner) who disappeared when his
debts became too big. The house stood empty for many years and the
cellar became the undisturbed meeting place for Londrina's animal world.
During the second night, awakened by a scratching sound, I carefully
switched on the light and saw a fat rat scramble away from a carrot a
foot from my head. I ran to our men who, armed with a broom and club,
drove the wildly scurrying creature away. I was far from calm however,
as the beast had bored a hole through the floor from the cellar and was
surely only the advance guard of an army. The animal life in our house
is active indeed: flying, clothes-eating cockroaches, hordes of
mosquitoes, mice, a hairy poisonous spider, fleas and beetles.</p>
<p>The favela is depressingly poor, but even such poverty is relative;
the favelas in Rio or the slums in India are worse. Even the poorest
seem to have someone poorer than themselves. Horrible holes serve as
dwellings for countless children and their parents. A family of five
lives in a discarded bus together with chickens, a dog, a sewing machine
and an open cooking fire. The father gets up every morning a 4 a.m. to
collect scrap paper from the street and sell it. They came, as did most
of the favela residents, from Brazil's impoverished northeast. The
favela residents aren't anti-social, but simply poor people who, because
of their low income, cannot afford decent housing and therefore nail
together huts made of boards on the edge of the city. The wives'
additional income doesn't suffice for a better life. Many women and
children work at picking coffee beans. They earn about a dollar for a
thirty-pound sack of beans. I only realized how tiring and time
consuming this work is when I tried it myself.</p>
<p>The men mostly work as unskilled laborers in factories where they
receive the legal minimum wage of fifty dollars a month, or as
coffee-bag carriers in the warehouses. (The faster you can run with a
sack the more you earn.) Or they sell fruit, sweets and roasted peanuts
on the street.</p>
<p>The racial mixture is unimaginable, although in the favela the
majority is black. One sees Negroid kinky hair in blond editions, or
Blacks with slanted Mongoloid eyes, or Aryan blue eyes. Besides these
hybrids, there are also the more or less "racially pure" Spanish,
Hungarian, Italian, Russian and German favelados - the jetsam of various
immigration waves. And they really get along with each other. What they
told us in Germany is true: how friendly, obliging and, despite their
misery, how happy Brazilians are! During our rounds through the favela
we are always received with a smile, a cafezinho is offered (and drunk,
despite the axioms learned about "tropical hygiene"). When you take a
child, usually covered with terra roxa (red earth) and full of
sores,into your arms, contact is quickly established. We have yet to see
a mistrusting or closed face.</p>
<p>Londrina has about 120,000 inhabitants. The city stands (or falls)
with coffee. Thirty-five years ago, we are repeatedly told with pride,
it was all jungle here, which is hard to imagine when you look down at
miles of coffee trees from one of the city's skyscrapers. The jungle was
so mercilessly cleared away that the climate has changed in the last
decades -- there is no longer a regularly occurring rainfall and the
earth threatens to erode. The mato (jungle) seems inexhaustible, but all
that remains of it are little jungle-islands. It seems that every
country must live out its own experience with soil exploitation -- just
as today's youth refuses to learn from the mistakes of the older
generation. Eucalyptus trees are planted for reforestation. They grow
quickly, but exhaust the earth's alkaline content even more.</p>
