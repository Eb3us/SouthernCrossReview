<h1>McSorley's Old Ale House</h1>

<main>

<h4>April 14, 1940</h4>
<p class="intro">McSorley’s occupies the ground floor of a red brick tenement at 15
Seventh Street, just off Cooper Square, where the Bowery ends. It was
opened in 1854 and is the oldest saloon in the city. In eighty-six years
it has had four owners—an Irish immigrant, his son, a retired policeman,
and his daughter—and all of them have been opposed to change. It is
equipped with electricity, but the bar is stubbornly illuminated with a
pair of gas lamps, which flicker fitfully and throw shadows on the low,
cobwebby ceiling each time someone opens the street door. There is no
cash register. Coins are dropped in soup bowls—one for nickels, one for
dimes, one for quarters, and one for halves—and bills are kept in a
rosewood cashbox. It is a drowsy place; the bartenders never make a
needless move, the customers nurse their mugs of ale, and the three
clocks on the walls have not been in agreement for many years. The
clientele is motley. It includes mechanics from the many garages in the
neighborhood, salesmen from the restaurant-supply houses on Cooper
Square, truck-drivers from Wanamakers’s, internes from Bellevue,
students from Cooper Union, clerks from the row of secondhand bookshops
north of Astor Place, and men with tiny pensions who live in hotels on
the Bowery but are above drinking in the bars on that street. The
backbone of the clientele, however, is a rapidly thinning group of
crusty old men, predominantly Irish, who have been drinking there since
they were youths and now have a proprietary feeling toward the place.
Some of these veterans clearly remember John McSorley, the founder, who
died in 1910 at the age of eighty-seven. They refer to him as Old John,
and they like to sit in rickety armchairs around the big belly stove
which heats the place, gnaw on the stems of their pipes, and talk about
him.</p>
<p>Old John was quirky. He was normally affable but was subject to
spells of unaccountable surliness during which he would refuse to answer
when spoken to. He went bald in early manhood and began wearing
scraggly, patriarchal sideburns before he was forty. Many photographs of
him are in existence, and it is obvious that he had a lot of unassumed
dignity. He patterned his saloon after a public house he had known in
Ireland and originally called it the Old House at Home; around 1908 the
signboard blew down, and when he ordered a new one he changed the name
to McSorley’s Old Ale House. That is still the official name; customers
never have called it anything but McSorley’s. Old John believed it
impossible for men to drink with tranquillity in the presence of women;
there is a fine back room in the saloon, but for many years a sign was
nailed on the street door, saying, “Notice. No Back Room in Here for
Ladies.” In McSorley’s entire history, in fact, the only woman customer
ever willingly admitted was an addled old peddler called Mother
Fresh-Roasted, who claimed her husband died from the bite of a lizard in
Cuba during the Spanish-American War and who went from saloon to saloon
on the lower East Side for a couple of generations hawking peanuts,
which she carried in her apron. On warm days, Old John would sell her an
ale, and her esteem for him was such that she embroidered him a little
American flag and gave it to him one Fourth of July; he had it framed
and placed it on the wall above his brassbound ale pump, and it is still
there. When other women came in, Old John would hurry forward, make a
bow, and say, “Madam, I’m sorry, but we don’t serve ladies.” This
technique is still used.</p>
<p>In his time, Old John catered to the Irish and German
workingmen—carpenters, tanners, bricklayers, slaughter-house butchers,
teamsters, and brewers—who populated the Seventh Street neighborhood,
selling ale in pewter mugs at five cents a mug and putting out a free
lunch inflexibly consisting of soda crackers, raw onions, and cheese;
present-day customers are wont to complain that some of the cheese Old
John laid out on opening night in 1854 is still there. Adjacent to the
free lunch he kept a quart crock of tobacco and a rack of clay and
corncob pipes—the purchase of an ale entitled a man to a smoke on the
house; the rack still holds a few of the communal pipes. Old John was
thrifty and was able to buy the tenement—it is five stories high and
holds eight families —about ten years after he opened the saloon in it.
He distrusted banks and always kept his money in a cast-iron safe; it
still stands in the back room, but its doors are loose on their hinges
and there is nothing in it but an accumulation of expired saloon
licences and several McSorley heirlooms, including Old John’s straight
razor. He lived with his family in a flat directly over the saloon and
got up every morning at five; he walked to the Battery and back before
breakfast, no matter what the weather. He unlocked the saloon at seven,
swept it out himself, and spread sawdust on the floor. Until he became
too feeble to manage a racing sulky, he always kept a horse and a nanny
goat in a stable around the corner on St. Mark’s Place. He kept both
animals in the same stall, believing, like many horse-lovers, that
horses should have company at night. During the lull in the afternoon a
stable-hand would lead the horse around to a hitching block in front of
the saloon, and Old John, wearing his bar apron, would stand on the curb
and groom the animal. A customer who wanted service would tap on the
window and Old John would drop his currycomb, step inside, draw an ale,
and return at once to the horse. On Sundays he entered sulky races on
uptown highways.</p>
<p>From the time he was twenty until he was fifty-five, Old John drank
steadily, but throughout the last thirty-two years of his life he did
not take a drop, saying, “I’ve had my share.” Except for a few
experimental months in 1905 or 1906, no spirits ever have been sold in
McSorley’s; Old John maintained that the man never lived who needed a
stronger drink than a mug of stock ale warmed on the hob of a stove. He
was a big eater. Customarily, just before locking up for the night, he
would grill himself a three-pound T-bone, placing it on a coal shovel
and holding it over a bed of oak coals in the back-room fireplace. He
liked to fit a whole onion into the hollowed-out heel of a loaf of
French bread and eat it as if it were an apple. He had an extraordinary
appetite for onions, the stronger the better, and said that “Good ale,
raw onions, and no ladies” was the motto of his saloon. About once a
month during the winter he presided over an on-the-house beefsteak party
in the back room, and late in life he was president of an organization
of gluttons called the Honorable John McSorley Pickle, Baseball Nine,
and Chowder Club, which held hot-rock clambakes in a picnic grove on
North Brother Island in the East River. On the walls are a number of
photographs taken at outings of the club, and in most of them the
members are squatting around hogsheads of ale; except for the president,
they all have drunken, slack-mouthed grins and their eyes look dazed.
Old John had a bull-frog bass and enjoyed harmonizing; with a choir of
drunks. His favorite songs were “Muldoon, the Solid Man,” “Swim Out,
You’re Over Your Head,” “Maggie Murphy’s Home,” and “Since the Soup
House Moved Away.” These songs were by Harrigan and Hart, who were then
called “the Gilbert and Sullivan of the U.S.A.” He had great respect for
them and was pleased exceedingly when, in 1882, they made his saloon the
scene of one of their slum comedies; it was called “McSorley’s
Inflation.”</p>
<p>Although by no means a handshaker, Old John knew many prominent men.
One of his closest friends was Peter Cooper, president of the North
American Telegraph Company and founder of Cooper Union, which is a
half-block west of the saloon. Mr. Cooper, in his declining years, spent
so many afternoons in the back room philosophizing with the workingmen
that he was given a chair of his own; it was equipped with an inflated
rubber cushion. (The chair is still there; each April 4th for a number
of years after Mr. Cooper’s death, on April 4, 1883, it was draped with
black cloth.) Also, like other steadfast customers, Mr. Cooper had a
pewter mug on which his name had been engraved with an icepick. He gave
the saloon a life-sized portrait of himself, which hangs over the mantel
in the back room. It is a rather appropriate decoration, because, since
the beginning of prohibition, McSorley’s has been the official saloon of
Cooper Union students. Sometimes a sentimental student will stand
beneath the portrait and drink a toast to Mr. Cooper.</p>
<p>Old John had a remarkable passion for memorabilia. For years he saved
the wishbones of Thanksgiving and Christmas turkeys and strung them on a
rod connecting the pair of gas lamps over the bar; the dusty bones are
invariably the first thing a new customer gets inquisitive about. Not
long ago, a Johnny-come-lately infuriated one of the bartenders by
remarking, “Maybe the old boy believed in voodoo.” Old John decorated
the partition between barroom and back room with banquet menus,
autographs, starfish shells, theatre programs, political posters, and
worn-down shoes taken off the hoofs of various race and brewery horses.
Above the entrance to the back room he hung; a shillelagh and a sign:
“<strong>be good or begone.</strong>” On one wall of the barroom he
placed portraits of horses, steamboats, Tammany bosses, jockeys, actors,
singers, and assassinated statesmen; there are many excellent portraits
of Lincoln, Garfield, and McKinley. On the same wall he hung framed
front pages of old newspapers; one, from the
London <strong>Times</strong> for June 22, 1815, contains a paragraph on
the beginning of the battle of Waterloo, in the lower right-hand corner,
and another, from the New York <strong>Herald</strong> of April 15,
1865, has a single-column story on the shooting of Lincoln. He blanketed
another wall with lithographs and steel engravings. One depicts
Garfield’s deathbed. Another is entitled “The Great Fight.” It was
between Tom Hyer and Yankee Sullivan, both bare-knuckled, at Still Pond
Heights, Maryland, in 1849. It was won by Hyer in sixteen rounds, and
the prize was $10,000. The judges wore top hats. The brass title tag on
another engraving reads, “Rescue of Colonel Thomas J. Kelly and Captain
Timothy Deacy by Members of the Irish Revolutionary Brotherhood from the
English Government at Manchester, England, September 18, 1867.” A copy
of the Emancipation Proclamation is on this wall; so, almost inevitably,
is a facsimile of Lincoln’s saloon licence. An engraving of Washington
and his generals hangs next to an engraving of a session of the Great
Parliament of Ireland. Eventually Old John covered practically every
square inch of wall space between wainscot and ceiling with pictures and
souvenirs. They are still in good condition, although spiders have
strung webs across many of them. New customers get up on chairs and
spend hours studying them.</p>
<p>Although Old John did not consider himself retired until just a few
years before he died, he gave up day-in-and-day-out duty back of the bar
around 1890 and made his son, William, head bartender. Bill McSorley was
the kind of person who minds his own business vigorously. He inherited
every bit of his father’s surliness and not much of his affability. The
father was by no means a lush, but the son carried temperance to an
extreme; he drank nothing but tap water and tea, and bragged about it.
He did dip a little snuff. He was so solemn that before he was thirty
several customers had settled into the habit of calling him Old Bill. He
worshipped his father, but no one was aware of the profundity of his
worship until Old John died. After the funeral, Bill locked the saloon,
went upstairs to the family flat, pulled the shutters to, and did not
come out for almost a week. Finally, on a Sunday morning, gaunt and
silent, he came downstairs with a hammer and a screwdriver and spent the
day painstakingly securing his father’s pictures and souvenirs to the
walls; they had been hung hit or miss on wires, and customers had a
habit of taking them down. Subsequently he commissioned a Cooper Union
art teacher to make a small painting of Old John from a photograph. Bill
placed it on the wall back of the bar and thereafter kept a hooded
electric light burning above it, a pious custom that is still
observed.</p>
<p>Throughout his life Bill’s principal concern was to keep McSorley’s
exactly as it had been in his father’s time. When anything had to be
changed or repaired, it appeared to pain him physically. For twenty
years the bar sagged in the middle like a plough mule’s back. A
carpenter warned him repeatedly that it was about to collapse; finally,
in 1933, he told the carpenter to go ahead and prop it up. While the
work was in progress he sat at a table in the back room with his head in
his hands and got so upset he could not eat for several days. In the
same year the smoke- and cobweb-encrusted paint on the ceiling began to
flake off and float to the floor. After customers complained that they
were afraid the flakes they found in their ale might strangle them to
death, he grudgingly had the ceiling repainted. In 1925 he had to switch
to earthenware mugs; most of the pewter ones had been stolen by souvenir
hunters. In the same year a coin-box telephone, which he would never
answer himself, was installed in the back room. These were about the
only major changes he ever allowed. Occasionally one of the pictures his
father had hung would fall off the wall and the glass would break, and
he would fill in the gap. His contributions include a set of portraits
of the wives of Presidents through the first Mrs. Woodrow Wilson, a
poster of Barney Oldfield in a red racing car, and a poem called “The
Man Behind the Bar.” He knew this poem by heart and particularly liked
the last verse:</p>
<p>When St. Peter sees him coming he will leave the gates ajar,</p>
<p>For he knows he’s had his hell on earth, has the man behind the
bar.</p>
<p>As a businessman, Bill was anachronous; he hated banks, cash
registers, bookkeeping, and salesmen. If the saloon became crowded, he
would close up early, saying, “I’m getting too confounded much trade in
here.” Agents for the brewery from which he bought his ale often tried
to get him to open a checking account; he stubbornly continued to pay
his ale bills with currency, largely silver. He would count out the
money four or five times and hand it to the driver in a paper bag. Bill
was an able bartender. He understood ale; he knew how to draw it and how
to keep it, and his bar pipes were always clean. In warm weather he made
a practice of chilling the mugs in a tub of ice; even though a customer
nursed an ale a long time, the chilled earthenware mug kept it cool.
Except during prohibition, the rich, wax-colored ale sold in McSorley’s
always has come from the Fidelio Brewery on First Avenue; the brewery
was founded two years before the saloon. In 1934, Bill sold this brewery
the right to call its ale McSorley’s Cream Stock and gave it permission
to use Old John’s picture on the label; around the picture is the legend
“As brewed for McSorley’s Old Ale House.” During prohibition McSorley’s
ale was produced mysteriously in a row of washtubs in the cellar by a
retired brewer named Barney Kelly, who would come down three times a
week from his home in the Bronx. On these days the smell of malt and wet
hops would be strong in the place. Kelly’s product was raw and
extraordinarily emphatic, and Bill made a practice of weakening it with
near beer. In fact, throughout prohibition Bill referred to his ale as
near beer, a euphemism which greatly amused the customers. One night a
policeman who knew Bill stuck his head in the door and said, “I seen a
old man up at the corner wrestling with a truck horse. I asked him what
he’d been drinking and he said, ‘Near beer in McSorley’s.’ ” The
prohibition ale cost fifteen cents, or two mugs for a quarter. Ale now
costs a dime a mug.</p>
<p>Bill was big and thick-shouldered, but he did not look strong; he had
a shambling walk and a haggard face and always appeared to be
convalescing from something. He wore rusty-black suits and black bow
ties; his shirts, however, were surprisingly fancy—they were silk, with
candy stripes. He was nearsighted, the saloon was always dimly lit, and
his most rigid conviction was that drink should not be sold to minors;
consequently he would sometimes peer across the bar at a small-sized
adult and say, “Won’t sell you nothing, bud. Get along home, where you
belong.” Once he stared for a long time at a corner of the saloon and
suddenly shouted, “Take your foot off that table!” Evidently he had been
staring at a shadow; no one was sitting in the corner. Bill was
tyrannical. Reading a newspaper, he would completely disregard a line of
customers waiting to be served. If a man became impatient and demanded a
drink, Bill would look up angrily and shout obscene remarks at him in a
high, nasal voice. Such treatment did not annoy customers but made them
snicker; they thought he was funny. In fact, despite Bill’s bad
disposition, many customers were fond of him. They had known him since
they were young men together and had grown accustomed to his quirks.
They even took a wry sort of pride in him, and when they said he was the
gloomiest, or the stingiest, man in the Western Hemisphere there was
boastfulness in their voices; the more eccentric he became, the more
they respected him. Sometimes, for the benefit of a newcomer, one of
these customers would show Bill off, shouting, “Hey, Bill, lend me fifty
dollars!” or “Hey, Bill, there ain’t no pockets in a shroud!” Such
remarks usually provoked an outburst of gamy epithets. Then the customer
would turn proudly to the newcomer and say, “See?” When prohibition
came, Bill simply disregarded it. He ran wide open. He did not have a
peephole door, nor did he pay protection, but McSorley’s was never
raided; the fact that it was patronized by a number of Tammany
politicians and minor police officials probably gave it immunity.</p>
<p>Bill never had a fixed closing hour but locked up as soon as he began
to feel sleepy, which was usually around ten o’clock. Just before
closing he would summon everybody to the bar and buy a round. This had
been his father’s custom and he faithfully carried it on, even though it
seemed to hurt him to do so. If the customers were slow about finishing
the final drink, he would cough fretfully once or twice, then drum on
the bar with both fists and say, “Now, see here, gents! I’m under no
obligoddamnation to stand here all night while you baby them drinks.”
Whenever Bill completely lost his temper he would jump up and down and
moan piteously. One night in the winter of 1924 a feminist from
Greenwich Village put on trousers, a man’s topcoat, and a cap, stuck a
cigar in her mouth, and entered McSorley’s. She bought an ale, drank it,
removed her cap, and shook her long hair down on her shoulders. Then she
called Bill a male chauvinist, yelled something about the equality of
the sexes, and ran out. When Bill realized he had sold a drink to a
woman, he let out a cross between a moan and a bellow and began to jump
up and down as if his heels were on fire. “She was a woman!” he yelled.
“She was a goddamn woman!”</p>
<p>VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER</p>

Laughing in the Face of Disability</a></p>
<p>Bill was deaf, or pretended to be; even so, ordinary noises seemed to
bother him unduly. The method he devised to keep the saloon tranquil was
characteristic of him. He bought a fire-alarm gong similar to those used
in schools and factories and screwed it to the seven-foot-tall icebox
behind the bar. If someone started a song, or if the old men sitting
around the stove began to yell at each other, he would shuffle over to
the gong and give the rope a series of savage jerks. The gong is there
yet and is customarily sounded at a quarter to midnight as a warning
that closing time is imminent; the customers grab their ears when it
goes off. Bill was consistent in his aversion to noise; he didn’t even
like the sound of his own voice. He was able to go for days without
speaking, answering all questions with a snort or a grunt. A man who
drank in McSorley’s steadily for sixteen years once said that in that
time Bill spoke exactly four intelligible words to him. They were
“Curiosity killed the cat.” The man had politely asked Bill to tell him
the history of a pair of rusty convict shackles on the wall. He learned
later that a customer who had fought in the Civil War had brought them
back from a Confederate prison in Andersonville, Georgia, and had given
them to Old John as a souvenir.</p>
<p>Bill would sometimes take an inexplicable liking to a customer.
Around 1911 a number of painters began hanging out in McSorley’s. Among
them were John Sloan, George Luks, Glenn O. Coleman, and Stuart Davis,
the abstractionist. They were all good painters, they did not put on
airs, and the workingmen in the saloon accepted them as equals. One
night, Hippolyte Havel, the anarchist, came in with the painters. Havel
was a long-haired, myopic, gentle-mannered Czech whose speeches often
got him in trouble with the police. Even Bill was curious about him.
“What’s that crazy-looking feller do for a living?” he asked one of the
painters. Playing safe, the painter said Havel was a politician, more or
less. Havel liked the place and became a steady customer. Most nights,
after making a fiery speech in Union Square, he would hurry down to
McSorley’s. To the amazement of the old-timers, a strong friendship grew
up between him and Bill, who was a Tammany Democrat and an utter
reactionary; no one was ever able to figure out the basis of the
friendship. Bill called the anarchist Hippo and would let him have
credit up to two dollars; other customers were not allowed to charge so
much as a nickel cigar. Bill had an extremely vague idea about Havel’s
politics. Charles Francis Murphy, the Tammany boss, occasionally dropped
in, and once Bill told Havel he was going to speak a good word to the
boss for him. “Maybe he’ll put you in line for something,” Bill said.
The anarchist, who thought no man was as foul as a Tammany boss, smiled
and thanked him. A police captain once took it upon himself to warn Bill
against Havel. “You better keep your eyes on that long-haired nut,” he
said. “Why?” asked Bill. The question annoyed the police captain. “Hell
fire, man,” he said, “Havel’s an anarchist! He’s in favor of blowing up
every bank in the country.” “So am I,” said Bill. Bill’s friendship for
Havel was extraordinary in every way. As a rule, he reserved his
kindness for cats. He owned as many as eighteen at once and they had the
run of the saloon. He fed them on bull livers put through a sausage
grinder and they became enormous. When it came time to feed them, he
would leave the bar, no matter how brisk business was, and bang on the
bottom of a tin pan; the fat cats would come loping up, like leopards,
from all corners of the saloon.</p>
<p>Bill had been married but was childless, and he used to say, “When I
go, this place goes with me.” In March, 1936, however, he changed his
mind— why, no one knows—and, to the surprise of the veteran customers,
sold both saloon and tenement to Daniel O’Connell, an old policeman,
who, since 1900, had spent most of his leisure at a table in the back
room. O’Connell retired from the Department two days before he purchased
the saloon. He was the kind of man of whom people say, “If he can’t
speak a good word about you, he won’t speak a bad one.” He was almost as
proud of the saloon’s traditions as Bill and willingly promised he would
make no changes; that was one of the conditions of the sale. Almost from
the day Bill sold out, his health began to fail. He took a room in the
house of a relative in Queens. Sometimes, in the afternoon, if the
weather was good, he would shuffle into the bar, a sallow, disenchanted
old man, and sit in the Peter Cooper chair with his knotty hands limp in
his lap. For hours he would sit and stare at the painting of Old John.
The customers were sure he was getting ready to die, but when he came in
they would say, “You looking chipper today, Billy boy,” or something
like that. He seemed grateful for such remarks. He rarely spoke, but
once he turned to a man he had known for forty years and said, “Times
have changed, McNally.” “You said it, Bill,” McNally replied. Then, as
if afraid he had been sentimental, Bill coughed, spat, and said,
irrelevantly, “The bread you get these days, it ain’t fit to feed a
dog.” On the night of September 21, 1938, barely thirty-one months after
he quit drawing ale, he died in his sleep. As close as his friends could
figure it, his age was seventy-six.</p>
<p>The retired policeman made a gentle saloonkeeper. Unlike Bill, he
would never throw a quarrelsome drunk into the street but would try to
sober him up with soup. “If a man gets crazy on stuff I sold him, I
can’t kick him out,” he said one day. “That would be evading my
responsibility.” He was proprietor for less than four years. He died
last December 8th and left the property to a daughter, Mrs. Dorothy
O’Connell Kirwan. A young woman with great respect for tradition,
Mrs. Kirwan has chosen to remain completely in the background. At first
customers feared that she would renovate the place, but they now realize
that this fear was groundless. “I know exactly how my father felt about
McSorley’s,” Mrs. Kirwan said recently, “and no changes will be made. So
long as I am owner, the rule against women customers will remain in
force.” She herself has visited the saloon only twice, and then on
Sunday nights after hours. She appointed a brother-in-law, Joe Nida,
manager and retained the old bartenders, Eddie Mullins and Joe
Martoccio. Mike, the cook, a Ukrainian, was also retained. The most
important member of the staff of McSorley’s, however, is not actually an
employee. His name is Tommy Kelly, and he is called Kelly the
Floorwalker. He is not related to Barney Kelly, the prohibition brewer.
Since around 1904, Kelly has acted as a sort of volunteer potboy and
master of ceremonies. During prohibition, Bill had him on the payroll,
but most of the time he has worked for the pleasure of it. When business
is brisk, he totes mugs from the bar to the tables; also, he makes an
occasional trip to the butcher for Mike. In the winter he keeps a fire
going. When he shows up, around 8:30 A.M., he is just an average,
sad-eyed little man with a hangover, but by noon lukewarm ale has given
him a certain stateliness; by six he is in such a good humor that he
stands near the door and shakes hands with incoming customers just as if
he were the proprietor. Strangers think he is the proprietor and call
him Mr. McSorley. Technically, Kelly is a truck-driver, but he always
says business is slow in his line. Once, for a brief period, he took a
job as night clerk in a funeral parlor in Brooklyn, quitting because a
corpse spoke to him. “This dead guy told me to take my hat off indoors,”
Kelly says. In one way or another, death pops up repeatedly in Kelly’s
talk. Each morning, Mullins, the bartender, asks him how he feels. If he
doesn’t feel so good, he says, “I’m dead, but I just won’t lie still.”
Otherwise he says, “For a old drunk with one leg in the grave and not a
penny to his name, I can’t complain.”</p>
<p>To a steady McSorley customer, most other New York saloons seem
feminine and fit only for college boys and women; the atmosphere in them
is so tense and disquieting that he has to drink himself into a coma in
order to stand it. In McSorley’s, the customers are self-sufficient;
they never try to impress each other. Also, they are not competitive. In
other saloons if a man tells a story, good or bad, the man next to him
laughs perfunctorily and immediately tries to tell a better one. It is
possible to relax in McSorley’s. For one thing, it is dark and gloomy,
and repose comes easy in a gloomy place. Also, there is a thick, musty
smell that acts as a balm to jerky nerves; it is really a rich compound
of the smells of pine sawdust, tap drippings, pipe tobacco, coal smoke,
and onions. A Bellevue interne once said that for many mental
disturbances the smell in McSorley’s is more beneficial than
psychoanalysis. It is an utterly democratic place. A mechanic in greasy
overalls gets as much attention as an executive from Wanamaker’s. The
only customer the bartenders brag about is Police Inspector Matthew J.
McGrath, who was a shot-and hammer-thrower in four Olympics and is
called Mighty Matt.</p>
<p>At midday, McSorley’s is crowded. The afternoon is quiet. At six, it
fills up with men who work in the neighborhood. Most nights there are a
few curiosity-seekers in the place. If they behave themselves and don’t
ask too many questions, they are tolerated. The majority of them have
learned about the saloon through John Sloan’s paintings. Between 1912
and 1930, Sloan did five paintings, filled with detail, of the
saloon—“McSorley’s Bar,” which shows Bill presiding majestically over
the tap and which hangs in the Detroit Institute of Arts; “McSorley’s
Back Room,” a painting of an old workingman sitting at the window at
dusk with his hands in his lap, his pewter mug on the table; “McSorley’s
at Home,” which shows a group of argumentative old-timers around the
stove; “McSorley’s Cats,” in which Bill is preparing to feed his drove
of cats; and “McSorley’s, Saturday Night,” which was painted during
prohibition and shows Bill passing out mugs to a crowd of rollicking
customers. Every time one of these appears in an exhibition or in a
newspaper or magazine, there is a rush of strangers to the saloon.
“McSorley’s Bar” was reproduced in Thomas Craven’s “A Treasury of Art
Masterpieces,” which came out last winter, and there have been many
strangers in the saloon since. Last November there was a retrospective
exhibition of Sloan’s work in Wanamaker’s art department, and a number
of McSorley patrons attended it in a body. One asked a clerk for the
price of “McSorley’s Cats.” “Three thousand dollars,” he was told. He
believed the clerk was kidding him and is still indignant. Kelly likes
the Sloan paintings but prefers a golden, corpulent nude which Old John
hung in the back room many years ago, right beside Peter Cooper’s
portrait. To a stranger, attracted to the saloon by a Sloan painting,
Kelly will say, “Hey, Mac, if you want to see some real art, go look at
the naked lady in the back room.” The nude is stretched out on a couch
and is playing with a parrot; the painting is a copy, probably done by a
Cooper Union student, of Gustave Courbet’s “La Femme au Perroquet.”
Kelly always translates this for strangers. “It’s French,” he says
learnedly. “It means ‘Duh Goil and duh Polly.’ ”</p>
<p>McSorley’s bar is short, accommodating approximately ten elbows, and
is shored up with iron pipes. It is to the right as you enter. To the
left is a row of armchairs with their stiff backs against the
wainscoting. The chairs are rickety; when a fat man is sitting in one,
it squeaks like new shoes every time he takes a breath. The customers
believe in sitting down; if there are vacant chairs, no one ever stands
at the bar. Down the middle of the room is a row of battered tables.
Their tops are always sticky with spilled ale. In the centre of the room
stands the belly stove, which has an isinglass door and is exactly like
the stoves in Elevated stations. All winter Kelly keeps it red hot.
“Warmer you get, drunker you get,” he says. Some customers prefer mulled
ale. They keep their mugs on the hob until the ale gets hot as coffee. A
sluggish cat named Minnie sleeps in a scuttle beside the stove. The
floor boards are warped, and here and there a hole has been patched with
a flattened-out soup can. The back room looks out on a blind tenement
court. In this room are three big, round dining-room tables. The kitchen
is in one corner of the room; Mike keeps a folding boudoir screen around
the gas range, and pots, pans, and paper bags of groceries are stored on
the mantelpiece. While he peels potatoes, he sits with early customers
at a table out front, holding a dishpan in his lap and talking as he
peels. The fare in McSorley’s is plain, cheap, and well cooked. Mike’s
specialties are goulash, frankfurters and sauerkraut, and hamburgers
blanketed with fried onions. He scribbles his menu in chalk on a slate
which hangs in the barroom and consistently misspells four dishes out of
five. There is no waiter. During the lunch hour, if Mike is too busy to
wait on the customers, they grab plates and help themselves out of the
pots on the range. They eat with their hats on and they use toothpicks.
Mike refers to food as “she.” For example, if a customer complains that
the goulash is not as good as it was last Wednesday, he says, “No matter
how not as good she is, she’s good enough for you.”</p>
<p>The saloon opens at eight. Mike gives the floor a lick and a promise
and throws on clean sawdust. He replenishes the free-lunch platters with
cheese and onions and fills a bowl with cold, hard-boiled eggs, five
cents each. Kelly shows up. The ale truck makes its delivery. Then, in
the middle of the morning, the old men begin shuffling in. Kelly calls
them “the steadies.” The majority are retired laborers and small
businessmen. They prefer McSorley’s to their homes. A few live in the
neighborhood, but many come from a distance. One, a retired operator of
a chain of Bowery flophouses, comes in from Sheepshead Bay practically
every day. On the day of his retirement, this man said, “If my savings
hold out, I’ll never draw another sober breath.” He says he drinks in
order to forget the misery he saw in his flophouses; he undoubtedly saw
a lot of it, because he often drinks twenty-five mugs a day, and
McSorley’s ale is by no means weak. Kelly brings the old men their
drinks. To save him a trip, they usually order two mugs at a time. Most
of them are quiet and dignified; a few are eccentrics. About twelve
years ago one had to leap out of the path of a speeding automobile on
Third Avenue; he is still furious. He mutters to himself constantly.
Once, asked what he was muttering about, he said, “Going to buy a
shotgun and stand on Third Avenue and shoot at automobiles.” “Are you
going to aim at the tires?” he was asked. “Why, hell no!” he said. “At
the drivers. Figure I could kill four or five before they arrested me.
Might kill more if I could reload fast enough.”</p>
<p>Only a few of the old men have enough interest in the present to read
newspapers. These patrons sit up front, to get the light that comes
through the grimy street windows. When they grow tired of reading, they
stare for hours into the street. There is always something worth looking
at on Seventh Street. It is one of those East Side streets completely
under the domination of kids. While playing stickball, they keep great
packing-box fires going in the gutter; sometimes they roast mickies in
the gutter fires. Drunks reel over from the Bowery and go to sleep in
doorways, and the kids give them hotfoots with kitchen matches. In
McSorley’s the free-lunch platters are kept at the end of the bar nearer
the street door, and several times every afternoon kids sidle in, snatch
handfuls of cheese and slices of onion, and dash out, slamming the door.
This never fails to amuse the old men.</p>
<p>The stove overheats the place and some of the old men are able to
sleep in their chairs for long periods. Occasionally one will snore, and
Kelly will rouse him, saying, “You making enough racket to wake the
dead.” Once Kelly got interested in a sleeper and clocked him. Two hours
and forty minutes after the man dozed off, Kelly became uneasy—“Maybe he
died,” he said—and shook him awake. “How long did I sleep?” the man
asked. “Since the parade,” Kelly said. The man rubbed his eyes and
asked, “Which parade?” “The Paddy’s Day parade, two years ago,” Kelly
said scornfully. “Jeez!” the man said. Then he yawned and went back to
sleep. Kelly makes jokes about the regularity of the old men. “Hey,
Eddie,” he said one morning, “old man Ryan must be dead!” “Why?” Mullins
asked. “Well,” Kelly said, “he ain’t been in all week.” In summer they
sit in the back room, which is as cool as a cellar. In winter they grab
the chairs nearest the stove and sit in them, as motionless as
barnacles, until around six, when they yawn, stretch, and start for
home, insulated with ale against the dreadful loneliness of the old.
“God be wit’ yez,” Kelly says as they go out the door. </p>
