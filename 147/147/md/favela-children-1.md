# Favela Children I

## by Ute Craemer


**Diary 1965 - 1967**

Antwerp, August 20, 1965

Rudely awakened at five in the morning by the noise of the ship being
unloaded, jumped out of bed, put on jeans and a sweater and went out on
deck. I watched the unloading of meat from Argentina and then took a
stroll through the harbor area where I discovered a wonderful Flemish
Gothic church.

Le Havre, August 25

We\'ve started to save money and now use the menus as post-cards. It
feels as though we\'re on vacation and it takes a great mental effort to
realize that in three weeks we\'ll be working in the favelas. But now
we\'re being drowsily rocked on deck by long, softly rolling waves.

At sea between Le Havre and Vigo (Spain), August 26

A storm today! Waves all around, unbridled, spraying water on deck and a
wavelet in our cabin. Quite fitting for Biscaya. Wrapped in leather
coats, our bodies at a 45-degree angle, we went for a \"stroll\" on the
deck of the Laennec.

Lisbon, August 27

We sweat in a Portuguese café‚ tired from the heat, which is gradually
taking on Brazilian characteristics, and try out our newly acquired
Portuguese phrases for the first time. Portugal is a true developing
country -- wonderful flowering gardens and villas, liberally laid out
streets, beautiful Gothic churches from Portugal\'s heyday. And,
alongside them, beggars scavenging, abandoned children. It seems not
quite European. But it probably depends on your perspective. Coming from
Brazil, the fact that one gets a feeling of history and tradition
because of the churches and monuments makes it part of Europe.

Today we leave Europe!

Rio de Janeiro, September 7, 1965

After the ten-day Atlantic crossing we are feverish to have land under
our feet again. Rio, the *cidade maravilhosa* (wonderful city), is in
sight under a blue veil of haze. Miles of white beach devoid of life.
Seemingly hostile forests cover the mountains in the background. It\'s
difficult to imagine the nearby metropolis. Entry into the harbor is
really beautiful: the Sugarloaf, the many inlets and islands, behind
them the skyscrapers of Copacabana and, like a frame, the thick rain
forest with its unknown trees surging exuberantly up the mountains from
the sea. The first impression is of an American city lost in the
tropics. The \"white\" face of Brazil is the first to be seen. The black
one presents itself immediately afterwards. however, in the form of the
many black workers who unload our ship.

*Estamos chegando ...o Rio*. (We are arriving in Rio.) The phrase from
our language book has become reality.

Santos, September 11

We left the Laennec for good and have been hanging around Santos for two
days, ill-humored and numb, with our crates and suitcases. Yesterday the
customs officials ransacked my lovingly packed bags and temporarily
confiscated my tape recorder. Finally Nivea cream and Otto\'s opera
records served as bribes. Tomorrow we continue by bus, a twelve-hour
drive to the interior, to Londrina.

Londrina, mid-September, 1965

Our reception here was touching: the house was decorated with little
flags, a rocket was launched as we descended from the jeep; three
children, fit representatives of racial mixture, one blond, the other
brown and a third black, gave us flowers. Fray Nereu, a Franciscan monk
who has taken on the favela\'s sanitation problems, gave an impassioned
speech full of genuine Latin pathos. All this under the eyes of
television and the Londrina newspaper, in which we are to be admired on
the front page of today\'s edition.

The day before yesterday the bishop of Londrina was here in all his
finery, including lilac stockings, and last night the criminal police
inspector came to visit and offer us his services - you can never know!
He learned from the newspaper that we were living in Londrina\'s worst
quarter. Right behind our favela is one of Brazil\'s most infamous
red-light districts. Whereas in the favela the women only show their
breasts when nursing infants, the women in that district do so while the
men pass through on their way to work, even when in the company of the
priest. As the police inspector make a very unpleasant impression - he
is of German descent and looks like a Nazi storm trooper - we believed
only half of what he told us about the many gangsters, muggings and
robberies here. As far as we can tell so far, the favelas are not
meeting places for criminal elements. The *favelados* are simply poor
due to lack of employment and schooling; and they are possessed by an
irrepressible wanderlust that pushes them on to another city with all
they own as soon as they have earned enough money.

I must tell the story of the rats. Our house previously belonged to a
Japanese *fazendeiro* (farmland owner) who disappeared when his debts
became too big. The house stood empty for many years and the cellar
became the undisturbed meeting place for Londrina\'s animal world.
During the second night, awakened by a scratching sound, I carefully
switched on the light and saw a fat rat scramble away from a carrot a
foot from my head. I ran to our men who, armed with a broom and club,
drove the wildly scurrying creature away. I was far from calm however,
as the beast had bored a hole through the floor from the cellar and was
surely only the advance guard of an army. The animal life in our house
is active indeed: flying, clothes-eating cockroaches, hordes of
mosquitoes, mice, a hairy poisonous spider, fleas and beetles.

The favela is depressingly poor, but even such poverty is relative; the
favelas in Rio or the slums in India are worse. Even the poorest seem to
have someone poorer than themselves. Horrible holes serve as dwellings
for countless children and their parents. A family of five lives in a
discarded bus together with chickens, a dog, a sewing machine and an
open cooking fire. The father gets up every morning a 4 a.m. to collect
scrap paper from the street and sell it. They came, as did most of the
favela residents, from Brazil\'s impoverished northeast. The favela
residents aren\'t anti-social, but simply poor people who, because of
their low income, cannot afford decent housing and therefore nail
together huts made of boards on the edge of the city. The wives\'
additional income doesn\'t suffice for a better life. Many women and
children work at picking coffee beans. They earn about a dollar for a
thirty-pound sack of beans. I only realized how tiring and time
consuming this work is when I tried it myself.

The men mostly work as unskilled laborers in factories where they
receive the legal minimum wage of fifty dollars a month, or as
coffee-bag carriers in the warehouses. (The faster you can run with a
sack the more you earn.) Or they sell fruit, sweets and roasted peanuts
on the street.

The racial mixture is unimaginable, although in the favela the majority
is black. One sees Negroid kinky hair in blond editions, or Blacks with
slanted Mongoloid eyes, or Aryan blue eyes. Besides these hybrids, there
are also the more or less \"racially pure\" Spanish, Hungarian, Italian,
Russian and German favelados - the jetsam of various immigration waves.
And they really get along with each other. What they told us in Germany
is true: how friendly, obliging and, despite their misery, how happy
Brazilians are! During our rounds through the favela we are always
received with a smile, a cafezinho is offered (and drunk, despite the
axioms learned about \"tropical hygiene\"). When you take a child,
usually covered with terra roxa (red earth) and full of sores,into your
arms, contact is quickly established. We have yet to see a mistrusting
or closed face.

Londrina has about 120,000 inhabitants. The city stands (or falls) with
coffee. Thirty-five years ago, we are repeatedly told with pride, it was
all jungle here, which is hard to imagine when you look down at miles of
coffee trees from one of the city\'s skyscrapers. The jungle was so
mercilessly cleared away that the climate has changed in the last
decades \-- there is no longer a regularly occurring rainfall and the
earth threatens to erode. The mato (jungle) seems inexhaustible, but all
that remains of it are little jungle-islands. It seems that every
country must live out its own experience with soil exploitation \-- just
as today\'s youth refuses to learn from the mistakes of the older
generation. Eucalyptus trees are planted for reforestation. They grow
quickly, but exhaust the earth\'s alkaline content even more.
