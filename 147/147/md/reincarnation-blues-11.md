# Reincarnation Blues -- Canto XI

## by Frank Thomas Smith

Often I try to analyze\
the reasons for being here and now,\
today, kicking and alive,\
swearing and forgetting my solemn vow.

Once I was nothing, a bare-ass nude,\
and in not too many years to go\
again a nothing nada dude.\
That\'s the way it goes, you know.

My heart (the know-it-all) disagrees,\
and throbbing in feeling-thought decrees\
that during the past as a daring dude\
I existed, albeit, frankly, crude.

Two-legged, striving, sweating me,\
and tomorrow or a little longer maybe,\
I\'ll be back to meet you there where\
we once loved, if you still care.

Don\'t ask where, you\'ll know where when\
That woodpecker we knew pecks a riot\
On an oak tree in a Grecian glen.\
And Reincarnation Blues will softly sing it.
