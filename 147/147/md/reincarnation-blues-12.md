# Reincarnation Blues -- Canto XII

Proof of God is in the hexagon,\
It\'s not at all like the pentagon.\
If you don\'t believe me, see the bee,\
whose brain is smaller than a pea.

It never went to school to learn\
the best way to make a hive\
and yet its six-sided cells all yearn\
to keep the baby-bees alive.

The other gon is the pentagon\
whose eight-sided wall well protects\
the military-industrial-capitalist-complex:\
It\'s what back home we\'d call a con.

Proof of Mephisto is in the pentagon,\
not at all like the hexagon.\
If you don\'t believe me, see the waste-land:\
the bodies burned and buried in sand.

The bee doesn\'t know what a hexagon is,\
it worships the queen and gently gropes her;\
he\'d gladly give one if he knew how to kiss,\
as a royal drone he enjoys her chamber.

Just a word of warning, friend:\
If you believe that God\'s improbable,\
when life is over and you\'re at the end,\
He may consider *you* improbable.

Faith, Hope and Love is the way to go,\
step by step or all at once.\
Hum Reincarnation Blues, then you\'ll know;\
and that, friend, is not a hunch.
