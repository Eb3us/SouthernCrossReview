<h3>Exceptionalism Goes Global</h3>

<main>

<p class="intro">Here’s a nightmare scenario: Unable to recruit enough soldiers from
the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin takes North Korean leader Kim
Jong-un up on <a
href="https://www.businessinsider.com/north-korea-offering-russia-100k-troops-help-beat-ukraine-reports-2022-8">his
recent offer</a> to send 100,000 North Koreans to join the Russian
president’s ill-fated attempt to seize Ukraine. Kim <a
href="https://www.dailynk.com/english/north-korea-selected-workers-dispatched-eastern-ukraine/">has
also promised</a> to send North Korean workers to help rebuild that
country’s Donbas region, parts of which Russian forces have destroyed in
order to “save” it. Consider this an eerie echo of the fraternal aid
that Eastern European Communist states provided Pyongyang in the 1950s
after the devastation of the Korean War.</p>
<p>The current love connection between Russia and North Korea is
anything but unprecedented. The Kremlin has provided a succession of
Kims with military and economic support. If Putin were ultimately to
rely on so many North Korean soldiers and laborers, however, it would
mark the first time that country had returned the favor in any
significant way. As a down payment on the new relationship, Pyongyang is
already reportedly assisting Moscow’s war effort <a
href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/09/06/north-korea-russia-weapons-ukraine/">with
shipments</a> of Soviet-era rockets and ammunition.</p>
<p><span id="anchor"></span>An even tighter alliance between Moscow and
Pyongyang, now just one goose step from reality, suggests the
possibility of a future Eurasian Union of autocracies, including China
and several Central Asian states. Just a few years ago, an anti-Western
alliance making up <a
href="https://www.worldometers.info/geography/largest-countries-in-the-world/">nearly
20%</a> of the world’s landmass and roughly the same percentage of its
population would have seemed unlikely indeed. For all its autocratic
tendencies, Russia was still pretending to be a democracy then and,
together with China, maintaining reasonable economic relations with the
West. North Korea, on the other hand, was an isolated outsider,
suffering under a hereditary dictatorship and tight sanctions that
restricted its access to the global economy.</p>
<p>Now, instead of North Korea adopting the political and economic norms
of the international community, it’s surging to the front of the
illiberal pack as Kim waves his tour-guide flag to encourage others to
walk his way. Putin, for one, seems ready to enthusiastically follow his
lead. Over the last decade, after all, he’s taken steps to eliminate
Russian civil society, while creating a top-down, corporatist economy.
After ordering the invasion of Ukraine in February, the Russian leader
now faces <a
href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-07/russia-surges-past-iran-to-become-world-s-most-sanctioned-nation">the
same kind of sanctions regime</a> that plagues Pyongyang, forcing his
country to pursue its own version of <em>juche</em>, North Korea’s
philosophy of self-reliance. Both nations have largely replaced their
governing ideologies of the 1990s — communism in North Korea, democracy
in Russia — with an ugly, xenophobic nationalism.</p>
<p>At a more fundamental level, North Korea and Russia are both
exemplars of exceptionalism. From its founding after World War II, North
Korea has generally considered itself an exception to any rules
governing international conduct. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine,
meanwhile, has cemented in place Putin’s version of a new Russian
exceptionalism, meant to bury once and for all the efforts of Mikhail
Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin to bring the Soviet Union and its successor
states into greater compliance with global norms.</p>
<p>Nor are Russia and North Korea exceptional in their exceptionalism.
Thumbing a nose at international authorities has become an integral part
of a growing authoritarian populism, which has <a
href="https://tomdispatch.com/john-feffer-donald-trump-and-america-b/">manifested
itself</a> as anger at economic globalization and disenchantment with
the liberal democratic elites who have supported that project. Although
the assault on liberalism and the embrace of illiberal exceptionalism
have taken an acutely violent form in the war in Ukraine, they can be
found in less virulent but no less troubling forms in Europe (Hungary),
Asia (Myanmar), Africa (Ethiopia), and Latin America (Brazil).</p>
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1642594644/ref=nosim/?tag=tomdispatch-20"><div class="polaroid"><img class="b" src="feffer-songlands.png" alt="Songlands book cover" style="width:100%"><div class="container"><p>Buy the Book!</p></div></div></a>
<p>Ground zero for modern-day exceptionalism, however, has always been
the United States, where a longstanding bipartisan consensus holds that
America has the right to do almost anything it wants to maintain its
global hegemony. Of course, exceptionalism here is also on a spectrum,
with liberal internationalists like Joe Biden at one end and Donald
Trump, a Russian-style autocrat in the making, at the other. Put
differently, there’s a growing struggle here over the degree to which
this country should play well with others.</p>
<p>What’s taking place in Ukraine — an exceptionalist power trying to
crush a liberal internationalist system — is a version of that very same
power struggle. Indeed, the ongoing bloodbath there anticipates the kind
of carnage that could ensue in this country if Donald Trump or some
politician like him were to take the White House in 2024.</p>
<p><strong>The End of Accession?</strong></p>
<p>Nationalists hate globalization because they believe that
international bodies should not be writing the rules that constrain the
conduct of their governments.</p>
<p>In Brazil, Trump-style President Jair Bolsonaro has <a
href="https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-brazil-environment-south-america-forests-a6c347c672595611a9ce6004b59a1f79">lashed
out</a> at U.N. agencies and transnational environmental organizations
for their criticism of his laissez-faire approach to the destruction of
the Amazon rainforest. Euroskeptics like Hungary’s Viktor Orban and the
United Kingdom’s Brexiteers <a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/02/support-for-eurosceptic-parties-doubles-two-decades-across-eu">dislike</a>
having to abide by regulations from European Union (EU) headquarters in
Brussels covering everything from the size of cucumbers to the freedom
of the press. Trump famously pulled the United States out of every
international accord that came within swinging distance of <a
href="https://www.justsecurity.org/72656/reengaging-on-treaties-and-other-international-agreements-part-i-president-donald-trumps-rejection-of-international-law/">his
MAGA machete</a>, including the Paris climate agreement, the Iran
nuclear deal, and the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty.</p>
<p>Ukraine has moved in the opposite direction. After the 2014
Euromaidan protests sent its pro-Russian president, Viktor Yanukovych,
packing, the more-or-less liberal governments that followed certainly
didn’t shy away from appealing to Ukrainian nationalism. Still, they
were also willing, even eager, to submit to the rules and regulations of
external powers, at least those further to the west. The Ukrainian
political struggles of 2013-2014, after all, centered around a desire to
join the EU, support for which has recently topped <a
href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/record-number-ukrainians-support-joining-eu-backing-nato-membership-falls-poll-2022-04-05/">90%</a>.</p>
<p>Putin has, of course, held out a very different kind of membership to
Ukraine — in a Slavic brotherhood. Whatever the pluses or minuses of any
future tight partnership with Russia and neighboring Belarus, it would
flow from compliance with the parochial dictates of the Kremlin. In
other words, Ukraine has faced an all-too-stark choice: become an
unwilling partner of Russian exceptionalism or willingly accede to the
rules of the West. Given such options, it’s hardly surprising that
Euroskepticism barely registers there.</p>
<p>Nor, of course, is Ukraine the only country eager to knock on the
EU’s door. Several others are already in the queue, undoubtedly
including — <a
href="https://www.snp.org/europe-is-leaving-a-light-on-for-scotland/">if
it votes to separate</a> from the United Kingdom and its Brexiteers —
Scotland. For Europe, in response to the challenges of economic
globalization, including pressures to privatize and a potential race to
the bottom when it comes to environmental and labor regulations, the
response has been to establish a transnational system that preserves at
least some social-democratic features. And that seems like an attractive
compromise to a number of countries huddling outside the EU’s door,
exposed to the harsh winds of free trade and onerous debt.</p>
<p>But Brexit has hardly been the only challenge to the power and
breadth of the European Union. A refusal to abide by the democratically
determined policies of Brussels has united right-wing populists in
Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic, even as it’s generated <a
href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/short_news/romania-sees-increase-in-euroscepticism/">a
strong current of Euroskepticism</a> in countries like Romania. Support
for the far right — as well as the Euroskeptical left — remains strong
in France, <a
href="https://www.politico.eu/article/france-presidential-election-2022-emmanuel-macron-marine-le-pen-young-euroskeptics/">particularly
among the young</a>. A coalition of far-right parties historically
allergic to European federalism is <a
href="https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20220826-italy-s-far-right-meloni-launches-campaign-riding-high-in-the-polls">poised</a>
to take over the governance of Italy after elections later this month.
In fact, the EU faces a threat even greater than its possible
fragmentation: a hostile takeover by right-wing forces determined to
destroy the system from within.</p>
<p>Such authoritarian nationalism is on the rise elsewhere as well.
According to the <a
href="https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2022/global-expansion-authoritarian-rule">metrics</a>
of the largely government-funded research institute Freedom House, only
20% of the world’s population now lives in “free” countries. (In 2005,
it was 46%.) And of that 20%, many are in countries where authoritarian
nationalists — Trump in the United States, Marine Le Pen in France,
Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel — have a plausible chance of taking or
retaking power in the near future.</p>
<p>What a far cry from the 1990s when much of the former Soviet sphere
scrambled to join the EU after the Warsaw Pact dissolved. In that
decade, too, even China lobbied hard to join the World Trade
Organization, finally gaining Washington’s support in 1999. It was such
a golden age of United Nations conferences and international agreements
— from the U.N. Conference on Environment and Development to the Rome
statute establishing the International Criminal Court — that the name
the U.N. <a href="https://www.un.org/law/1990-1999/">chose</a> for the
1990s, the Decade of International Law, seemed extraordinarily apt.
Unfortunately, today it seems more like ancient history.</p>
<p>Of course, the need for international cooperation has hardly
disappeared. Think climate change, pandemics, and the loss of
biodiversity, to mention just three urgent crises. But any enthusiasm
for creating binding international commitments has dwindled to the
vanishing point. The 2015 Paris climate accord was voluntary.
Transnational cooperation during the Covid pandemic, beyond scientific
circles, was minimal and often undermined by <a
href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF11551">export
restrictions</a> on critical medical supplies. Nuclear arms control
agreements remain at a standstill, while the”<a
href="https://www.businessinsider.com/nuclear-modernization-plans-are-unnecessarily-costly-and-risky-2021-7">modernization</a>”
of such arsenals continues apace and military budgets <a
href="https://www.sipri.org/publications/2022/sipri-fact-sheets/trends-world-military-expenditure-2021">rise</a>
as the weapons trade <a
href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/12/6/weapons-trade-booms-as-profit-hits-record-531bn">hits
new highs</a>.</p>
<p>The 2020s are shaping up to be the Decade of the International
Scofflaw. Ukraine’s tragedy lies not just in its geography, so near to
Russia and <a
href="https://rockinst.org/blog/so-far-from-god-and-so-close-to-the-united-states/">so
far from God</a>, but in its timing. Three decades ago, after the Soviet
Union imploded, Ukraine’s desire to accede to international norms was
unremarkable and its willingness to relinquish its nuclear weapons
universally applauded. The worst response an EU application could have
engendered back then was a cold shoulder from Brussels. Today, the
desire to join Europe has led to war.</p>
<p><strong>Whither Autocracy</strong></p>
<p>Autocrats often hide behind sovereignty. China <a
href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-un-rights-china/china-tells-u-n-rights-chief-to-respect-its-sovereignty-after-xinjiang-comments-idUSKCN1LR0L0">argues</a>
that what’s happening to its Uyghur minority in Xinjiang province is
simply none of the international community’s business. North Korea <a
href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/nkorea-spent-much-642-million-nukes-2021-report-estimates-2022-06-15/">insists</a>
that it has the sovereign right to develop nuclear weapons. And, of
course, in the U.S., Donald Trump’s MAGA crew stoutly rejects snooty
foreigners passing judgment on the American attachment to fossil fuels,
border walls, and guns of all sizes.</p>
<p>Sovereignty was once the king’s prerogative; he was, after all, the
sovereign. Today’s autocrats, like Vladimir Putin, are more likely to
have been voted into office than born into the position like Kim
Jong-un. The elections that elevate such autocrats might be questionable
(and are likely to become ever more so during their reign), but popular
support is an important feature of the new authoritarianism. Putin is
currently backed by <a href="https://www.levada.ru/en/ratings/">around
80%</a> of Russians; Orban’s approval rating in Hungary <a
href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1191282/hungary-satisfaction-with-viktor-orban/">hovers
near 60%</a>; and while Donald Trump could likely win again only thanks
to voter suppression and increasingly antidemocratic features <a
href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/08/22/american-democracy-was-never-designed-to-be-democratic-eric-holder-our-unfinished-march-nick-seabrook-one-person-one-vote-jacob-grumbach-laboratories-against-democracy">baked
into</a> the American political system, millions of Americans did put
Trump in the White House in 2016 and <a
href="https://thehill.com/homenews/3610598-number-of-republicans-who-say-they-support-trump-over-gop-rise-poll/">continue
to genuinely believe</a> that he’s their savior. Bolsonaro in Brazil,
Nayib Bukele in El Salvador, Narendra Modi in India, Kais Saied in
Tunisia: they were all elected.</p>
<p>Yes, such leaders are nationalists who often act like populists in
promising all sorts of handouts and feel-good nostrums to their
supporters. But what makes today’s autocrats particularly dangerous is
their exceptionalism, their commitment to the kind of sovereignty that
existed before the creation of the United Nations, the earlier League of
Nations, or even the Treaty of Westphalia that established the modern
interstate system in Europe in 1648. Both Trump and Xi Jinping harken
back to a Golden Age all right — of rulers who counted on the
unquestioned loyalty of their subjects and exercised a dominion
unchallenged except by other monarchs.</p>
<p>Sovereignty is the ultimate trump — sorry for that! — card. It can be
used to end every argument: <em>I’m the king of this castle and my word
is law inside its walls</em>. Autocrats tend not to be team players, but
increasingly democracies are playing the sovereignty card as well. Even
Russia, in so obviously violating Ukrainian sovereignty, has done that
by arguing that Ukraine had always been part of Russia.</p>
<p>The war in Ukraine boils down to a conflict between two conceptions
of world order. The first is defined by a one-against-all
exceptionalism, the second by an all-for-one transnational cooperation.
Unfortunately, the latter has become associated with economic
globalization (which is really about ruthless competition, not global
cooperation), Davos-style political elitism (which is usually more
focused on collusion than transparent collaboration), and trans-border
migration (which results from wars, the miseries of global economic
inequality, and the ever more devastating nightmare of climate change).
Anger at these three elements of “globalism” pushes voters to support
“the other side,” most commonly an authoritarian exceptionalism rather
than an authentic internationalism.</p>
<p>The dismal endpoint of such political devolution could be a Russia
with North Korean characteristics: isolated, belligerent, and
tyrannical. Today, countries that take such a path risk the outlaw
status North Korea has enjoyed for 75 years. The question is: What
happens if, in some future moment, the outlaws constitute the
majority?</p>
<p>What’s truly frightening, however, is that this larger geopolitical
conflict is a two-front war. Even as the West unites against the Russia
that Putin built, it finds itself fighting homegrown variants of
authoritarian exceptionalism, from Trump to Orban. Think of this as the
geopolitical version of that commonplace horror-film twist: the phone
call from the serial killer that turns out to be coming from <em>within
the house</em>.</p>
<p>Can the heroine of this story, true internationalism, survive the
onslaught of lawless maniacs bent on reviving a world of unaccountable
sovereigns and promoting a war of all against all? We can only hope that
our heroine not only survives these harrowing challenges but goes on to
star in less horrifying and more edifying sequels.</p>
