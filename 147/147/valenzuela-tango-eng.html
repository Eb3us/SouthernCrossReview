<h1>Tango</h1>

<p class="intropoem">I was told:</p>
<p>In this dance hall you have to sit close to the bar, on the left near
the cash register; order a glass of wine, nothing stronger because it's
not becoming for women, don't drink beer because beer makes you want to
piss and pissing isn't for ladies either. They talk about a kid from
this neighborhood who ditched his girlfriend when he caught her leaving
the ladies room: I thought she was pure spirit, a fairy, it seems the
kid said. The girlfriend was left flat, which in this neighborhood still
has connotations of loneliness and spinsterhood, something frowned upon.
For women, that is. So I was told.</p>
<p>I'm alone and during the week I don't care, but Saturdays I like to
be with someone and be held tight. That's why I dance the tango.</p>
<p>I learned with much dedication and effort, in high-heeled shoes and a
tight skirt slit up the side. Now I go around with the classic elastic
straps in my bag, equivalent to always having my racquet with me if I
were a tennis player, but less bother. I carry the straps in my bag and
sometimes, when waiting on line at the bank or in front of some window
when they make me wait, I fondle them, carelessly, without thinking and
maybe, I don't know, I console myself with the idea that at that very
moment I could be dancing the tango instead of waiting for some
inconsiderate flunky to attend to me.</p>
<p>I know that somewhere in the city, no matter what time it is, there
will be a salon where they're dancing in the shadows. You can't know
whether it's night or day there, nobody cares whether it's night or day,
and the elastics straps can be wrapped around the instep of your street
shoes, stretched as they are from so much tramping around looking for
work.</p>
<p>Saturday nights you're looking for anything except work. So sitting
at a table close to the bar, as recommended, I wait. The key spot in
this salon is the bar, I was insistently told, that way the men can give
you the once-over on their way to the men's room. <em>They</em> can
allow themselves that luxury. They push open the swinging doors bloated
ready to burst, we're blasted by a gust of ammonia, and they come out
much relieved and ready to dance again.</p>
<p>I know now when I'm going to dance with one of them. And which one. I
detect that very slight head movement which indicates that I am the
chosen one, I recognize the invitation and if I want to accept I smile
very slightly, meaning that I accept but I don't move; he will come to
me, will offer his hand, we will stand facing each other on the edge of
the dance floor waiting for the tension to build, for the sound of the
<em>bandoneon</em> to swell until we're ready to explode and then, on
some unforeseen chord, he'll put his arm around my waist and we'll cast
off.</p>
<p>We navigate at full sail if it's a <em>milonga</em>, for the tango we
list. And our feet don't get tangled because he's wise and signals the
maneuvers by strumming on my back. If there's some new step or figure I
don't know, I improvise and sometimes I come up smelling like roses. I
let fly a foot, list to starboard, don't separate my legs more than
necessary, he steps along with elegance and I follow. At times I stop
when his middle finger lightly touches my spine. Put yourself in
neutral, woman, the <em>maestro</em> had told me -- and you should stay
frozen in mid-step so he can do his gyrations.</p>
<p>I really learned it, I was suckled on it, so to speak. All the
posturing by the men that alludes to something else. That's the tango.
And it's so beautiful that you end up accepting.</p>
<p>My name is Sandra but in these places I like to be called Sonia, so
as to endure beyond waking. Here, however, very few ask or give names,
few speak. Some do smile to themselves though, listening to that inner
music they are dancing to and which isn't always a product of nostalgia.
We, the women, also laugh and smile. I laugh when they ask me to dance
an encore (and we stand silently, sometimes smiling, on the dance floor
waiting for the next number), I laugh because this tango music oozes out
of the floor and penetrates the soles of our feet and makes us vibrate
and drags us with it.</p>
<p>I love it. The tango. And eventually the man who, transmitting the
keys of the movements with his fingers, dances with me.</p>
<p>I don't mind walking the thirty-odd blocks to get back home. Some
Saturdays I even spend my bus fare on the <em>milonga</em> and I don't
care. Some Saturdays a sound of celestial trumpets runs through the
<em>bandoneons</em> and I elevate. I fly. Some Saturdays I'm in my shoes
without needing the elastic straps, they stay on by themselves. It's
worth it. The week passes banally by and I hear the idiotic street
flirtations, those direct phrases, so petty when compared to the
obliquity of the tango.</p>
<p>Here and now, almost glued to the bar in order to master the view, I
gaze somewhat fixedly at some handsome mature guys and smile. They're
the best dancers. Let's see which one decides to move. The nod comes
from the one on the left, half hidden behind the column. A tilting nod
so delicate that he could be trying to listen to his own shoulder. I
like it. I like the man. I smile openly and only then does he stand up
and approach. You can't expect reckless haste. No one here would risk
being rejected face to face, none is prepared to return fuming to his
seat under the mocking gaze of the others. This one knows that he has me
and he moves in striding quickly, and I don't like him as much close up
with his years and his air of indifference.</p>
<p>The ruling ethics don't allow me to play innocent. I stand up, he
leads me to a somewhat distant part of the dance floor and there -- he
speaks to me! And not like that one a while back who only spoke to
excuse himself for not answering me, because I come here to dance and
not to chat, he told me, and that was the last time he opened his mouth.
No. This one is conversing, and it's exciting. He says do you see, doña,
what the crisis is like, and I say yes, I see, I damn well do see
although I don't say it in those words, I become refined, I am Sonia:
Sí, señor, how frightful, I say, but he doesn't let me elaborate the
idea because he's already holding me tight, ready to cast off at the
next beat. This one won't let me drown, I console myself, surrendering,
silenced.</p>
<p>It turns out to be a tango of pure concentration, of cosmic
comprehension. I can do the steps as I saw the one in the crochet dress
do them, the plump lady who enjoys herself so much, who wields her
shapely calves so well that one forgets the rest of her opulent anatomy.
I dance thinking of the plump lady, in her green crochet dress -- the
color of hope, they say--, in the pleasure she takes in dancing, replica
or maybe a reflection of the pleasure she must feel while knitting; a
vast dress for her vast body and the happiness to dream of the moment
when she can show it off, dancing. I don't knit, nor do I dance as well
as the plump lady, although at this moment I do, because the miracle has
happened.</p>
<p>And when the number ends and my companion comments on the crisis
again, I listen unctuously, I don't answer him, I give him time to
add:</p>
<p>"And did you see the prices they're charging for hotel rooms? I'm a
widower and live with my two sons. Before I could invite a lady to a
restaurant and foot the bill and take her later to a hotel. Now I can
only ask a lady if she has an apartment downtown. Because a chicken and
a bottle of wine is about the limit for me."</p>
<p>I remember those flying feet --mine--, the filigreed steps. I think
of the plump lady so happy with her happy man, I even sense a sincere
vocation for knitting.</p>
<p>"I don't have an apartment," I explain, "but I do have a room in a
well situated <em>pensión</em>, that's clean. And I have plates, knives
and forks, and two green glasses, those tall thin ones."</p>
<p>"Green? They're for white wine."</p>
<p>"White, yes."</p>
<p>"Sorry, but I never touch white wine."</p>
<p>And we separate without even one more dance.</p>
