          >In these 14 lectures, given at the end of 1917 following four years
          of war in Europe, Steiner speaks of the complex spiritual forces
          behind the Great War, humanity's attempts to build theoretically
          perfect social orders, and the many divisions and disruptions that
          would continue to occur on earth in our time. Humanity in general was
          asleep to the fact that fallen spirits, cast out of the spiritual
          worlds, had become intensely active on earth. This manifested
          particularly in people's thinking and in their perception of the world
          about them. But the defeat and fall of these spirits also ensured that
          a science of the spirit would always be available to humanity. These
          lectures given at Dornach, Switzerland in September and October of
          1917, are from the lecture series entitled: The Spiritual Background
          of the External World ... In the Complete Edition of the works of
          Rudolf Steiner the original German text is published with the title:
          Die Spirituellen Hintergruende der Aeusseren Welt. Der Sturz der
          Geister der Finsternis. Geistige Wesen und ihre Wirkungen. (No. 177 in
          the Bibliographic Survey, 1961). The original translation was from
          shorthand reports unrevised by the lecturer.</em

      <h3>The Spirits of Light and the Spirits of Darkness</h3>
      <h3>Lecture 12</h3>
      <p style="font-weight: bold">October 1917</p>
      <p class="intro">
        The event I have been referring to in the preceding lectures, the
        occasion when certain spirits of darkness were cast out of the spiritual
        realm and down into the human realm in the autumn of 1879, holds great
        importance. We have to reflect again and again what it really means to
        say that a battle raged for decades in the spiritual realms. The battle
        started in the early 1840s and ended when certain spiritual entities,
        which had been acting like rebels in the spiritual world during those
        decades, were vanquished in the autumn of 1879 and cast down as dark
        spirits into the realm of human evolution. They are now among us and the
        effect of this is that they send their impulses into our view of the
        world, not only into the way we think about the world, but also into our
        inner feelings, our will impulses and even our temperaments. Human
        beings will be unable to get even a partial understanding of the
        significant events of the present time and the immediate future, unless
        they are prepared to recognize the relationship which exists between the
        physical world and the spiritual world and take as much account of
        important events like this as they do of natural phenomena. At the
        present time people generally give validity only to natural phenomena,
        phenomena of the physical world which are part of historical evolution.
        They will have to give validity again to spiritual events, which can be
        perceived with the aid of spiritual science, for only then can the
        events in which human beings are caught up be really understood.
      </p>
      <p>
        With reference to this important event it is quite easy to establish how
        seriously people are in error if they base themselves only on concepts
        and definitions when considering the world and not on direct observation
        of reality. One always has the feeling one ought to base oneself on
        defined concepts — what is Ahriman, what is Lucifer, what are the
        particular spirits in one hierarchy or another? Those are the questions
        we ask, and we believe that having got the definitions we have also
        understood something about the way these entities work. An extreme
        example of the inadequacy of definitions is the following, which I have
        quoted before. It may not have been the ideal way of defining the human
        being, but it is the definition which was given in a school in Greece: A
        human being is a creature who walks on two legs and does not have
        feathers. The next time the pupil came to school he brought a plucked
        cockerel: a creature who walked on two legs and had no feathers. This is
        a human being, he said, according to the definition.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many definitions of this kind are generally accepted, and many of our
        scientific definitions are therefore more or less in accord with the
        truth. We must not base ourselves on such definitions in anthroposophy,
        however. Perception will be poor if we base ourselves on abstract
        definitions. Yes, it is possible to define the term ‘spirits of
        darkness’, but this will not get us far. Spirits of darkness were cast
        down from heaven to earth in 1879. This may give a general idea of the
        spirits of darkness, but it does not get us far in understanding the
        real issue. The spirits of darkness now walking among us are of the same
        kind as the spirits of darkness which had been cast down from the
        spiritual world, that is from heaven to earth, in earlier times; they
        had specific tasks to perform during the whole of the Atlantean age and
        right into Graeco-Latin times.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let us try to use the different insights we have gained and determine
        the task those spirits of darkness had to perform through millennia,
        through the whole Atlantean age and on into Graeco-Latin times. It has
        to be kept in mind that the great scheme of things will only work if
        higher spiritual entities who have the task of guiding human evolution
        make use of such spirits, putting them in the right place, as it were,
        to enable them to do what is necessary. As you will remember, the
        ‘luciferic temptation’ of old held major significance for human
        evolution. It did, of course, arise from Lucifer's specific aims — and
        from Atlantean times onwards Lucifer was in league with Ahriman. These
        aims gave rise to counter-aims of, let us call them ‘good spirits’, the
        spirits of light. Fundamentally speaking, the spirits of darkness also
        wanted the best for humanity in those early times, they wanted human
        beings to have the capacity for absolute freedom; but humanity was not
        ready for this at the time. They wanted to provide humanity with
        impulses which would make every human being an independent individual.
        It was not to be, however, for humanity was not yet ready.
      </p>
      <p>
        A counter-force had to be set up by the spirits of light; this was done
        by taking human beings from the heights of the Spirit and putting them
        on to the earth, which is symbolically described in the expulsion from
        Paradise. In reality, human beings were being placed in the stream of
        hereditary traits. Lucifer and the ahrimanic powers wanted every human
        being to be an independent individual. This would have meant that people
        would have become spiritual very rapidly while still immature, but it
        was not to happen. Human beings were to be educated on earth, brought to
        full development through the forces of the earth. This was achieved by
        placing them in the stream of heredity, where they would physically
        descend from others. In this way they were not independent, but
        inherited certain traits from their forebears. They were weighed down
        with earthly qualities which Lucifer did not want them to have. Anything
        to do with physical heredity was given to humanity by the spirits of
        light to counterbalance the luciferic stream. A weight was attached to
        human beings, as it were, and this connected them with the earth. In
        everything connected with heredity, with the begetting of children,
        procreation, with love in the earthly sense, we must therefore see
        ourselves connected with the entities which are under the leadership of
        Yahveh or Jehovah.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the reason why we find so many symbols of procreation and
        earthly heredity in the ancient religions. The laws of Judaism — which
        was to prepare the way for Christianity — as well as those of pagan
        religions, clearly show the importance attached to regulating everything
        to do with the laws of heredity here on earth. People had to learn to
        live together in tribes, nations and races, with blood relationship as
        the signature for the way affairs were ordered on earth.
      </p>
      <p>
        This had been in preparation during the Atlantean age and was to be
        repeated in the fourth epoch of civilization, the Graeco-Latin epoch,
        mainly on account of the measures taken in the third, Egypto-Chaldean
        epoch. We can see that specifically during epochs which were to
        recapitulate the Lemurian and Atlantean ages, account was taken of race,
        nation and tribal connections in all the ways in which human affairs
        were ordered; in short, account was taken of hereditary traits arising
        from blood bonds. The priests of the ancient Mysteries were mainly
        responsible for the ordering of affairs — today we would say for affairs
        of state — and they took care to observe the way in which customs,
        inclinations and habits had to develop in various places to take account
        of blood relationships, of people belonging to a particular nation or
        tribe. Their laws were based on this. We shall not be able to understand
        what issued from the Mysteries of the third and fourth postAtlantean
        ages unless we consider the careful study of racial, national and tribal
        relationships on which the priests based the laws they made for
        different regions of the earth. What really counted in each individual
        region was to establish order in the blood relationships.
      </p>
      <p>
        In those times, when the spirits of light made it their concern to order
        human affairs on the basis of blood relationships, the spirits of
        darkness which had been cast down from heaven to earth with humanity,
        made it their concern to work against anything connected with heredity
        through blood relationship. They were the source of all rebellion
        against ordinances based on blood relationship in those ages, and of all
        teachings of rebellion against heredity and against tribal and racial
        relationships, insisting on the independence of the individual and
        seeking to establish laws based on this, laws which did, of course, come
        from human beings but were inspired by the spirits of darkness. Those
        ages extended as far as the fifteenth century. Echoes still persist, of
        course, for systems do not come to an abrupt end when there is a major
        break in evolution. Up to the fifteenth century in particular, we see
        teachings come up which rebel against purely natural bonds, against the
        bonds of relationship, family, nationality, and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus we have two streams: the ‘protector’ of everything to do with blood
        relationship, which is the stream of light; it is opposed by the stream
        of darkness as the ‘protector’ of everything which wants to abandon the
        bonds of blood relationship and help people to be free of the bonds of
        family and heredity. All this does not, of course, come to an abrupt
        halt any more than it does in the natural world, and in 1413, the year
        when the break occurred which marks the boundary between the fourth and
        fifth post-Atlantean ages, the old ways did not stop immediately. We can
        see the influence of the two streams continuing right into our own time.
        For from the nineteenth century onwards, from the time of the
        significant events I have described to you, we see something entirely
        different emerge — I have already made some mention of this. Angelic
        spirits, members of the hierarchy of the Angels have been active among
        us since 1879. They follow on after the old spirits of darkness, are
        related to these and are of a similar kind, but have only been cast down
        from heaven to earth because of the event which occurred in 1879. Until
        then they had their function up above, whilst their relatives, who acted
        in the way I have just described, have been among human beings from
        Lemurian and Atlantean times.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus there was a break in evolution in about 747 before the Mystery of
        Golgotha; another one came in 1413 after the Mystery of Golgotha, and
        the break which is particularly important to us, in 1879.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout the whole of this time spirits of darkness were active on
        earth, whilst certain other spirits of darkness, which are related to
        those down on earth, were still in the spiritual world. 1841 saw the
        beginning of the mighty battle of which I have spoken. Then the spirits
        which are related to those others descended to join them below. The
        power of the old rebels, of the continuing stream of spirits of darkness
        who had their tasks to perform from Lemurian and Atlantean times, is
        gradually dying down as the powers of their brothers begin to take
        effect. This means that from the last third of the nineteenth century
        the situation has been completely reversed. The spirits of light who
        have been continuing in their activities have done enough where the
        establishment of blood, tribal, racial and similar bonds is concerned,
        for everything has its time in evolution. In the general and rightful
        scheme of things, enough has been done to establish what needed to be
        established through blood bonds in humanity. In more recent times,
        therefore, the spirits of light have changed their function. They now
        inspire human beings to develop independent ideas, feelings and impulses
        for freedom; they now make it their concern to establish the basis on
        which people can be independent individuals. And it is gradually
        becoming the task of the spirits who are related to the old spirits of
        darkness to work within the blood bonds.
      </p>
      <p>
        The function which was right in the past or, better said, belonged to
        the sphere of the good spirits of light, was handed over to the spirits
        of darkness during the last third of the nineteenth century, From this
        time onwards, the old impulses based on racial, tribal and national
        relationships, on the blood, became the domain of the spirits of
        darkness, who had previously been rebels in the cause of independence.
        They then began to instil ideas in human minds that affairs should be
        ordered on the basis of tribal relationships, of blood bonds.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can see that definition is impossible. If you define the spirits of
        darkness on the basis of the function they had in the past, you get
        exactly the opposite of their function in more recent times, that is
        from the last third of the nineteenth century. In the past, it was the
        function of the spirits of darkness to work against hereditary traits in
        humanity; from the last third of the nineteenth century they have been
        lagging behind, wanting to lag behind, wanting over and over again to
        make people aware of their tribal, blood and hereditary bonds and to
        insist on these.
      </p>
      <p>
        These things simply are the truth, though it is a truth which people
        today find extremely unpalatable. For millennia, human beings have
        instilled the insistence on blood bonds into themselves, and out of
        sheer inertia they are letting the spirits of darkness take control of
        these habitual ideal. We therefore see insistence on tribal, national
        and racial relationships particularly in the nineteenth century, and
        this insistence is considered idealistic, when in reality it is an early
        sign of decline in humanity. Everything based on dominance of the blood
        principle meant progress for as long as it was under the authority of
        the spirits of light; under the authority of the spirits of darkness it
        is a sign of decline. The spirits of darkness made special efforts in
        the past to implant a rebellious feeling of independence in human beings
        at the time when hereditary traits were passed on in a positive sense by
        the progressive spirits. In the three ages of human evolution which now
        follow and will continue until the time of the great catastrophe, the
        spirits of darkness will make extreme efforts to preserve the old
        hereditary characteristics and inculcate human beings with the attitudes
        which result from such preservation; in this way they introduce the
        necessary signs of decline into human evolution.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here is another point where we have to be watchful. In particular, it is
        not possible to understand the present time unless one knows the change
        of function which came in the last third of the nineteenth century. A
        fourteenth-century person who spoke of the ideals of race and nation
        would have been speaking in terms of the progressive tendencies of human
        evolution; someone who speaks of the ideal of race and nation and of
        tribal membership today is speaking of impulses which are part of the
        decline of humanity. If anyone now considers them to be progressive
        ideals to present to humanity, this is an untruth. Nothing is more
        designed to take humanity into its decline than the propagation of
        ideals of race, nation and blood. Nothing is more likely to prevent
        human progress than proclamations of national ideals belonging to
        earlier centuries which continue to be preserved by the luciferic and
        ahrimanic powers. The true ideal must arise from what we find in the
        world of the spirit, not in the blood
      </p>
      <p>
        The Christ, who is to appear in a specific form in the course of the
        twentieth century, will know nothing of the ‘ideals’ proclaimed by
        people today. In earlier times Michael, the spirit from the hierarchy of
        Archangels was the representative of Yahveh; thanks to the functions
        given to him in 1879, he will be the earthly representative, the vicar,
        of the Christ, of the Christ impulse to create spiritual bonds between
        human beings which will take the place of the purely physical blood
        bonds. For only the bonds of spiritual communion will bring a
        progressive element into the entirely natural element of decline. Please
        note, the element of decline is natural. Human beings cannot remain
        children as they get older, and their bodies then follow a downward
        curve of development. In the same way the whole of humanity has entered
        into a downward trend of development. We have passed the fourth
        post-Atlantean age and are now in the fifth; this, together with the
        sixth and seventh, will be old age in the present stage of world
        evolution. To think that old ideals can live on is no more intelligent
        than to think people should continue to learn their letters throughout
        the whole of their lives just because it is good for children to learn
        their letters. It would be equally unintelligent for people in the
        future to speak of a social structure for the whole world based on the
        blood bonds of nations. It is Wilsonianism, of course, but also
        ahrimanism — of the spirits of darkness.

      </p>
      <p>
        It is no doubt far from easy to accept the truth of this; it is easier
        today to share in the phraseologies in common use all over the world.
        Reality takes no account of phrases; it follows the true impulses. We
        shall not be able to change the labels on things which no longer hold
        true for the fifth, sixth and seventh periods, even if they are still
        being poured into Wilsonian world programmes in a form which still has
        power to convince a humanity that likes to take the easy way.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are still enough people, even today, who simply do not want to get
        to the point where they are prepared to accept such universal human
        truths, which are independent of all blood bonds. These are universal
        human truths because they have not come from the earth but have been
        brought down from the spiritual worlds. How terrible is the reaction
        already occurring as almost the whole world is resisting the true
        progress of humanity, and the phrase ‘freedom of nations’ is used for
        something which goes against the stream of evolution. It has always been
        the destiny of Mystery-truths that they have had to go against the
        stream of comfortable ease and with the stream of evolution. And we
        shall have to see if there will not be at least a small group of people
        free of all blood prejudices who are able to recognize the phraseology
        that goes round the world today, phrases signifying that something which
        in spiritual terms presents itself as the event of November 1879 is now
        coming to the surface with might and main.
      </p>
      <p>
        The events of the present time have been foreseen by the initiates of
        all nations. They were foreseen and forecast, and it was said that a
        highly reactionary mood would bubble up from the blood and people would
        believe it to be highly idealistic. We must be able to observe on the
        large scale, as in small things; we must not allow ourselves to be
        deflected by the opinions and phrases one hears in the world today. We
        have to be able to rise a little above ourselves to understand the signs
        of the times. Yes, you may choose the other road and continue in your
        blood-prejudices; you will then join the streams which lead downwards.
        These are coming. You need to know how to be watchful where they are
        concerned and oppose them with elements which follow the upward trend.
        The downward trend comes of its own accord.
      </p>
      <p>
        We must have a feeling for life on the upward and life on the downward
        trend. Do not fall prey to the foolish inclination to escape from the
        downward trend, saying, ‘I will have nothing to do with Lucifer, nor
        with Ahriman.’ I have often censured this foolish inclination, for we
        must certainly take account of the Spirits which serve the great cosmic
        scheme of things. Our failure to do so, assuming an attitude where they
        remain outside our conscious awareness, make them all the more powerful.
        We shall only be able to judge human affairs if we are able to take a
        broader view of the impulses of life in the ascendant and also in the
        descendant. It is important, however, to keep clear of sympathies and
        antipathies.

        Two streams have arisen in modern science; one of these I have called
        Goetheanism, the other Darwinism. If you study everything I have
        written, from the very beginning, you will see that I have never failed
        to recognize the profound significance of Darwinism. Some people were
        foolish enough to think I had fallen under the spell of materialism, and
        so on, when I wrote anything in favour of Darwin. We know, of course,
        that this was not from conviction, but had quite different reasons; and
        the people who say such things only need to think about it and they will
        know better than anyone else that they are not true. But if you really
        study everything I have written you will see that I have always done
        justice to Darwinism, but have done so by contrasting it with
        Goetheanism, the view of the evolution of life. I have always sought to
        see such things as the theory of descent in the Darwinian sense on the
        one hand and the Goethean on the other, and I have done so because
        Goetheanism presents the ascending line, with organic evolution raised
        above mere physical existence.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have often referred to the conversation between Goethe and Schiller.
        Goethe drew a diagram of his archetypal plant and Schiller said, ‘That
        is not empiricism — learning from experience — it is an idea.’ Goethe's
        reply was: ‘In that case I have my idea in front of my eyes!’ For he saw
        the spiritual element in everything. Goethe thus initiated a theory of
        evolution which holds the potential for elevation to the highest
        spheres, for being applied to soul and spirit. Goethe may only have made
        a start with organic evolution in his theory of metamorphosis, but we
        have the evolution of the spirit to which humanity must attain from this
        fifth post-Atlantean age onwards — for human beings are becoming more
        inward, as I have shown. Goetheanism can have a great future, for the
        whole of anthroposophy is on those lines. Darwinism considers physical
        evolution from the physical side: external impulses, struggle for
        survival, selection, and so on, and in this way outlines an evolution
        which is dying down — everything you can discover about organic life if
        you give yourself up to impulses which came up in earlier times. To
        understand Darwin, one merely has to make a synthesis of all the laws
        discovered in the past. To understand Goethe, one has to rise above this
        to laws which are ever new in earth existence. Both are necessary. It is
        not Darwinism which is the problem, nor Goetheanism, but the fact that
        people want to follow one or the other rather than one and the other.
        This is what really matters.
      </p>
      <p>
        In future, human beings, the older they get, will need to take in
        spiritual impulses if they want to be able to grow younger and younger
        and really develop their inner life. If they do so, they may have grey
        hair and wrinkles and all kinds of infirmities, but they will get
        younger and younger, for their souls are taking in impulses which they
        will take with them through the gate of death. People who relate only to
        the body cannot grow younger, for their souls will share in everything
        the body experiences. Of course, it will not be possible to change the
        habit of going grey, but it is possible for a grey head to gain a young
        soul from the wellsprings of spiritual life. This is how human evolution
        will proceed in the fifth, sixth and seventh post-Atlantean ages in
        terms of Darwin's grey-haired theory, if you will forgive the
        expression. But in order to go through the catastrophe which is
        comparable to the earth's death — the catastrophe lying ahead — people
        must gain the power of youth which lies in Goetheanism, in the theory of
        metamorphosis and of spiritual evolution. This has to be taken through
        the future catastrophe, just as in the case of the individual the
        rejuvenated soul is taken through the gate of death.
      </p>
      <p>
        Humanity was able to unite with the earth because when it came down from
        heaven to earth, if we may put it like this, the spirits of darkness
        which came down with it laid an adequate foundation for human
        independence during the time when the laws of heredity, nationality and
        race prevailed. What Lucifer and Ahriman had done became a good thing in
        so far as humanity was enabled to unite with the earth. To show this in
        diagrammatic form, we may put it like this: before Lucifer took action,
        humanity was united with the whole cosmos including the earth (see
        diagram, violet); human beings united with the earth (yellow) because
        hereditary traits — original sin in biblical terms, hereditary traits in
        scientific terminology — were implanted into them. This made human
        beings — I am using crosses to indicate them — part of the earth. You
        see, therefore, that Lucifer and Ahriman are servants of the progressive
        powers.
      </p>
      <p><img src="image1.gif" class="a" /></p>
      <p>
        Evolution then continued. We are now at the time when human beings live
        on earth and are united with it. Luciferic and ahrimanic spirits,
        spirits of darkness, have been cast down from heaven to earth. Because
        of this, human beings must be released from the earth, torn away from
        it, with part of their essential nature taken back into the spiritual
        world. Humanity must develop awareness of not being of this earth, and
        this must grow stronger and stronger. In future, human beings must walk
        on this earth who say to themselves: ‘Yes, at birth I enter into a
        physical body, but this is a transitional stage. I really remain in the
        spiritual world. I am conscious that only part of my essential nature is
        united with the earth, and that I do not leave the world where I am
        between death and rebirth with the whole of my essential nature.’ A
        feeling of belonging to the spiritual world must develop in us.
      </p>
      <p>
        In earlier years this merely cast a false shadow in so far as people did
        not want to understand physical life and practised a false asceticism,
        believing this to consist in mortifying the physical body in all kinds
        of ways. It has to be understood that it is not through false
        asceticism, but by uniting themselves with things of the Spirit, with
        the essence of things, that people will be able to perceive themselves
        as not merely earthly creatures but belonging to the whole cosmos.
        Gaining knowledge of the physical world has merely been a preparation
        for this. Just think how dependent people were on the soil where they
        had grown, as it were, right into the fifteenth century, the end of the
        Graeco-Latin epoch, and how much their development depended an the soil.
        This was good, but it must not dominate our lives now.
      </p>
      <p>
        Physical science has torn human beings away from the earth in the
        physical sense with Copernicanism, and soul awareness must also be torn
        away from the earth. The earth has become a small body in space; but
        initially this is only in terms of space. Through Copernicanism human
        beings were shifted out into the cosmos, as it were, though in entirely
        abstract terms. This must continue, but it should not be applied to
        physical life in the wrong way. The physical will take its own course.
        Take America, for instance, though not the population native to its soil
        for centuries. As you know, a new population consisting entirely of
        Europeans has arrived there in recent times. Careful observation shows
        that physical life continues to be bound to the soil. The Americans who
        are Europeans transplanted to America are gradually acquiring traits
        which recall the old Indian population — this has not yet progressed
        very far, but it is true nevertheless. The arms are a different length
        from what they were in Europe because these people have been
        transplanted to America. The physical human being does adapt to the
        soil. It even goes so far that there is now a considerable difference in
        physical form between Americans who live in the West and those who live
        in the East. This is adaptation to the soil. If the soul were to go
        along with this physical process the American Indian culture would be
        revived in time, though in a European form. This sounds paradoxical, but
        it is true. In future, humanity cannot be bound to the soil; the soul
        has to become independent. All over the world people may then assume the
        physical characteristics given by the soil, and the bodies of Europeans
        may become indianized when they go to America, but in their souls human
        beings will tear themselves away from the physical and earthly element
        and be citizens of the worlds of the spirit. And in those worlds there
        are no races or nations, but relationships of a different kind.
      </p>
      <p>
        These things must be understood today when great, tremendous events
        happen in the world, unless you are going to be mulish — excuse the
        expression — and present old-established prejudices as new ideals.

              The reference here is to U.S. President Woodrow Wilson's
              insistence that European boundries after Word War I be rigidly
              drawn according to the major ethnic populations within them.<br />
              "President Wilson's 'fourteen points' constituted the ideological
              basis for the principle of 'self-determination of peoples', which
              was to underlie the political restructuring of Europe after the
              war. This principle presupposes that ethnic groups (peoples,
              nations) are perfectly separable and definable, like so many
              individual pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. If each governs itself
              through its own national state, then the cause of political
              morality is served. In fact, Europe was and is a quilt of nations
              with many overlapping ethnic 'grey' regions. The effect of
              self-determination or the 'nationalities principle' is the
              disenfranchisement of many smaller or larger minorities with the
              resultant bitterness and frustration. The course of history since
              this principle was put into effect in Europe and elsewhere would
              seem to support such criticism. Winston Churchill wrote the
              following about the carving up of the Austro-Hungarian empire:
              "The second cardinal tragedy was the complete break-up of the
              Austro-Hungarian Empire...There is not one of these peoples or
              provinces that constituted the Empire of the Hapsburgs to whom
              gaining their independence has not brought the tortures which
              ancient poets and theologians had reserved for the damned."
              <em
                >The Second World War, Vol. 1, Chap. i, The Gathering Storm.</em
              >
              According to the idea of the 'social triformation', or 'threefold
              society', the nationalities (ethnic) problem can only be solved by
              liberating 'national' life from the power of the political state.
              In other words, the creation of a free cultural-spiritual sector.
