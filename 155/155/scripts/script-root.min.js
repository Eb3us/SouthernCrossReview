          "Edward Hopper, (July 22, 1882 - May 15, 1967) was a prominent American realist painter and printmaker. While he was most popularly known for his oil paintings, he was equally proficient as a watercolorist and printmaker in etching. Both in his urban and rural scenes, his spare and finely calculated renderings reflected his personal vision of modern American life. One of his teachers, artist Robert Henri, taught life class. Henri encouraged his students to use their art to \"make a stir in the world\". He also advised his students, \"It isn't the subject that counts but what you feel about it\" and \"Forget about art and paint pictures of what interests you in life.\" He encouraged them to imbue a modern spirit in their work. Some artists in Henri's circle, including John Sloan, became members of \"The Eight\", also known as the Ashcan School of American Art. Hopper's first existing oil painting to hint at his famous interiors was Solitary Figure in a Theater (c.1904). During his student years, he also painted dozens of nudes, still life studies, landscapes, and portraits, including his self-portraits. Not until he was 41 did he receive recognition for his work. His financial stability now secured, Hopper would live a simple, stable life and continue creating art in his distinctive style for four more decades."],

          "Society is at a point in history where it must decide upon the path it wishes to follow. A crossroads is usually thought of as an either-or decision. One road goes in one direction, the other in a different direction. Modern history has, in fact, drawn two apparently different paths: Communism or Capitalism. One part of the world chose one of these paths and came upon a dead-end, hurled itself forward and crashed into a wall, aptly symbolized in Berlin, drenched in blood and misery. The other part kept to its chosen path of Capitalism, only slightly modified, and fought to defeat or at least contain the hegemonic ambitions of the Soviets. The Communists lost and logic seems to conclude that the other path was the correct one all along, and on which the whole world must now tread. The danger of this conclusion lies in the possibility that socialist criticism of Capitalism will only lead to a repetition of the Communist or some other ideological experiment, with similar and foreseeable disastrous consequences. The fact that Communism has been found, in practice, to be worse than the evil it wished to supplant, does not necessarily mean that its criticisms of Capitalism are not, at least to a large extent, correct and that the Juancitos of the world’s suffering is indeed the result of capitalist indifference.",

Let us assume that someone is in possession of a perfect, theoretical solution to the social question.

People's minds are simply not disposed to accept the ideas of another as far as this subject is concerned.

A relatively small portion has been translated into Spanish, but what is available is more than sufficient for anyone who desires to be well informed. Literature by other authors also exists.",
          "As anthroposophy is intimately connected with Rudolf Steiner, it will be convenient to say a few words about him before going into the material itself. Steiner was born in 1861 in what was then a part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, then became Yugoslavia and is now Croatia. His father, a hunter by profession, was chief of a railroad station in a small rural town. Steiner was a gifted child, so his parents later moved close to Vienna so he could continue his studies. Aside from his intellectual capacities, he had other gifts. He could “see” elemental beings in nature, for example. When, however, he realized that no one else shared these clairvoyant experiences, he decided to remain silent about them.",

He sees how thinking, feeling and willing are dependent upon the natural human being. Where health and illness are concerned, they must follow the physical body in its strength and debilitation. Sleep extinguishes them. Life’s experiences show how dependent spiritual experience is on the physical body. One may therefore come to the conclusion that self-knowledge is lost midst these everyday experiences. Then the essential question arises: whether self-knowledge and therewith certainty about the true self beyond ordinary experience, is even possible. Anthroposophy wishes to answer this question based upon sound spiritual experience. It is not based on mere opinion or belief, but on experience of the spirit, which is as certain as the experience of the body.",

The first began with a four-hour bus ride from my home in a remote corner of Argentina to the city of Cordoba, where I entered a travel agency a few minutes after three in the afternoon and approached Luciano’s desk. He stood up, smiled automatically and held out his hand. As I took it his smile vanished as quickly as it had appeared and he said, “You traveling today…or tomorrow?” and I knew something was wrong.",

Luciano sat down and clicked away at his computer. I sat across from him and glanced at the calendar on his desk: Friday, January 8. I was about to say, Hey, Luciano, you should keep your calendar up to date and you’d know when your clients were traveling, but instead I opened the newspaper I’d bought at a kiosko outside the agency just before entering and looked at the date: Friday, January 8. My face felt hot and I was glad that Luciano was busy changing my reservation and couldn’t notice my embarrassment. I had left home a day early. It made no difference for what I had to do in Florida, except that I wanted to leave on Saturday and arrive on Sunday morning in order to rest one day and get busy on Monday. Now I’d have a Saturday on my hands. Still, it was the first time something like that had happened to me. I might misplace my glasses now and then, but a whole day!  ",

He couldn’t remember the jump itself, only the jolt of the landing. It was like waking up. He went into the bathroom to urinate and splash cold water on his face. Then he opened the door to the living room, which looked familiar. There were a few people sitting around, but the only ones he recognized were Fleur and Rafael. Fleur, although aging (at last), still as tall and beautiful as ever, Rafael taller still, balding, bearded (today – the beard comes and goes), silent as usual.

Let’s go, the wife said, she pecked Smith on the forehead and they all marched out the door. The last one out, Rafael, stopped at the door and said Ciao to Smith, who was staring down at the floor. Ciao, he answered without looking up. He was offended that they hadn’t asked him to go along, but he also had a vague remembrance that he might have mentioned that he didn’t like opera, which wouldn’t have been true if he’d indeed said it.
