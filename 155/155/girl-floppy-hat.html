<main>
<p class="intro">My infrequent trips to the States, on family business or just
business, were almost always uneventful. But the last two had been the
most eventful journeys of my life. The first began with a four-hour bus
ride from my home in a remote corner of Argentina to the city of
Cordoba, where I entered a travel agency a few minutes after three in
the afternoon and approached Luciano’s desk. He stood up, smiled
automatically and held out his hand. As I took it his smile vanished as
quickly as it had appeared and he said, “You traveling today…or
tomorrow?” and I knew something was wrong.</p>
<p>“Today, of course.”</p>
<p>He looked at me, obviously puzzled, then shrugged. “Correct, no
problem. For some reason I thought it was tomorrow.” (The customer is
always right, even when he isn’t.)</p>
<p>Part of my work as a consultant to agricultural cooperatives is to
analyze misunderstandings. Do you know what the problem is? People don’t
listen. Luciano sat down and clicked away at his computer. I sat across
from him and glanced at the calendar on his desk: Friday, January 8. I
was about to say, Hey, Luciano, you should keep your calendar up to date
and you’d know when your clients were traveling, but instead I opened
the newspaper I’d bought at a kiosko outside the agency just before
entering and looked at the date: Friday, January 8. My face felt hot and
I was glad that Luciano was busy changing my reservation and couldn’t
notice my embarrassment. I had left home a day early. It made no
difference for what I had to do in Florida, except that I wanted to
leave on Saturday and arrive on Sunday morning in order to rest one day
and get busy on Monday. Now I’d have a Saturday on my hands. Still, it
was the first time something like that had happened to me. I might
misplace my glasses now and then, but a whole day!  </p>
<p>“Wait here just a minute, don Frank. I’m going to the airline to
change the ticket.”</p>
<p>I went to a café on the next block and ordered a cafecito while I
read the newspaper. It was mostly about the economic recession,
unemployment and the political party infighting in Argentina and,
naturally, the war in Kosovo. All depressing stuff, but more depressing,
for me, was the reason for my trip to Florida – to transfer my mother
from an Assisted Living Facility to a nursing home and get Medicaid to
pay for it. I walked back to the travel agency and found Luciano at his
desk listening to another passenger’s woes. He handed me my ticket in a
plastic envelope and I inspected it carefully.</p>
<p>“All in order, don Frank,” Luciano assured me. “You still have plenty
of time to get to the airport.”</p>
<p>“Did you reserve a car for me?”</p>
<p>“Yes, of course, Interamericano. Have a good trip.” He scuttled back
to his client and peered into his monitor. “Hey, Julieta,” he called to
the girl at the next work-station, “what’s the code for Santiago de
Chile?”</p>
<p>“How should I know? Look it up.”</p>
<p>“SCL,” I said, smugly I fear, as I picked up my bag and strolled
toward the door, and they all turned and looked at me.</p>
<p>The short flight to Buenos Aires was on time and uneventful. I passed
an hour of the three hour wait for the connecting flight re-reading
Carson McCuller’s “The Heart is a Lonely Hunter”. I had chosen it
because it’s small and light – not in content but in weight. I bought
some pipe tobacco in the tax-free shop and walked around the transit
lounge observing my fellow passengers boarding in Buenos Aires as they
drifted in. The usual mix of nervous tourists already dressed for Disney
World and business people looking like their next important meeting
would be immediately after take-off.I saw the girl in the floppy hat
shortly before the flight was called. Tall and very thin. Young, too
young for the likes of me, unless you take Sean Connery movies
seriously. Her hat covered the upper right side of her face. She wore an
ankle-length blue skirt slit up to the back of her knees and a wrinkled
cream linen jacket and heelless sandals. Bare feet aren’t very sensible
for air travel. I had to smile when I realized that I was worried about
that. You often see underdressed tourists who think that because their
destination is warm it will also be warm at thirty-thousand feet and
arrive sneezing. But why should I be worried? Maybe because she looked
so fragile. The idea of approaching her and suggesting that she put on
socks was ridiculous. I’d long since learned that unasked for advice is
almost always unwelcome. Besides, where would she get them? I couldn’t
very well offer mine. The flight was called forty minutes before
departure time, the usual procedure for getting hundreds of passengers
into a 747 and still depart on time. </p>
<p>I put the book into my carry-on and stood up as the they called for
passengers holding seats in rows 32 through 43 to board. The girl, who
had been standing the whole time, suddenly sat down and pulled a pair of
gray woolen socks from her overnight bag. She took off the sandals and
slipped on the socks. I smiled and nodded in her direction: Atta
girl.</p>
<p>I had an aisle seat so I wouldn’t have to climb over people to go to
the john or roam the aisles. A window is preferable if there’s anything
to see, but we were leaving at eleven at night and arriving at 6.30 in
the morning. When I got to row 33, there she was in the window seat. I
don’t believe in coincidences, which doesn’t mean that every time you
sit next to someone on a bus or airplane it’s part of your karma, but
this time I had already been watching her in the terminal and worrying
about her feet being cold. I mean what are the odds?     </p>
<p>I said <em>Hola</em> as I placed my carry-on under the seat. She
smiled and nodded as she took off the hat, rolled it up and stuffed it
into the seat-pocket in front of her. Jet black silky hair blended
nicely with her green eyes. She turned and gazed out the window at the
runway lights, which soon became starlights and I opened <em>The Heart
is a Lonely Hunter</em> and read the same paragraph three times before
giving it up.</p>
<p><em>“Pollo o pasta?”</em> the flight attendant mumbled with a lack of
enthusiasm fully shared by the passengers. My ears were still stopped up
so I didn’t hear the first word and said “Pasta o <em>qué</em>?”
“Pollo,” she repeated. “Pasta,” I said with a shrug in my voice. My
companion ordered the pollo and said to me, “It’s chicken.” I realized
she thought I hadn’t understood, being too obviously a gringo, so I said
to her in Spanish, “Ah, you wanted to help me, but my ears were only
stopped up.” She blushed and nodded. I ordered red wine and water and
she water only. We ate in silence until I decided it was time to put a
deeper crack in the ice.</p>
<p>“This pasta has no taste at all,” I said. “How’s the chicken?”</p>
<p>“It tastes like pasta.”  </p>
<p>We laughed. “But the wine doesn’t taste like water,” I said. “Like a
drop?”</p>
<p>She held out her plastic cup. “Well, just a drop.” I leaned across
the empty seat and poured her several.</p>
<p>“Are you from Buenos Aires?” I asked her.</p>
<p>“No, Santiago de Chile. Do you know it?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I’ve been there often. Chilean women are the most beautiful in
the world, or so I’ve been told.”</p>
<p>“You’ve been told,” she said with a wide-open smile. “And have you no
opinion?”</p>
<p>“Oh yes, I agree entirely.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, in the name of Chilean women… and you’re American.”</p>
<p>“Is it so obvious?”</p>
<p>         “I saw your passport,” she admitted as she went at cutting
the chicken with a plastic knife,” when you were in the tax-free
shop.”</p>
<p>That was even before I noticed her. So she’s interested. Fancy
that.</p>
<p>“Do you live in Florida?” she asked me.</p>
<p>“No, in Córdoba, not so far from Chile really. Do you know it?”</p>
<p>“Only from the air. It’s on the Pampas, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Part of it is, but I live in the mountainous part.</p>
<p>“Oh, that must be nice…”</p>
<p>And so it went until they announced that the movie would be
<em>You’ve got Mail</em>. “Do you have Internet?” I asked her.</p>
<p>She nodded. “I hear the movie is good, but I can barely keep my eyes
open.”</p>
<p>I leaned between my legs and fished in my overnight bag for a
notebook and pen. “Let me take down your e-mail address and I’ll give
you mine.” I moved into the middle seat, wrote my address on a page of
the notebook, ripped it out and handed it to her, together with the
notebook. “If we miss the movie, which seems likely, whoever sees it
first can tell the other about it.” Admittedly a weak excuse for moving
closer to her and finding out her name. She read my name and e-mail
address, hesitated a moment, then wrote her name and e-mail address in
the notebook.</p>
<p>“You know, Mireya,” I said, feeling pressed for time because her
eyelids were already fluttering from the effort to stay open, “I might
have the weekend free and go to the beach. Maybe you’d like to come with
me.”</p>
<p>She looked into my eyes as though asking who I was and what she
should answer. I should have been surprised but wasn’t when she said
she’d like that. “I’m staying with friends in Ft. Lauderdale,” she said
so softly that I had to lean over to hear. She wrote a telephone number
in the notebook. “Perhaps you can call me when you know.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I will.”</p>
<p>“What beach do you go to?” she asked. “I hope not Ft. Lauderdale or
West Palm. I don’t like them.”</p>
<p>I laughed. “Good, I don’t either. I prefer Singer Island. Do you know
it?”</p>
<p>“I’ve heard of it, but have never been there.”</p>
<p>“It’s north of West Palm, and considerably cheaper.”</p>
<p>She nodded and yawned as the movie flickered to life. We watched
without sound for a while. Then, slowly, her head sank onto my shoulder
and I could smell her faint perfume. I closed my eyes and slept.</p>
<p>The flight is only seven and a half hours, so what with reaching
cruising altitude, eating and the bumps and grinds of the plane, it’s
impossible to get more than a few hours sleep. In my case even less, as
I was careful not to disturb her head on my shoulder (remember the
song?). In the morning she looked wan and seemed even thinner as we
walked together through the finger gate and separated at the immigration
desks. I promised to call her on Friday afternoon and kissed her on the
right cheek. Her green eyes seemed very large in that pale face as I
turned away and breezed through the US citizens line while she waited
with the lesser mortals.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It was a hectic week, which didn’t give me much time to face what I
was doing until the last moment when I said goodbye to my mother –
perhaps for the last time. She sat in a chair in the room she was to
share with another nursing home resident. “Do you have to go already?”
she asked. I didn’t really, but I was exhausted from running from the
Medicaid office to banks, my mother’s Assisted Living Facility, real
estate agents and nursing homes. And the fresh sea smell and the memory
of Mireya’s faint perfume were luring me away from the rancid odor of
age and urine. I walked quickly, almost ran, through the wheelchair
traffic to the elevator, waited impatiently for its slow-motion doors to
close and, once on street level, burst into the sunshine and across the
parking lot. I flipped on the Honda’s air conditioning to full and
pulled away. I phoned Mireya from my motel and offered to pick her up in
Ft. Lauderdale the next morning, Saturday, but she insisted on meeting
me halfway, said a friend would drive her. So I told her to go to
Federal Highway and Glades Road in Boca Raton at nine o’clock, or
earlier if she wanted. She said nine was fine. The rhyme woke me up to
the fact that we were speaking English. She had about the same amount of
accent in English as I have in Spanish. I had a quick supper in a
Denny’s, watched TV a while and went to bed early.</p>
<p>It was one of those beautiful sunny Florida mornings. I arrived at
the corner in Boca Raton five minutes ahead of time and she was already
there, standing alone dressed again in a long skirt, but of a lighter
color and fabric than the one she wore on the plane. A plain blue polo
shirt revealed that she was pretty flat-chested. And the same floppy
hat. I had expected to see long tanned legs in shorts, which was what
everyone else was wearing, including me. An overnight bag was at her
feet though, which was definitely a good sign. My heart raced and I told
it to slow down, that this was probably no more than a one-night stand
with a kid half my age and I should know better.</p>
<p>I pulled up to the curb and leaned over to open the door. She got in,
took off the hat and smiled her wide-open smile. Her teeth were large
and white and her mouth sensuous – to me at least – and somehow innocent
at the same time.</p>
<p>“Hi,” she said in English.</p>
<p>“Hi, were you waiting long?”</p>
<p>“No, about five minutes. I was early, I think.”</p>
<p>“Yes, so was I.”</p>
<p>She leaned over and kissed me on the cheek. I swear it burned.
“That’s for being early,” she said, and looked front with her hands in
her lap, smiling softly.</p>
<p>“It’s true then,” I said.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“That it pays to be punctual.”</p>
<p> We got onto <em>I 95</em> heading North. I was busy maneuvering us
through the weekend traffic to our destination in one piece so we didn’t
say much. The radio was tuned to NPR, where they were on a Gershwin
kick. Mireya moved her lips to the songs and hummed a little. She had a
sweet voice. She asked me to put the air conditioning down although it
was already low. I don’t care for it myself, but in Florida it’s
necessary. I turned onto Blue Heron Drive, crossed the bridge to Singer
Island and pulled into a Days Inn I know there. Once in our large
Florida-sized room, I asked her if she’d like to go for a swim before it
got too hot.</p>
<p>“You go,” she said. “I’d like to just rest a little.” Rest? It was
only ten o’clock. I hadn’t seen the ocean in months and wanted to now.
Should I just change in front of her, or do it in the bathroom? She
solved the problem by going in herself.</p>
<p>The water was pellucid and warm. I dove in, swam a few strokes and
floated with my face in the sun. There’s something strange about her, I
thought. First of all, no young woman in her right mind would go off for
the weekend these days with a total stranger who could turn into Juan
the Ripper at the first glimpse of moonlight …and the clothes…long skirt
while travelling when everyone else her age wears jeans or slacks, and
the same kind of skirt in shorts-crazy Florida…and the floppy hat.</p>
<p>I rode in on a minuscule wave and walked back over the hot sand to
the hotel. The wave of anticipation I felt wasn’t entirely sexual; it
was more like the confusion of emotions usually associated with an
adolescent’s first love. I shook my head to myself in wonder. I had
brought a key with me – a key-card rather – from habit, so I let myself
into the room, which was in a motel-like location on the ground floor.
The air conditioning had been turned off and only the blower was on,
sucking filtered hot air into the room. She was lying on the bed naked
with her legs spread and her eyes closed. Was I surprised, despite
everything? You bet. She was even thinner than I had imagined, with
nipples like brown buttons perched on petite breasts. Almost a boy’s
body; the muted feminine curves were there though. I closed and locked
the door and crossed to the bathroom to shower trying, unsuccessfully,
not to think while I did so. How old would she be? 25? Well, let’s give
her 27 in order not to be less than half as old as me. What kind of
performance was she expecting from a weary stud in the autumn of his
discontent? I wiped off the steam and looked at myself in the mirror.
Well, no time like the present to find out.</p>
<p>I lay down beside her on the bed half expecting her to twist around
and lock me in a passionate embrace, or at least turn her head and
smile, waiting for me to initiate the overtures. But she didn’t move and
I realized from her breathing that she was fast asleep. What the hell do
I do now? One of my greatest shortcomings is that when I don’t know what
to do I usually do nothing. In this case, however, it turned out to be
right. I closed my eyes and fell asleep, which was easy after the sea
swim and the sun.  </p>
<p>I woke with dark curtains of hair draped on both sides of my face and
clear green eyes looking into mine. “How beautifully you sleep,” she
whispered. She moved on top of me and I barely felt her weight. “You
will be gentle, won’t you?” she asked. “I know you are a gentle person.”
I nodded as well as one can with his head on a pillow. Somehow words
wouldn’t come, not even “yes”. I lifted my arms to embrace her.</p>
<p>“Please,” she said, urgently it seemed, “don’t touch my back.”</p>
<p>Why not? What would happen if I touched her back? It reminded me of
the Chinese princess who always wore a ribbon around her neck. When the
prince secretly removed it while she was sleeping her head fell off. I
let my arms falls outward like a man on a cross. She started to reach
for my penis.</p>
<p>“Mireya, er, don’t you think we should use some kind of
protection?”</p>
<p>It took a moment for her to understand what I meant, long enough for
my erection to sink and, I thought in mild panic, perhaps never to rise
again.</p>
<p>“Oh, I don’t want that, do you…really?”</p>
<p>“Well…”</p>
<p>“Are you afraid of AIDS?”</p>
<p>I’m deathly afraid of AIDS, yes. “No, but..well..nowadays…” I felt
worse than a coward, I felt like a traitor, an enemy of love.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to worry,” she said, smiling artlessly. “I haven’t
been with a man since my first boyfriend, and that was ten years ago.”
She put her face next to mine, relaxing. “The incubation period is less
than that, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” I said, “but what about me? I mean you don’t know me very
well.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know you at all,” she murmured in my ear. “Yet I know you
perfectly, and for such a long time. I’m not afraid, really”       </p>
<p>I didn’t know what to say to that, so I just lay there in crucified
mode.</p>
<p>“There is one thing though,” Mireya said, lifting her head to look at
me. “I cannot get pregnant.”</p>
<p>“Of course not.”</p>
<p>“So…so maybe you’re right. I mean that would be…” she searched for a
word… “unfair.”</p>
<p>Unfair to whom? I thought, but said, “Don’t worry.” I was thinking
that I’d pull out before ejaculation.</p>
<p>“Could you…could you not come?” she asked. That was quite different,
but I confidently agreed. And, wondrously, my erection agreed as well. I
was gentle, very gentle, moving slowly or not at all. She arched over
me, reached for the ceiling and moaned, then fell down and the black
curtains covered my face. Soon she rose again, reached this time for the
stars and seemed to attain them for her moan was more like a soft
scream. I knew I couldn’t hold out much longer, so I eased her off and
we lay pressed together for a long time. She slept for a few minutes and
I felt pleasure at having given her such pleasure.</p>
<p>It was dark out when we got out of the bed. Neither of us had eaten
anything since breakfast, and I didn’t know if she had even had that.
When we were washed and dressed we went to the hotel’s restaurant,
ordered swordfish and white wine and I prepared myself to ask her some
questions, but it wasn’t necessary. She started talking.</p>
<p>“Did you wonder why I didn’t want you to touch my back, Frank?”</p>
<p>“As a matter of fact I did. I thought maybe it was some kind of
reverse fetish.”</p>
<p>She didn’t laugh. “You see, I had an operation and there are some
ugly scars on my back.” Tears formed in her eyes, but she blinked
several times rapidly and they were gone. Or maybe it was my
imagination.</p>
<p>“What kind of operation?”</p>
<p>“I had lung cancer — or I still have it, I don’t know.”</p>
<p>That explained a lot, but I wasn’t sure how. I took a healthy gulp of
wine. “Tell me about it, Mireya.”</p>
<p>“You can see them,” she said quickly. “It’s just that I didn’t want
you to today. Can you understand that — or is it too silly?”</p>
<p>“Yes, of course. Today’s special.”</p>
<p>She took my hand. “Yes, it is. Very special.”</p>
<p>“It’s all right, I don’t need to see them,” I said, and I honestly
had no desire to.</p>
<p>She pushed back her hair. “I’ve had it for twelve years, not on the
lungs, that started two years ago. It began on my leg. They cut it out
and I took anthroposophical medicine. Do you know what that is?” I shook
my head. “It’s something like homeopathy, but better. I’m sure it’s what
has kept me alive so long.”</p>
<p>“And is it cured now?” I asked. I wanted it to be cured.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. That’s why I came here. There’s a wonderful surgeon
here, a friend of my family’s who operated on me the last time. I don’t
mean the leg,” she added quickly, “I also had a lung operation.” Then,
barely pausing, she said, “I’ve really been very lucky. You have no idea
how kind people have been to me.” I wouldn’t call having lung cancer
exactly lucky, but I didn’t say so.</p>
<p>“And other friends paid for my trip. You see, a few months ago they
discovered – that was in Chile, where I have a wonderful doctor but he’s
not a surgeon – he discovered small nodules in each lung, just one in
each.”</p>
<p>“I see,” I said. “And the last time, I mean the operation?”</p>
<p>“That was much worse. He took out almost half of both lungs.” She
frowned. “But sometimes even small things are serious.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“They haven’t grown, but the doctor wanted to examine me anyway and
take new x-rays and other tests.”</p>
<p>“So that’s what you were doing during the week?”</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s what I was doing. And do you know what he said?”
Suddenly she was like a happy child. “He said he didn’t see the need for
another operation, that they looked insignificant and if they don’t grow
I should be all right.”</p>
<p>I squeezed her hand and blinked myself this time. “That’s wonderful,
Mireya.”</p>
<p>“Now do you see how lucky I am? Then I met you, which was the
greatest luck of all.” Our table was lit only by candlelight, so she
didn’t see me blush, but I must have looked puzzled and embarrassed, for
she said, “Don’t you know why?”</p>
<p>I shook my head, it’s all I could do.</p>
<p>“Because I love you..and you love me, I can feel it. Isn’t it
so?”</p>
<p>And then I cried, I actually cried real tears, silently, with my head
down. It was the first time I had cried in many years. I’m not the
emotional type. “Yes, Mireya, it’s true that I love you, but I’m the
lucky one for that, not you.”</p>
<p>“Then we’ll both be lucky,” she said, smiling, and lifted my hand to
her lips. “But you see now why I always wear these long skirts and that
silly hat.”</p>
<p>“I do?”</p>
<p>“I would love to wear shorts as they all do here and run along the
sand and dive naked into the sea…but I can’t. I have to keep out of the
sun and almost any strenuous activity tires me. I’m sorry, darling, it
must be such a bore for you.”</p>
<p>“Not at all,” I assured her, “I can show off my muscles better this
way. You just sit and watch.”</p>
<p>“I have and you have beautiful muscles.”</p>
<p>“Ah-ha, at last I’ve caught you in a lie.”</p>
<p>“It’s not a lie, it’s true,” she giggled. “They’re just not very
big.”</p>
<p>“But beautiful.”</p>
<p>“Exactly.” She giggled again. “I’m not supposed to drink wine,
either.” She sipped and looked over her glass at me like a wanton
sinner. “And if I got pregnant I just don’t know what I would do.”</p>
<p>“Of course, I understand.”</p>
<p>“You know, if I wasn’t…ill…I’d never have come with you here.” Her
eyes glowed blue-green in the candlelight. “Time is against me though.
Something has happened inside me that I can’t contain, that I don’t want
to contain. Because I don’t think I’ll have the opportunity to feel
something like this again.”</p>
<p>She did tire easily. I had to almost carry her to our room, even help
her undress. She was out like a light as soon as her head touched the
pillow. I went down to the sea and looked at the stars a long time
before joining her. The next morning she stayed in bed. She said she was
fine, just wanted to rest luxuriously, that she was spoiled. In the
afternoon we went to the beach and she sat in a rented beach-chair with
an umbrella over it and watched me swim from under the rim of her floppy
hat. During the drive back to Ft. Lauderdale we didn’t say much. Her
head was on my shoulder and we were just there, together.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>From then on we communicated by e-mail. I have saved her side of the
correspondence because it’s so eloquent and moving. My side was…well…me.
I went to Santiago a few times on business and stayed the weekends with
Mireya. The last time she was in bed which what she called an attack of
weakness. She had a small house in her parent’s garden – a living room
that doubled as bedroom, a kitchenette and bathroom, everything in
miniature. I slept on the floor beside her narrow bed, a far cry from
the room at the Hilton Carrera that my client was paying for, but
infinitely more satisfying. She said she was going to her sister’s place
in the south of Chile for a few months and asked me to visit her there
the week after Easter when her sister, Mónica, would be going to
Santiago. But Mónica didn’t want to leave her alone, so that would be
our excuse for my being there. She described the mountainous area in
glowing terms, adding that one day she wanted to live there forever. I
said yes, of course I would go, that I couldn’t wait. “Oh, that will be
wonderful!” she cried and hugged me so hard that she began to cough and
had to lay back again.</p>
<p>It was during that visit that she played a recording. A sweet voice
singing <em>lieder</em>. “How do you like it?” she asked me with a
mischievous smile. “She’s very good,” I said, and meant it. “She’s not
German though, is she?”</p>
<p>Mireya laughed. “No, I only memorized the words.” My surprise was
evident. “Yes, I studied singing at the conservatory and the teachers
thought I had a brilliant career ahead of me. Naturally I can no longer
sing.” Her eyes were saying, Don’t worry, I’m happy anyway.</p>
<p>Mireya had no access to Internet in the south of Chile, but I phoned
her frequently. On the Monday after Easter Sunday, as I was about to
leave for the airport, the “Wellness Director” at my mother’s nursing
home called from Florida to inform me that my mother had died in her
sleep. It wasn’t unexpected, in fact in a way I was glad because Mom had
certainly had enough of being a child in an old woman’s incontinent
body. The conflict with my coming visit to Mireya was foremost in my
mind. I hesitated, then said I would be in the nursing home early on…no,
the following day was impossible…the day after, the third day after her
death. I had just called Luciano to change my booking from Santiago to
Miami and was about to call Mireya to tell her I’d be delayed when, on
impulse, I decided to check my e-mail. There was one message waiting to
be read. It was in Spanish from Santiago de Chile.</p>
      <blockquote style="font-style:italic">
<p>Estimado Frank,<br/>
Mireya died today, Easter Sunday. She had a brain tumor that grew
very fast and wasn’t diagnosed. She was thirty years old. She will be
cremated today in Santiago.</br>
With deep regret,<br/>
Mónica </p>

<p>I had selected an aisle seat as usual, but the flight was lightly
booked so when I reached my row I sat in the middle seat, an old trick
to avoid anyone sitting next to me, and closed my eyes. I had just lost
the two people I loved most in the world and didn’t want some boozy shoe
salesman feeling sociable sitting next to me. As we were rolling toward
the runway, I felt someone climb over my knees and into the window seat.
I sighed and was about to move to the aisle seat when someone sat in it
as well. So much for solitude. The aircraft shuddered as it strove for
altitude and I glanced to my left. Mireya, with the floppy hat still on,
smiled softly and rested her head on my shoulder and I could smell her
faint perfume. My skin tightened and my head felt as though it were
burning. My first thought was that the telegram had been a mistake or a
sadistic joke. I knew that wasn’t true, but it was all I could imagine.
I tried to say something to her, I forget what, probably just her name,
but my lips and throat were parched and nothing came out. So I just sat
there, more or less in suspended animation, when the person on my right
put her hand – an old, liver-spotted hand – on mine and patted it three
times, then folded her hands in her lap and looked forward. My mother
had never liked flying and preferred to be as far from the window as
possible.</p>
<p>I closed my eyes again and thought how fortunate I was to be
accompanied by the two women whose love I was entirely unworthy of, at
least for the next seven and a half hours.</p>
