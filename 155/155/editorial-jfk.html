<h1>JFK's Lost Suitcase</h1>

<p class="intro">
It was 1960. I worked as an American Airlines ticket and ramp
agent at New York's LaGuardia Airport. It was a time of DC 3s
and 6s, Convairs and later the Lockheed Electra turboprops -
which began to fall out of the sky at around that time because
of torque pressure on the wings.
</p><p>
We did everything. Nowadays you buy your ticket on the internet
or from a travel agent. Then you were more likely to have bought
it from us at the airport. That means that we didn't only give
you a boarding pass and sling your bag onto a belt, but we also
issued your ticket by hand, which made us tariff experts as
well. And fares were complicated those days – there were “open
jaw” constructions, which meant that you could travel from A to
B but return from C to A (the open jaw being from B to C) and
still get the round-trip discount, by calculating one-half the
round trip fares A-B and C-A. There were also “triangular” fares
– A to B to C to A, for example: New York-Paris-Buenos Aires-New
York.
</p><p>
And just think: no computers. Can you imagine life without
computers? Maybe it wasn't as efficient, but it was certainly
more people-oriented. We had hundreds of so-called reservation
agents, mostly female, in the NY city office; country-wide
thousands. When the computers arrived, they went. “Unemployment
is here to stay.” Truer words were never spoken.
</p><p>
LaGuardia Airport was basically an extended quonset hut and the
airplanes came right up to our backs at the ticket counter
making an infernal racket, especially the turboprops. Just as
there were no seatbelts in cars, and everyone smoked, there was
no ear protection gear and now we all suffer from greater or
lesser degrees of deafness.
</p><p>
But I want to tell you about one of our frequent fliers
(although the term didn't yet exist). His initials were JFK, but
no one called him that yet. To fly from Boston to Washington,
you had to connect in New York, so we saw Senator Kennedy often.
American Airlines had a primitive VIP lounge where a so-called
Passenger Service Manager reigned, when he wasn't calming
passengers bumped from oversold flights. When JFK was around he
was always offered the lounge, but he preferred to mix with the
crowd, smiling and shaking hands – until he became a serious
presidential candidate and the secret service goon-wall closed
him in – but not enough as it turned out.
</p><p>
It' s hard now to grasp how a politician could be so popular,
and became more and more loved as time went on, except of course
by the Cuban exile community in Florida, the mafia and the
military-industrial complex. When he was assassinated though, it
became evident. The U.S. consulate in Buenos Aires had a line a
block long for a week of people waiting to sign the condolence
book. And there were similar scenes around the world.
</p><p>
One day in November a snow storm suddenly struck New York City
and a large part of the Eastern seaboard. It was my day off, but
they phoned me to come in and help with the “normal” airport
chaos when bad weather hit. I sort of liked working in the
chaos, especially at double pay. I started at six in the
afternoon and by 9 p.m. the airport was shut down for incoming
and outgoing flights – which left a lot of wannabe passengers in
the airport with no place to go. If they were initiating their
journeys in New York, they could go home. The problem was with
those who were returning home or connecting to some other
destination. We had to rebook them (on already fully booked
flights – guess how), find space in already full hotels (finally
impossible, so they slept in the airport), try to calm the irate
ones, who seemed to think that bad weather was the airlines'
fault.
</p><p>
The Station Manager asked me to stay another six hours and
relieve the Lost and Found agent, who was on the verge of a
nervous breakdown. Bad weather also tends to separate passengers
from their luggage. To use the Washington (A) New York (B)
Boston (C) example again, the pax who starts in Washington on
his/her way to Boston makes it to New York on a delayed flight,
sprints to the gate to make the departing flight to Boston and
makes it, but his bag does not; it joins the many other bags in
the Lost and Found area from that and many other flights which
missed their connections. So the poor schmucks arrive in Boston
and wait for their bags until they realize that they're not
coming, so they go to the Lost and Found agent, who fills out a
form with the bag's description and, most importantly, the tag
number. Those days the baggage tags were attached to the handle
by a rubber band – I kid you not – and they often came off. The
L & F agent gets rid of the passengers, telling them to go home
or to their hotel and the bag will be retrieved and delivered to
them asap. Which was true, if it was ever found. Then the agent
sent messages by telex – if you don't know what a telex
is...was...I don't have time to explain. There was no internet,
no email, so telex was what we considered super-fast
communication – to the L &F agents in other airports trying to
trace the lost bags. A good L&F agent had to have not only
knowledge, but also intuition.
</p><p>
The young woman I relieved, Peggy, had a supernatural radar. We
once pondered over a VIP's bag which had somehow disappeared
between Chicago and New York. Actually he was a VIP because he
told me I better find his bag “quick” or else, with an Italian
accent. “Try Rome,” Peggy said. “Rome?” I objected. “We don't
even fly there.” (American Airlines was still a domestic carrier
then.) “Yeah, but let's try anyway; I got a hunch.” Knowing that
Peggy's hunches were as solid as Swiss francs, I sent a telex to
Pan Am L&F in Rome with all the information I had. The next
morning they replied that they had the bag, but didn't
understand how it got there, because the tag read “LGA”
(LaGuardia). They sent it to Pan Am at Idlewild airport (now
JFK) and we had it delivered to the passenger's hotel – the
Waldorf Astoria. A few months later he was found dead floating
in the East River. Apparently they didn't want to waste cement.
</p><p>
Anyway, there I was alone in the L&F office with piles of
orphaned bags in the baggage area next to the office. I don't
remember the exact time I received the call from the AA general
manager in Boston. He was nervous. “Senator John Kennedy's bag
is lost,” he shouted in his Massachusetts twang, later made
famous by JFK himself. “Didn't you get our telex?” “Actually,
no,” I said “not yet.” A pile of unread telexes covered my desk
sent from L&F agents around the system tracing lost bags. It
always happened during storms. I was shuffling through them,
when the one from BOS caught my eye because of the word URGENT!
repeated a dozen times. “Oh, here it is,” I said. “What?” he
screamed, “The bag?” “No, the telex.” “Well now that you have
the description, find the fucking bag, idiot!”
</p><p>
I held the phone away from my ear and looked at it as the blood
rose to my eyes. Then I spoke to the mouthpiece without placing
the earpiece against my ear: “I'm hanging up now, Mr.\_\_\_\_\_,
if and when you are able to talk with civility calm down and try
again.” Bam.
</p><p>
I went out to the orphaned bags area with the telex in hand and
soon found the large aluminum suitcase with Kennedy's nametag on
it. The phone was ringing again as I dragged it into the office.
“This is Ted \_\_\_\_\_ from Boston? What did you say your name
was?” I told him. “Okay, Mr Smith, sorry about that outburst.
It's just that this is so important.” I couldn't see what was so
important about one lost bag among so many, except that the
owner was a VIP. “You see, Senator Kennedy is going to New
Hampshire tomorrow morning, and you are aware of how important
New Hampshire is in presidential elections?”
</p><p>
“Yes, I know,” I said. “Symbolic.”
</p><p>
“That's right – and not only the senator's toothbrush is in that
bag, but also his speech, which will be heard by the whole
country. So you can understand how important it is that we get
that bag to him asap.”
</p><p>
“I can see that, Mr\_\_\_\_\_, and I really like Kennedy, but
we're closed.”
</p><p>
“Oh my God! It stopped snowing here hours ago.”
</p><p>
“Here too,” I confirmed, “but the airport closed for landings
before it closed for take-offs, so we have no planes left.”
</p><p>
“What about 621?” he asked desperately. 621 was our late night
milk-run to Boston.
</p><p>
“Canceled. The early morning flights will be canceled too.
Always happens, no airplanes.”
</p><p>
“Shit.”
</p><p>
Yeah, I thought, this guy probably promised Kennedy he'd move
heaven and earth – mostly heaven – to get his bag to him.
</p><p>
“There's always the train though,” I said. I knew there as a
midnight milkrun from Grand Central up to New England because in
the past when there were no flights to Boston and Hartford, we'd
sent passengers there – usually ones who had no money for a
hotel. But this wasn't a passenger, only his bag.
</p><p>
“The train? Of course. Can you do that, Mr. Smith, get the bag
on that train?”
</p><p>
“Call me Frank. I don't know,” I admitted. “First I gotta find
out if the train is running. I'll call you back.”
</p><p>
“No, I'll hold.”
</p><p>
I hung up. Then I found Grand Central's number on our list and
called. As expected, everyone at the other end was in a bad
mood, but Kennedy's name worked wonders – as it had with me, now
that I think of it. Finally I was talking to the dispatcher and
explaining the situation to him..
</p><p>
“If you can get that bag here on time, it'll go,” he said.
“Bring it to me, O'Neill, in the dispatcher's office.”
</p><p>
I looked at my watch. It was 11:15. “How much will it cost?” I
asked.
</p><p>
“No time for that. I'll give it to the conductor. Colored guy,
loves Kennedy too.”
</p><p>
The problem now was how to get the suitcase to Grand Central
Station. I couldn't go, I was alone with the phone ringing off
the hook and hundreds of lost bags to reunite with their owners.
I decided to try the baggage handlers, although without much
hope. You see, American Airlines had terrible relations with
unionized employees. The president, C.R. Smith, hated unions.
And the unions and its members hated him. The workers did their
job, but with the absolute minimum of effort and according to
the union contract. The union, by the way, was the Teamsters.
They tried to recruit us as well, but we (white collar types)
wanted no part of it. Luckily, every time our blue collar
colleagues got raises through contract negotiations, we got more
without a peep.
</p><p>
They had work shifts on duty even when there was nothing to do,
and there were bound to be several guys playing cards now. I had
pretty good relations with them because I didn't try to boss
them around. They only took orders from their own bosses. I bent
down and crawled on the belt through the baggage entrance. The
Lead Agent and three others were drinking coffee and playing
cards. The airline didn't see fit to give them uniforms, so they
looked like a bunch of guys hanging out in a bar.
</p><p>
“Hiya, Smitty,” the Lead said. “No bags here; we dumped them all
in the area.”
</p><p>
“Just wanna hide a while, Cassidy,” I said. “The telephone,
telexes and people are all driving me crazy.”
</p><p>
“Gimme three,” one of them said, and threw down three cards.
There were only coins in the pot, but coins were worth a lot
more then.
</p><p>
“And now I get this call from the manager in Boston...” I told
them about it. When I got to Kennedy, the youngest one, trying
to sound tough, said, “Who da fuck is dat?”
</p><p>
“John F. Kennedy, you ignorant Polack prick,” Cassidy said. “The
next president of the united States.”
</p><p>
“A course, I know dat,” the kid said. “Just sayin, dats all.”
</p><p>
“Send it by taxi,” Cassidy said.
</p><p>
“Yeah, but with who? I can't go, and I can't just hand it over
to some taxi driver.”Lead Agent Cassidy, about 40 years old,
looked at the three working class young men seated around him.
“Anyone interested in going to Grand Central with the Senator
Kennedy's suitcase? With his fuckin speech in it, which can help
him become the president of the United States of America?”
</p><p>
“I'll go,” a skinny kid with big ears said, and jumped up.
</p><p>
“It's voluntary,” Cassidy said.
</p><p>
“I said I'll go, boss.”
</p><p>
“What's your name?” I asked the kid (actually we were the same
age) after he had picked up the suitcase and we were heading for
the terminal exit.
</p><p>
“Johnson,” he answered. “ Charlie Johnson. We don't get
nametags."
</p><p>
There was one taxi at the entrance. The driver's head was under
the hood. He backed out and closed the hood. “Goin to Grand
Central Station,” I told him.
</p><p>
“Not with me, you ain't.” He was a black guy, very big. “I'm
gone home, man.”
</p><p>
I repeated the Kennedy story again.
</p><p>
“Why didn't ya say so, lord sakes. Gimme dat bag.” He put it in
the passenger seat alongside him and Charlie Johnson got in the
back after I gave him ten bucks – the airline's money of course
– for the round trip taxi fare. I looked at my watch: it was
11:45. I ran back to the L&F office where the phone was ringing.
I lifted and hung it up, then dialed the dispatcher at Grand
Central and told him the suitcase was on its way but wouldn't
make it by midnight, maybe a few minutes later. He told me
they'd hold the train, just to make sure that young guy Jack
Kennedy gets to be president. He laughed and said thank you...to
me!
</p><p>
I hung up and the phone rang again immediately. It was the
Boston asshole of course. I told him to meet the train tomorrow
morning and get the bag from the conductor. “And give Senator
Kennedy my regards,” I said.
</p><p>
“You know him?” he said, astonished.
</p><p>
“Sure.” Actually, I did, in a way. Once when I was acting
Passenger Service Manager because the real one was sick, I held
a flight to Boston so Kennedy could catch it at the last minute.
He'd thanked me profusely, which he didn't need to do. A couple
of weeks later when I was back on the ticket counter, PSM badge
gone, he remembered me and asked if I'd been demoted and I
explained that I'd only been acting PSM that day. He said he
hoped I'd get to be a real one soon.
</p><p>
Sometimes I think there must be some kind of evil entity charged
with getting rid of the special people who appear on this
earthly scene now and then and who are destined to do really
good, important things. They get streets and plazas, schools and
museums, even airports named after them, but their ability for
accomplishment is cut short. You know who I mean. People like
Jack Kennedy, his brother Bobby, who I also knew, sort of, from
the airport, Martin Luther king, Gandhi – and others I guess who
never become famous. I don't mean that as a conspiracy theory,
no, not that. But sometimes we just have to ask ourselves why.
