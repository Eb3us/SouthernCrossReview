<h4>Translated by D. S. Osmond and Charles Davy January 25, 2010 - GA

<p class="intro">When someone has concerned himself for a time with the conception of
the world presented by Spiritual Science, and then allows the various
ideas and thoughts and items of knowledge that he gains from it to work
upon him, manifold questions arise, and he becomes more and more of a
spiritual scientist by linking such questions — which are really
questions of feeling, of the heart, of the character, in short, of life
in general — with spiritual-scientific ideas. The nature of these ideas
is such that they do not only satisfy our theoretical, scientific
curiosity but shed light upon the riddles of life, upon the mysteries of
existence, and they bear fruit in the real sense only when we no longer
merely reflect about and feel their import, value and meaning, but learn
under their influence to look differently at the world around us. These
ideas should warm us inwardly, should become impulses, forces of heart
and soul within us. And this is increasingly so when the answers
received to certain questions give rise to new questions, when those
answers in turn become questions followed by new answers, and so on. In
this way progress is made both in spiritual knowledge and in the
spiritual life.</p>
<p>A fairly long time will still have to pass before it will be possible
to speak of the more intimate aspects of spiritual life in public
lectures, but within our own Groups the time when this can be done
should be coming nearer and nearer. It is therefore inevitable that new
members may be taken aback or even shocked when they hear certain
things; but, after all, we should make no progress in our work if we
could not pass on to discuss more intimate questions of life on the
basis of spiritual-scientific investigation and knowledge. Therefore —
although misunderstandings may arise in those of you who have been
concerned with the spiritual life for only a comparatively short time —
we will consider certain of these more intimate facts of spiritual
knowledge again today.</p>
<p>Without doubt an earnest question will arise in us when we think
about the idea of <em>reincarnation</em>, of many earth-lives, not
merely as an abstract theory, but when we ponder deeply on the meaning
and implications of this fact of the spiritual life. The significant
answer given by reincarnation will be followed by new questions and we
may ask, for example: If the human being lives many times on earth, if
he returns again and again in new incarnations, what is the deeper
meaning of this? — The usual answer is that by passing many times
through life we ascend higher and higher, experiencing the results and
fruits of earlier earth-lives in later ones, and thus making progress.
But that is still a rather general, abstract answer. It is only through
more exact knowledge of the whole purpose of earthly life that we are
able to fathom the significance of repeated incarnations.</p>
<p>If a person were to keep returning to an earth that did not change
but remained essentially the same, there would not really be much to be
learnt through successive incarnations. These incarnations are important
because, as we pass through each of them, we can learn new things, have
new experiences on the earth. Over short periods of time this is not so
clearly perceptible, but if, as Spiritual Science enables us to do, we
survey long periods, it becomes obvious that the epochs of our earth
differ essentially from each other in character, and that we are
continually passing through new experiences. But something else, too,
must be realised — that these changes in the life of the earth itself
must be taken into account. If in a particular epoch of earthly
existence we neglect the opportunity of experiencing and learning what
that epoch has to offer, then, although we return in a subsequent
incarnation, we have missed something, we have not assimilated what we
ought to have assimilated in the previous epoch. The result is that in
the next epoch we are unable to make proper use of our forces and
faculties.</p>
<p>Speaking still in a quite general sense, it can be said that in our
epoch something is possible on earth, indeed over almost the whole
globe, that was not possible in the earlier incarnations, for example,
of men now living. Strange as it may seem, there is a certain, indeed a
great significance in this. It is possible in the present incarnation
for certain numbers of people to come to Spiritual Science; that is, to
assimilate the findings of spiritual investigation which are available
in the domain of Spiritual Science today. The fact that a few human
beings come together and receive the knowledge discovered by spiritual
investigation may of course be regarded as of no importance, but people
who hold this view do not understand the significance of reincarnation,
nor that certain things can be learnt only during <em>one</em>
particular incarnation. If they are not learnt, something has been
missed and will be lacking in the following incarnations.</p>
<p>This above all must be realised: What we learn today in Spiritual
Science becomes part of our soul, and we bring it with us when we
descend again into the next incarnation.</p>
<p>Let us now try to grasp what this means for the soul. Reference will
have to be made not only to a great deal that will already be known to
you from other lectures and from your own reading, but to many facts of
the spiritual life that are more or less new or still quite unfamiliar
to you. It is necessary first to go back, as often before, to earlier
epochs in the evolution of humanity and of the earth. We are living now
in the fifth epoch following the great Atlantean catastrophe. This epoch
was preceded by the fourth, the Greco-Latin epoch, when ideas and
experiences of paramount importance of life on earth originated among
the Greek and Latin peoples. This fourth epoch was preceded by the
Chaldean-Babylonian-Assyrian-Egyptian period, this by the original
Persian and this in turn by the ancient Indian. In a still more distant
past we come to the great Atlantean catastrophe by which an ancient
continent extending over the area of the present Atlantic Ocean was
destroyed. This continent of ancient Atlantis was gradually swept away
and the solid earth on which we are now living received its present
configuration. In still earlier epochs preceding the Atlantean
catastrophe, we come to the civilisations and forms of culture developed
on Atlantis by the Atlantean races. And these conditions were preceded
by still earlier ones.</p>
<p>A survey of what is told by history — it does not, after all, go very
far back — may easily give rise to the belief (although this is quite
unfounded even for shorter periods) that conditions of existence on our
earth were always the same as they are today. That is by no means so,
for there have been fundamental changes — most marked of all in man's
life of soul. The souls of those sitting here today were incarnated in
bodies belonging to all these epochs of earth-evolution and they
absorbed what it was possible to absorb in each of them. In each
successive incarnation the soul has developed different faculties.
Although during the Greco-Latin epoch the difference was perhaps not
quite as extreme, in the epoch of ancient Persia and even more so in
that of ancient India, our souls were entirely different from what they
are today. They were equipped with faculties of another kind altogether
in those olden times and lived under entirely different conditions. And
now, in order that what follows may be thoroughly understood, we will
visualise as clearly as possible the nature of our souls after the
Atlantean catastrophe, when they were incarnated, let us say, in the
bodies that could have existed on earth only at the time of the ancient
Indian civilisation-epoch. It must not be imagined that this
civilisation was to be found only in India itself — it was merely that
in those days the Indian peoples were of prime importance. The forms of
civilisation differed all over the earth, but they bore the stamp of the
instructions given for the ancient Indians by the Leaders of
humanity.</p>
<p>When thinking of the nature of our souls in that epoch it must be
realised at once that knowledge of the kind possessed by men of the
modern age was then quite impossible. There was as yet no consciousness
of the self, no I-consciousness as clear and distinct as that of today.
The fact that he was an I hardly entered a man's consciousness. True,
the I, the “I”, was already within man as a power, a force, but
knowledge of the I is not the same thing as the power or activity. Human
beings lacked the inwardness belonging to their nature today, but
instead of it they possessed faculties of quite another kind — faculties
we have often referred to as those of ancient, shadowy clairvoyance.</p>
<p>When we study the human soul during waking life in those times we
find that it did not really feel itself as an I; an individual felt
himself to be a member of his race or tribe, of his folk. In the sense
that the hand is a limb or member of the body, the single “I” or I stood
for the whole community of the racial stock and the folk. Man did not
feel himself to be an individual “I” as he does today; he experienced
the I as the folk-I, the tribal I. During the day he did not really know
that he was a man in the real sense. But when evening came and he went
to sleep, his consciousness was not completely darkened, as it is today;
the soul was able, during sleep, to be aware of spiritual facts — for
example, of spiritual facts and happenings in its environment of which
the dream today is a mere shadow, in most cases no longer representing
their full reality. Men had such perceptions at that time and they knew:
There is indeed a spiritual world. The spiritual world was a reality to
them, not as the result of logical reasoning, not through anything
needing proof, but because every night, even if in dim, dreamlike
consciousness, they were actually within the spiritual world. But that
was not the essential. As well as sleeping and waking life, there were
also intermediate states during which man was neither completely asleep
nor completely awake. In those states, I-consciousness was diminished
even more than by day, but on the other hand the perception of spiritual
happenings, the dreamlike clairvoyance, was essentially stronger than at
other times during the night. Thus there were intermediate states in
which men had, it is true, no I-consciousness, but were clairvoyant. In
such states a man was as if transported, entirely unaware of his
separate identity. He did not know: “I am a person”. But he knew with
certainty: “I am a member of a spiritual world, and I know that it is a
reality for I behold it.” Such were the experiences of human souls in
the days of ancient India. And in the Atlantean epoch this
consciousness, this life in the spiritual world, was even clearer;
indeed very, very much clearer ... We therefore look back to an age when
our souls were endowed with a dim, dreamlike clairvoyance which has
faded away by degrees in the course of the evolution of mankind.</p>
<p>If our souls had remained at the stage of this ancient clairvoyance,
we could not have acquired the individual I-consciousness that is ours
today; it would not have been possible for us to realise: We are humans.
We were obliged so to speak, to exchange our consciousness of the
spiritual world for I-consciousness, “I”-consciousness. In the future we
shall have both at the same time; we shall all attain that state in
which clairvoyance functions in the fullest sense while I-consciousness
is maintained intact — as can only occur today in one who has trodden
the path of Initiation. In the future it will again be possible for
everyone to gaze into the spiritual world and yet to feel himself a
person, an I.</p>
<p>Picture to yourselves once more what has taken place. The soul has
passed from incarnation to incarnation; once it was clairvoyant, then
later on the consciousness of becoming an I grew clearer and clearer and
it was increasingly possible for the soul to form its own judgments. As
long as a man still has clairvoyant vision of the spiritual world and
does not feel himself to be an I, he cannot form judgments or reason
with the intellect. The latter faculty developed steadily but with every
succeeding incarnation the old clairvoyance faded. The states in which
man was able to gaze into the spiritual world became rarer; he
penetrated more and more deeply into the physical plane, developed
logical thinking and felt himself to be an I.</p>
<p>We can therefore say that in very ancient times man was a spiritual
being, for he lived in direct intercourse with other spiritual beings as
their companion; he felt his kinship with beings to whom he can no
longer look up today with normal senses. As well as the world
immediately surrounding us there are, as we know, still other worlds,
peopled by other spiritual beings. With his normal consciousness today
man cannot see into these worlds, but in earlier times he lived in them,
both during the night-consciousness of sleep and in the intermediate
state of which we spoke. He lived within these worlds, in communion with
these other beings. Normally, this is no longer possible for him today.
He was, as it were, cast out of his home — the spiritual world — and
with every new incarnation became more firmly established in this
earthly world.</p>
<p>In the sanctuaries for the cultivation of the spiritual life, in
domains of learning and in the sciences where such things were still
known, account was taken of the fact that man had incarnated in these
different epochs of earth-evolution. Men looked back to a very ancient
epoch before the Atlantean catastrophe, when human beings lived in
direct communion with the Gods or spiritual Beings, and when their inner
life of feeling and sentient experience was naturally quite different.
You can well imagine that this was so in an epoch when the soul was
fully aware of being able to look up to the higher Beings, knowing
itself to be a member of that higher world. In considering these facts
we will remind ourselves that we can learn to speak and think today if
we grow up among human beings, for such faculties can be acquired only
through contact with men. If a child were to be put on some lonely
island today and grew up without having any contact with human beings,
he would not develop the faculties of thinking and speaking.</p>
<p>This shows that the evolution of any being is to some extent
dependent upon the species of beings among whom it grows up and lives.
That this has an effect upon evolution can be observed in the case of
animals. It is well known that if dogs are removed from conditions where
they are in contact with human beings to places where they have no such
contact, they forget how to bark: as a rule the descendants of such dogs
cannot bark at all. Something does, then, depend upon the kind of beings
among which a being grows up. You can therefore imagine that for the
same souls to live among modern men on the physical plane is a different
matter from having lived at an earlier time among spiritual Beings in a
spiritual world into which normal vision today does not penetrate. The
impulses man developed when living among men and those he developed when
living among Gods were quite different.</p>
<p>Higher knowledge has always recognised these things, has always
looked back to that ancient time when men were in direct contact with
divine-spiritual Beings. And the effect of this contact was that the
soul felt itself a member of the divine-spiritual world. But this also
engendered impulses and forces in the soul that were still of a
divine-spiritual nature — divine-spiritual in quite another sense from
that which applies to the forces of the soul today. When the soul felt
itself a member of the higher world, there spoke out of this soul a will
that also sprang from the divine-spiritual world — a will of which it
might rightly be said that it was inspired, because the soul was living
among Gods.</p>
<p>Higher knowledge speaks of this age when man was still united with
the divine-spiritual Beings as the Golden Age, or <em>Krita Yuga</em>.
It is an age of great antiquity, the most important period of which
actually preceded the Atlantean catastrophe. Then came an age when men
no longer felt their connection with the divine-spiritual world as
strongly as during Krita Yuga, when :they no longer felt that their
impulses were determined by their life with the Gods, when their vision
of the spirit and the soul was already clouded. Nevertheless, there
still remained in them a memory of their life with the spiritual Beings
and the Gods.</p>
<p>This memory was particularly distinct in ancient India. It was very
easy in those days to speak about spiritual things; one could have
directed men's attention to the outer, physically perceptible world and
yet regard it as maya or illusion, because men had not been having these
physical perceptions for so very long. So it was in ancient India. Souls
then living no longer beheld the Gods themselves, but they still beheld
spiritual facts and happenings and spiritual Beings of lower ranks. Only
a comparatively small number of people were still able to behold the
sublime spiritual Beings, and even for these the former living communion
with the Gods was already much less intense. The will-impulses from the
divine-spiritual world had already disappeared. Nevertheless, a glimpse
into spiritual facts and happenings was still possible, at all events in
certain states of consciousness: in sleep and in those intermediate
states to which reference has been made.</p>
<p>The most important facts of this spiritual world, however, which in
earlier times had been experienced as immediate reality, were now there
in the form of a kind of knowledge of truth, as something that the soul
still knew with certainty but which was now operative only in the form
of knowledge, as a truth. People still lived in the spiritual world, but
in this later age the realisation of its existence was not as strong as
it had formerly been. This period is called the Silver Age, or <em>Treta
Yuga</em>.</p>
<p>Then came the epoch of those incarnations when man's vision was more
and more shut off from the spiritual world, when his whole nature was
directed to the outer sense-world and firmly consolidated in that world;
inner I-consciousness, consciousness of humanity, became more and more
definite and distinct. This is the Bronze Age, or <em>Dvapara Yuga</em>.
Man's knowledge of the spiritual world was no longer as sublime or
direct as in earlier times, but something at least had remained in
humanity. It was as if in men of the present day who have reached a
certain age there were to remain something of the jubilance of youth ...
this is past and over but it has been experienced and known and a man
can speak of it as something with which he is familiar. Thus the souls
of that age were still in some degree familiar with experiences leading
to the spiritual worlds. That is the essential characteristic of Dvapara
Yuga.</p>
<p>But then came another age, an age when even this degree of
familiarity with the spiritual world ceased, when the doors of the
spiritual world closed. Men's vision was more and more confined to the
outer material world and to the intellect which elaborates the
sense-impressions, so that the only remaining possibility was to reflect
about the spiritual world — which is the most unsatisfactory way of
acquiring knowledge of it. What men now actually knew from their own
experience was the material-physical world. If they desired to know
something about the spiritual world, this was possible only through
reflection. It is the age when man was most lacking in spirituality and
therefore established himself firmly in the material world. This was
necessary in order that he might be able by degrees to develop
consciousness of self to its highest point, for only through the sturdy
resistance of the outer world could man learn to distinguish himself
from the world and experience himself as an individual. This age is
called <em>Kali Yuga</em>, or the Dark Age.</p>
<p>I emphasise that these designations — Krita Yuga, for example — can
also be applied to longer epochs, for before the Golden Age man
experienced and participated in still higher worlds; hence all those
earlier ages could be embraced by this name. But if, so to speak,
demands are kept moderate and one is satisfied with the range of
spiritual experience described, the periods can be divided in the way
indicated. Definite time periods can be given for all such epochs. True,
evolution progresses slowly and by degrees, but there are certain
boundary-lines of which it can be said that prior to them such-and-such
conditions of life and of consciousness predominated, and subsequently,
others.</p>
<p>Accordingly, in the sense first spoken of, Kali Yuga began
approximately in the year 3101 B.C. Thus we realise that our souls have
appeared repeatedly on the earth in new incarnations, in the course of
which man's vision has been more and more shut off from the spiritual
world and therefore increasingly restricted to the outer world of the
senses. We realise, too, that with every incarnation our souls enter
into new conditions in which there are always new things to be learnt.
What we can achieve in Kali Yuga is to establish and consolidate our
I-consciousness. This was not previously possible, for we had first to
be endowed with the I .</p>
<p>If in some incarnation souls have failed to take in what that
particular epoch has to give, it is very difficult for the loss to be
made good in later epochs. Such souls must wait a long time until the
loss can in some respect be counterbalanced. But no reliance should be
placed upon such a possibility.</p>
<p>We will therefore picture to ourselves that the result of the doors
being closed against the spiritual world was of fundamental and
essential importance. This was also the epoch of John the Baptist, of
Christ Himself on earth. In that epoch, when 3,100 years of the Dark Age
had already elapsed, a fact of salient importance was that all human
beings ,then living had already been incarnated several times — once or
twice at the very least — in the Dark Age. I-consciousness had been
firmly established; memory of the spiritual world had faded away, and if
men did not desire to lose their connection with the spiritual world
entirely, it was essential for them to learn to experience within the I
the reality of the spiritual world. The I must have developed to the
stage where it could be certain — in its inmost core at least — that
there is a spiritual world, and that there are higher spiritual Beings.
The I must have made itself capable of feeling, of believing in, the
spiritual world.</p>
<p>If in the days of Christ Jesus someone had voiced the truth in regard
to the conditions then prevailing, he might have said: In earlier times
men could experience the kingdom of heaven while they were outside their
I in those spiritual distances reached when out of the body. Man had
then to experience the kingdoms of heaven, the kingdoms of the spiritual
world, far away from the I. This is no longer possible, for man's nature
has changed so greatly that these kingdoms must be experienced within
the I itself; the kingdoms of heaven have come so near to man that they
work into his very I. And it was this that was proclaimed by John the
Baptist: The kingdoms of heaven are at hand! — that is to say, they have
drawn near to the I. Previously they were outside man, but now they are
near and man must grasp them in the very core of his being, in the I.
And because in this Dark Age, in Kali Yuga, man could no longer go forth
from the physical into the spiritual world, it was necessary for the
Divine Being, Christ, to come down into the physical world ... Christ's
descent into a man of flesh, into Jesus of Nazareth, was necessary in
order that through beholding the life and deeds of Christ on the
physical plane it might become possible for men to be linked, in the
physical body, with the kingdoms of heaven, with the spiritual world.
And so Christ's sojourn on earth took place during a period in the
middle of Kali Yuga, the Dark Age, when people who were not living in a
state of dull insensibility but understood the nature of the times could
realise: The descent of the God to men is necessary in order that a lost
connection with the spiritual world may be established once again.</p>
<p>If at that time no human beings had been able to find a living link
with Christ in their hearts and souls, the connection with the spiritual
worlds would have been gradually lost; the kingdoms of heaven would not
have been received into the Is of men. It might well have happened that
if all human beings living at that crucial point of time had persisted
in remaining in darkness, an event of such momentous significance would
have passed them by unnoticed.</p>
<p>The souls of men would have withered, gone to waste, decayed. True,
even without Christ they would have continued to incarnate for some time
still, but they would not have been able to implant in the I the power
that would have enabled them to find the link with the kingdoms of
heaven. The event of the Appearance of Christ on the earth might
everywhere have passed unnoticed — as it did, for example, in Rome. It
was alleged in Rome that a sect of sinful people were living in some
out-of-the-way, sordid alley, that among them was a wicked spirit
calling himself Jesus of Nazareth and inciting them by his preaching to
all kinds of villainous deeds. At a certain period that was all that was
known in Rome of Christ! And you may possibly also be aware that
Tacitus, the great Roman historian, wrote in a similar vein about a
hundred years after the events in Palestine.</p>
<p>Thus it was by no means universally realised that something of
supreme importance had taken place: that the Divine Light had shone into
the darkness of earth and that it was now possible for men to be brought
safely through the Kali Yuga. The possibility of further evolution for
humanity was ensured because there were certain souls who understood
what was at stake at that point of time and knew what it signified that
Christ had been upon earth.</p>
<p>If you were to transfer yourselves in thought to that time, you would
realise that it was quite possible to live without knowing anything at
all of the advent of Christ Jesus on the physical plane — it was quite
possible to live on earth without having any consciousness of this most
momentous event.</p>
<p>Would it not also be possible today for something of infinite
importance to take place without men being aware of it? Might not our
contemporaries fail to have the slightest inkling of the most important
happening in the world at the present time? It might well be so. For
something of supreme importance is taking place, although it is
perceptible only to the eyes of spirit. There is a great deal of talk
about periods of transition; we ourselves are actually living in a very
important one. And its importance lies in the fact that the Dark Age has
run its course and a new age is beginning, when slowly and by degrees
the souls of men will change and new faculties will be developed.</p>
<p>The fact that the vast majority of people are entirely unaware of
this need not be a cause of surprise, for it was the same when the
Christ Event took place at the beginning of our era. Kali Yuga came to
an end in the year 1899 and we have now to live on into a new age. What
is beginning is slowly preparing us for new faculties of soul.</p>
<p>The first indications of these new faculties will be noticeable in
isolated souls comparatively soon now, and they will become more clearly
apparent in the middle of the thirties of this century, approximately in
the period between 1930 and 1940. The years 1933, 1935 and 1937 will be
particularly important. Very special faculties will then reveal
themselves in human beings as natural gifts. Great changes will take
place during this period and biblical prophecies will be fulfilled.
Everything will change for souls who are living on earth and also for
those who are no longer in physical bodies. Whatever their realm of
existence, souls are on the way to possessing entirely new faculties.
Everything is changing — but the happening of supreme importance in our
time is a deeply incisive transformation of the faculties of the human
soul.</p>
<p>Kali Yuga is over and the souls of men are now beginning to develop
new faculties. These faculties — because this is the purpose of the
epoch — will of themselves draw forth from souls certain powers of
clairvoyance which during Kali Yuga had necessarily to be submerged in
the realm of the unconscious. A number of souls will experience the
strange condition of having I-consciousness but at the same time the
feeling of living in a world essentially different from the world known
to their ordinary consciousness. The experience will be shadowy, like a
divination, as though an operation had been performed on one born blind.
... Through what we call esoteric training these clairvoyant faculties
will be attained in a far better form. But because human beings
progress, they will appear in mankind in their very earliest beginnings,
in their most elementary stages, through the natural process of
evolution.</p>
<p>But it might very easily happen — indeed, far more easily now than at
any earlier time — that men would prove incapable of grasping this event
of such supreme importance for humanity, incapable of realising that
this denotes an actual glimpse into a spiritual world, although still
shadowy and dim. There might, for example, be so much wickedness, so
much materialism on the earth that the majority of men would show not
the slightest understanding, and regard those who have this clairvoyance
as lunatics, shutting them up in asylums together with those whose minds
are obviously deranged. This point of time might pass by without leaving
a trace, although today we too are letting the call of John the Baptist,
the forerunner of Christ, and of Christ Himself, again resound: A new
epoch is at hand when the souls of men must take a step upward into the
kingdoms of heaven.</p>
<p>The great event might very easily pass without being understood by
men. ... If between the years 1930 and 1940 the materialists were to say
triumphantly: True, there have been a number of fools but no sign
whatever of the expected great event ... this would not in the least
disprove what has been said. But if the materialists were to win the day
and mankind were to overlook these happenings altogether, it would be a
dire misfortune. Even if men should prove incapable of perceiving them,
great things will come to pass.</p>
<p>One is that it will be possible for people to acquire the new faculty
of perception in the etheric world — a certain number to begin with, and
they will be followed by more and more others, for mankind will have
2,500 years during which to develop these faculties in greater and
greater perfection. This opportunity must not be missed. If it were,
this would be a tragic misfortune and mankind would then be obliged to
wait until a later epoch in order to retrieve the lost opportunity and
subsequently to develop the new faculty. This faculty will consist in
men being able to see in their environment something of the etheric
world which hitherto they have not normally been able to see. Man now
sees only the human physical body, but then he will be able to see the
etheric body at least as a shadowy picture and also to perceive the
connection between deeper happenings in the etheric world. He will have
pictures and premonitions of happenings in the spiritual world and find
that in three or four days’ time such happenings take place on the
physical plane. We will see certain things in etheric pictures and know
that to-morrow or in a few days’ time this or that will happen.</p>
<p>These faculties of the human soul will be transformed. And what is
associated with this? The Being we call the Christ was once on earth in
the flesh at the beginning of our era. He will never come again in a
physical body, for that was a unique event and will not be repeated. But
He will come again in an etheric form in the period indicated. Men will
learn to perceive Christ inasmuch as through this etheric sight they
will grow towards Him. He does not now descend as far as the physical
body but only as far as the etheric body; men must therefore grow to the
stage where He can be perceived. For Christ spoke truly when He said: “I
am with you always, even unto the end of the days of earth.” He is
present in our spiritual world ... and those especially blessed can
always see Him in this spiritual, etheric world.</p>
<p>A man who was convinced with particular intensity through such
perception, was Paul — in the vision at Damascus. But this etheric sight
will develop in individual human beings as a natural faculty. In days to
come it will be more and more possible for men to experience what Paul
experienced at Damascus.</p>
<p>We are now able to grasp quite a different aspect of Spiritual
Science. We realise that it is a preparation for the actual event of the
new Appearance of Christ. Christ will appear again inasmuch as with
their etheric sight men will raise themselves to Him. When this is
understood, Spiritual Science is disclosed as the means of preparing men
to recognise the return of Christ, in order that it shall not be their
misfortune to overlook this event but that they shall be mature enough
to grasp the great happening of the Second Coming of Christ. Men will
become capable of seeing etheric bodies and among them, too, the etheric
body of Christ; that is to say, they will grow into a world where Christ
will be revealed to their newly awakened faculties.</p>
<p>It will then no longer be necessary to amass all kinds of documentary
evidence to prove the existence of Christ; there will be eye-witnesses
of the presence of the Living Christ, people who will know Him in His
etheric body. And from this experience they will realise that this is
the same Being who at the beginning of our era fulfilled the Mystery of
Golgotha, that He is indeed the Christ. Just as Paul at Damascus was
convinced at the time: This is Christ! ... so there will be men whose
experiences in the etheric world will convince them that in very truth
Christ lives.</p>
<p>The supreme mystery of the age in which we are living is the Second
Coming of Christ — that is its true nature. But the materialistic mind
will in a certain sense appropriate this event. What has now been said —
that all the data of genuine spiritual knowledge point to this age —
will often be proclaimed in the years immediately ahead. But the
materialistic mind corrupts everything today, and what will happen is
that this kind of thinking will be quite incapable of conceiving that
the souls of men must advance to the stage of etheric sight and
therewith to vision of Christ in the etheric body.</p>
<p>Materialistic thinking will conceive of this event as a descent of
Christ in the flesh, as an incarnation in the flesh. A number of persons
in their boundless arrogance will turn this to their own advantage and
announce themselves as the reincarnated Christ. The near future may
therefore bring false Christs, but anthroposophists should be so fully
prepared for spiritual life that they will not confuse the return of
Christ in a spiritual body, perceptible only to higher vision, with a
return in a physical body of flesh. This will be one of the most
terrible temptations besetting mankind and to lead men past this
temptation will be the :task of those who learn through Spiritual
Science to rise in the true sense to an understanding of the Spirit, who
try not to drag spirit down into matter but to ascend into the spiritual
world themselves. Thus we may speak of the return of Christ and of the
fact that we rise to Christ in the spiritual world through acquiring the
faculty of etheric vision.</p>
<p>Christ is ever present, but He is in the spiritual world. We can
reach Him when we rise into that world. All anthroposophical teaching
should be transformed within us into an indomitable will not to allow
this event to pass unnoticed but in the time that remains to us
gradually to educate human beings who will be capable of developing
these new faculties and therewith <em>to unite anew with Christ</em>.
Otherwise, before such an opportunity could again arise, humanity would
have to wait for long, long ages ... indeed, until a new incarnation of
the earth. If this event of the return of Christ were to be overlooked,
the vision of Christ in the etheric body would be restricted to those
who are willing to fit themselves for such an experience through
esoteric training. But the really momentous fact of these faculties
being acquired by humanity in general, by all men, of this great event
being understood by means of faculties developing naturally in all men
... that would be impossible for long, long ages.</p>
<p>Obviously, therefore, there is something in our age that justifies
the existence and the work of Spiritual Science in the world. Its aim is
not merely to satisfy theoretical needs or scientific curiosity. To
prepare men for this great event, to prepare them to take their rightful
place in the epoch in which they live and with clarity of understanding
and knowledge to perceive what is actually present but may pass humanity
by without being brought to fruition — such is the aim of Spiritual
Science.</p>
<p>It will be of the utmost importance to recognise and understand this
event of Christ's Appearance, for it will be followed by other events.
Just as other happenings preceded the Christ Event in Palestine, so will
those who prophetically foretold His coming follow Him after the time
referred to, after He Himself has become visible to mankind again in the
etheric body. The preparers of His coming will be recognisable in a new
form to people who have experienced the new Christ Event. Those who
lived on earth as Moses, Abraham and the Prophets will be recognisable
once again. And it will be known that just as Abraham preceded Christ as
a preparer, he also takes over the mission, after Christ's coming, of
being a helper in His work. Thus a man who does not sleep through the
event of supreme importance in the immediate future gladly finds his way
into fellowship with all those who, as the Patriarchs, preceded the
Christ Event; he allies himself with them. The whole choir of those to
whose level we shall thus be able to rise is again revealed. The one who
led mankind downwards to the physical plane appears again after Christ
and leads men upwards again, unites them again with the spiritual
worlds. [See the following lecture.]</p>
<p>Looking far back into the past we come .to that point of time in the
evolution of humanity of which we say: from then onwards humanity
descends farther and farther away from the spiritual world into the
physical world. Although the following picture also has its material
aspect, it can nevertheless be used here. In earlier times man was a
companion of spiritual Beings and because his spirit lived in the
spiritual world he was a <em>son of the Gods</em>. But the soul,
descending ever more deeply into bodily incarnation, participated to a
constantly increasing extent in the outer world. The son of the Gods
within man took delight in the daughters of the earth, that is to say in
those souls who were drawn to the physical world. This in turn means:
the human spirit, in earlier times charged through and through with
divine spirituality, sank down into physical materiality, became the
spouse of the brain-bound intellect and by it was entangled in the web
of the physical world of the senses. And now the human spirit must
re-ascend along the path by which the descent was once made and become
again a son of the Gods. The human spirit which had become the son of
man would perish in the physical world if this son of man were not to
climb upwards again to the Divine Beings, to the light of the spiritual
world, finding delight in times to come in the daughters of the Gods. It
was necessary for the evolution of mankind that the sons of the Gods
should unite with the daughters of men, with the souls who are fettered
to the earth, in order that as the son of man the human spirit should
learn to master the physical plane. But it is necessary that the human
being of the future, the son of man, shall take delight in the daughters
of the Gods, in the divine-spiritual light of wisdom with which he must
unite in order then to grow upwards again into the world of the
Gods.</p>
<p>The <em>will</em> of man must be fired by the divine wisdom, and the
most powerful impulse for this will be if to those who have truly
prepared themselves the sublime ether-form of Christ Jesus becomes
perceptible. To a person in whom natural clairvoyance has developed this
will be like a Second Coming of the Christ Jesus, just as the etheric
Christ appeared as a spiritual Being to Paul. Christ will appear again
to men when they realise that they must use to this end the faculties
with which evolution itself will equip the human soul.</p>
<p>Let us therefore use Spiritual Science not merely to satisfy our
curiosity, but in such a way that it will make us worthier to fulfil the
great tasks and missions devolving upon the human race.</p>
<p>Answer given by Dr. Steiner to questions:</p>
<p>When light has been thrown, as it has been today, upon mysteries of a
more intimate kind, let us not treat them as thoughtlessly as certain
subjects are wont to be treated today, but realise that Anthroposophy
must be for us something altogether different from a theory. The
teaching has, of course, to be given; for how would it be possible to
rise to thoughts such as have been voiced today if they could not be
received in the form of teaching? The essence of this teaching, however,
is that it does not remain as such but is re-moulded in the soul into
qualities of heart and character, into an entirely different attitude of
mind, making different men of us. The teaching should guide us how to
make the right use of our incarnations so that in the course of them we
can develop into something quite different.</p>
<p>I have tried not to say a word too much or too little and have
therefore given only fleeting indications of matters of great moment.
But What has been said is of significance not only for the souls who
will be incarnated on the physical plane in the period from 1930 to 1940
but also for those who will then be in the spiritual world between death
and a new birth; souls work down from the spiritual world into the world
of the living, even though the latter may know nothing of it. Through
the new Christ Event, this communion between souls who are incarnated
here on the physical plane and souls already in the spiritual world will
become an increasingly conscious communion. Active co-operation between
human beings in incarnation and spiritual beings will then be possible;
this should already have been indicated when it was said that the
Prophets appear again among men on the earth.</p>
<p>You have therefore to conceive that when these great times arrive in
the future there will be a more conscious mutual co-operation between
men in the physical world and in the spiritual world. This is not
possible today because of the absence of a common language. Here in the
physical world the only words men use in their languages designate
physical things and physical conditions. The world in which human beings
live between death and a new birth is quite different from the world
immediately surrounding us, and they speak a different language. The
Dead can take in only what is spoken in the sense of Spiritual Science —
nothing else. Therefore in Anthroposophy we are cultivating something
that will be more and more intelligible to the Dead and we are speaking
also for those who are living between death and a new birth.</p>
<p>Humanity is passing into a new era when the strength of the
influences from the spiritual world will steadily increase. The great
events of the immediate future will be perceptible in all worlds. Those,
too, who are living between death and a new birth will have new
experiences as the result of the new Christ Event in the etheric world.
But if they made no preparation in themselves while on earth, they would
no more understand the event than would men incarnated on the earth,
unless these had prepared themselves to respond in the right way. It is
essential for all souls now incarnated — no matter whether they will
then still be in physical incarnation or not — that .through the
assimilation of anthroposophical truths they should prepare themselves
for these important future events. If they fail to receive into their
earthly consciousness what Anthroposophy or Spiritual Science has to
give, they will have to wait for a new incarnation in order to have the
possibility here on earth of assimilating the corresponding teachings.
For there are things that can be experienced and learnt only on
earth.</p>
<p>Hence it is said that in the spiritual world there is, for example,
no possibility of knowing death — and it was necessary for a God to
descend into the physical world in order that He might die. Knowledge of
what the Mystery of Golgotha is can be acquired in no other world in the
way that is possible in the physical world. We have been led down into
the physical world in order to acquire something that can be acquired
only there. And Christ came down to humanity because it was only in the
physical world that He could reveal to human beings — could enable them
to experience in the Mystery of Golgotha — something that, having let
its fruits ripen in the spiritual world, carries those fruits onward.
But the seeds must be laid down and spread abroad in the physical
world.</p>
