5.  The human being needs spiritual self-knowledge for inner peace. He
    finds himself in his thinking, feeling and willing. He sees how
    thinking, feeling and willing are dependent upon the natural human
    being. Where health and illness are concerned, they must follow the
    physical body in its strength and debilitation. Sleep extinguishes
    them. Life's experiences show how dependent spiritual experience is
    on the physical body. One may therefore come to the conclusion that
    self-knowledge is lost midst these everyday experiences. Then the
    essential question arises: whether self-knowledge and therewith
    certainty about the true self beyond ordinary experience, is even
    possible. Anthroposophy wishes to answer this question based upon
    sound spiritual experience. It is not based on mere opinion or
    belief, but on experience of the spirit, which is as certain as the
    experience of the body.

6.  When we look at lifeless nature we find a world revealed in coherent
    relationships. We investigate these relationships and find that they
    are the functions of natural laws. But we also find that through
    these laws lifeless nature unites with the earth as a whole. From
    this unification of the lifeless with the earth, we can then proceed
    to a contemplation of the plant-world. We see how the cosmos beyond
    the earth sends the forces from outer space which extracts life from
    the lap of the lifeless. We become aware of the essence in the
    living which extracts from the mere earthly and manifests what works
    down upon the earth from the distance of cosmic space. In the most
    insignificant plant we become aware of the essence of the cosmic
    light beyond the earth, just as a luminous object is reflected in
    the eye. By such enhanced contemplation we can observe the
    difference between the earthly/physical, which governs the lifeless,
    and the outer- earthly/etheric, which acts in living things.

7. We find man as an ensouled spiritual being placed in this
    earthly and outer-earthly world. As long as he is in the earthly
    element, which contains the lifeless, he carries his physical body
    with him; when he develops the forces which insert the living from
    the cosmos into the earthly, he has an etheric or life-body. This
    contrast between the earthly and the etheric has been completely
    overlooked by modern thinking. For this reason, the most irrational
    views about the etheric have ensued. Fear of losing one's self in
    the fantastic has prevented discussion of this contrast. Without
    consideration of this contrast, however, no insight into Man and
    World is possible.


8. One can contemplate the nature of man insofar as it is revealed
    by his physical and his etheric body. We find, however, that
    whatever is revealed from these sources does not lead to
    consciousness, but remains in the unconscious. Consciousness is not
    illuminated, but darkened when the physical and etheric bodies'
    activity is increased. Even fainting spells can be the result of
    such increases in activity. Through such observations we realize
    that something is active in the human organization -- and in animals
    as well -- which is not the same as what is active in the physical
    and etheric. It is not active when the physical and the etheric
    elements are active through their own forces, but when these cease
    their activity. We arrive thus at the concept of the astral body.

9.  The reality of the astral body is found when we advance from
    meditation by the thinking which is stimulated from without to inner
    contemplation. For this one must inwardly seize the thinking
    stimulated from without and intensively experience it in the soul as
    such, without relation to the outer world; and then, by means of the
    soul-strength acquired by this seizing and experiencing, become
    aware of the fact that inner organs of perception exist, which
    spiritually see where the animal and human physical and the etheric
    bodies are bounded, in order that consciousness can arise.

10. Consciousness does not arise through a continuation of those
    activities which derive from the physical and etheric bodies; rather
    both of these bodies must reach rock-bottom, or even below that, in
    order to "make room" for consciousness. They are not the originators
    of consciousness, but merely provide the platform on which the
    spirit must stand in order to generate consciousness in earthly
    life. Just as man on earth needs a platform on which to stand, the
    spirit needs the material foundation of earth on which it can
    evolve. However, as a planet in space does not need a ground under
    it in order to claim its place, so the spirit -- whose contemplation
    is not directed through the senses towards the material, but by its
    own forces towards the spiritual -- does not need this material
    foundation in order to trigger its conscious activity.


11. Self-consciousness, which summarizes itself in the "I", alights
    from consciousness. This happens when the physical and etheric
    bodies are deconstructed by their own forces, thereby allowing the
    emergence of the spiritual in man. The deconstruction of these
    bodies creates the ground on which consciousness is born.
    Reconstruction must follow, however, if the organism is not to be
    destroyed. Therefore, if for the experience of consciousness
    deconstruction takes place the deconstructed must be reconstructed.
    Self-consciousness lies in the perception of this construction. One
    can follow this process by interior vision. One can sense how the
    conscious is transformed into the self-conscious in that one creates
    from one\'s self an afterimage of the merely conscious. The
    consciousness possesses its own image in the organism vacated, as it
    were, through deconstruction. It becomes self-consciousness when the
    emptiness is re-filled from within. The being capable of this
    fulfillment is experienced as "I".

12. The reality of the "I" is found when inner contemplation -- by
    means of which the astral body is cognitively grasped -- is
    developed further and living thinking is permeated with the will in
    meditation. At first one has devoted one's self will-less to this
    thinking. Thereby one has allowed a spiritual element to enter into
    this thinking, just as color and sound enter the eye and the ear
    when perceived by the senses. In this way, what one has passively
    been able to bring to life in consciousness can be recreated by an
    act of will, and in this act of will the perception of one's own "I"
    is enabled.
