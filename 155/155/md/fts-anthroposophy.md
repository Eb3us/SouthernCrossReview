# Anththroposophy – an Introduction

## by Frank Thomas Smith

*This introduction is based on a course given by the author in Argentina.*

There is nothing secret about anthroposophy. An enormous literature
on the subject exists, including many books and lectures (more than
6,000) by Rudolf Steiner, published in German. A relatively small
portion has been translated into Spanish, but what is available is
more than sufficient for anyone who desires to be well informed.
Literature by other authors also exists.

As anthroposophy is intimately connected with Rudolf Steiner,
it will be convenient to say a few words about him before going into
the material itself. Steiner was born in 1861 in what was then a
part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, then became Yugoslavia and is
now Croatia. His father, a hunter by profession, was chief of a
railroad station in a small rural town. Steiner was a gifted child,
so his parents later moved close to Vienna so he could continue his
studies. Aside from his intellectual capacities, he had other gifts.
He could “see” elemental beings in nature, for example. When,
however, he realized that no one else shared these clairvoyant
experiences, he decided to remain silent about them.

After graduating from the Technological University of Vienna, he
obtained his doctorate in philosophy from the University of Rostock
in Germany. He worked for several years in the Goethe archives in
Weimar, where he edited Goethe’s scientific works. (It isn’t widely
known that Goethe was a scientist as well as Germany’s greatest
poet.) Goethe made a profound impression on Steiner, for in him he
found similarities to his own way of thinking. For example, Goethe
proposed his theory of the “Urpflanze” (primal plant), from which,
according to him, all vegetal life originated. He described this
Urpflanze to Schiller, another great German poet, who remarked that
it was all very interesting, but no more than an idea after all.
Goethe replied: But I **see** this idea.

During his time in Weimar, Steiner wrote his “Philosophy of
Freedom”.

Although this is a purely philosophical work, Steiner later said
that it really contains anthroposophy, only described in a different
way. Afterwards he was editor of various literary journals in
Berlin, until he was discovered by the Theosophists, his future
wife, Marie von Sivers, being one of them. There Steiner found
people to whom he could speak openly about his esoteric knowledge
and experiences. He lectured regularly at the Theosophical Society
and was eventually named secretary general of the German branch of
the Society.

The split came when the theosophical leaders declared that
Krishnamurti – then a ten year old boy – was the reincarnation of
Christ. Steiner said this was nonsense. Whether he resigned or was
asked to do so isn’t clear, but in any case he took most of the
German members with him and formed the Anthroposophical Society.
When he was older, by the way, Krishnamurti denied that he was the
reincarnation of Christ and went his own admirable way.

Over the course of the years Steiner wrote and gave many lectures
about diverse subjects: medicine, agriculture, religion, science,
the arts, the social question, spiritual development – even the life
of bees. There is hardly a subject that he didn’t analyze at one
time or another.

Rudolf Steiner died in Dornach, Switzerland – headquarters of the
Anthroposophical Society – in 1925, a little over a year after the
first Goetheanum, the building made mostly of wood that he designed
and worked on for ten years, was destroyed by fire.

The second Goetheanum, made of poured concrete, stands on the same
spot today.

#### The Nature of the Human Being

The human soul is studied in psychology and religion, the physical
body in medicine and physiology. In Freudian psychology the soul is
no more than a biological function of the unconscious. The spirit is
left unattended. But it wasn’t always so. At a ninth century Church
council, it was decided that man consisted of body and soul, and not
the trinity of body, soul and spirit. Since then soul and spirit
have been essentially synonymous. This is obviously a grave error if
in fact the human being has a body, soul **and** a spirit. In order
to affirm this, we will have to define the difference between the
two.

The physical body is the material element that we see with our
physical eyes. And the soul? If I stand in the open here in
Traslasierra and gaze up at the star-filled sky, I will experience a
feeling of awe, even happiness. These feelings are functions of the
soul. But then if I begin to ask myself what the stars are made of
and why they’re there at all, and here comes the moon: beautiful, my
soul says, but my spirit wonders how long it will take to cross the
sky and if that crescent shape isn’t formed by the earth’s shadow.
This function, thinking, is an attribute of the spirit, the I, the
immortal, self-aware, individual component of the human being.    

Now let’s complicate the situation somewhat and enter into more
detail. The physical body is composed of the same substances as its
environment: minerals, chemicals, liquids, etc. But if it were only
that it would lie in bed like Frankenstein’s monster before getting
the electric shock. It has life, and that cannot be explained by
chemical formulas, or electricity. Let’s call this life component
the “life body”, which plant and animal life also possesses. But
what plants do not possess is the “astral” body, closely identified
with the soul. Animals and humans on the other hand do have an
astral body. Animals are conscious, have sensations, experience pain
and joy, hunger and, above all instincts. But, despite having
various degrees of intelligence according to species, they do not
think and aren’t self-aware. In other words, they have no individual
I. Only the human being possesses this component.

During the course of evolution, the I works on the astral body in
order to transform it into a more elevated vehicle – denominated
“Spirit-self” in the above diagram. It works on the life body to
transform it into the “Life-spirit“ and, finally, it will transform
the physical body into the “Spirit-man”. The latter two
transformations are relegated to the distant future, so distant that
these transformations will occur during future incarnations of the
earth itself. We are still occupied with the transformation of the
astral body – with lesser or greater success, depending upon the
individual.

#### REINCARNATION AND KARMA

Now, to complicate things even further, we will say a few words
about reincarnation and karma. A few days ago I read in the
newspaper about a ship in Africa carrying a cargo of children
kidnapped or sold in one country to be re-sold as slaves in another.
This reminded me of Dosteyevsky’s “The Brothers Karamazov”,

when Ivan, one of the brothers, says that he cannot believe in a God
who permits children to suffer. An even if he existed, Ivan would
reject him. This is the best argument I know for reincarnation and
karma (the law of destiny). How do we explain the fact that often
the good and the innocent suffer and the evil prosper? There are two
explanations. Either the suffering is the result of actions in a
past life, or new karma is being created and the suffering will be
compensated for in a future life. There’s also the question of
evolution and development. It is generally accepted that more
complex organisms develop from simpler ones over the ages. And what
about the human soul? Shouldn’t the same law hold true? There is a
spiritual evolution – an evolution of consciousness – as well as an
organic one. From incarnation to incarnation we strive to develop.
Of course environment and genetics play a role in determining
whether or not we are successful. If genius could be explained
genetically however, the children of geniuses should also be
geniuses. They are not. We all know from experience that siblings –
even twins – are almost always very different personalities.     

According to Steiner, after death we experience our past life in
temporal reverse, and must experience the suffering we caused in
others. 

#### EDUCATION AND THE SOCIAL QUESTION

The relation between Anthroposophy and Education is exemplified in
the more than 900 Waldorf schools and 1,000 kindergartens that exist
worldwide. We will not go into the Waldorf educational method here,
as that is being done by the teachers in the meetings with parents.
However, education, Anthroposophy and the social question have much
to do with each other. Just think: the first Waldorf school was
founded for the workers of a cigarette factory. The founder, the
owner of the factory, wasn’t an educator. He was much more
interested in Steiner’s social ideas. Here’s an example from *Basic

“*This book must assume the unpopular task of showing that the
chaotic condition of our public life derives from the dependence of
spiritual/cultural life on the political state and economic
interests. It must also show that the liberation of spiritual life
and culture from this dependence constitutes an important element of
the burning social question*.”

By “spiritual/cultural life”, Steiner is referring, above all, to
education, which was originally in the hands of the Church and was
then taken over by the political state, a necessary historical step
in order to make education available to all. However, persisting in
state control of education in a time when it is no longer necessary
is destructive, if not fatal. We all know that the Argentine school
system is in chaos. We tend to blame economic conditions for this.
Of course the schools here are under-financed, of course teachers
are paid miserable salaries. But did you know that in the so-called
first world where enormous amounts of money are invested in public
education, the school systems are also in a state of continual
crisis? Steiner maintained that the principle cause of this chaos
was, in his time, the dependence of the school system on the
political state and economic interests. In other words, that the
teachers were not free to teach the children in the children’s own
interests. I maintain that little has changed in this respect.

All this raises a lot of questions, like: someone’s got to control
what the teachers do. If not the state, then who? But why should
anyone control the teachers? Who knows better than they, who are
with the children every day, what their needs are? Especially in
Waldorf schools where the same teacher stays with the group through
the entire primary years. Of course the college of teachers of each
school must exercise some control. If a teacher is doing the wrong
thing or maybe shouldn’t even be a teacher – it happens – then that
group must take the necessary action.

This is one of the most important innovations in education, which
has been practiced exclusively by Waldorf schools: that the teachers
must be responsible for the schools administration and direction.
Here’s Rudolf Steiner on this point:

*The administration of education, from which all culture develops,
must be turned over to the educators. Economic and political
considerations should be entirely excluded from this administration.
Each teacher should arrange his or her time so that he can also be
an administrator in his field. He should be just as much at home
attending to administrative matters as he is in the classroom. No
one should make decisions who is not directly engaged in the
educational process. No parliament or congress, nor any individual
who was perhaps once an educator, is to have anything to say. What
is experienced in the teaching process would then flow naturally
into the administration. By its very nature such a system would
engender competence and objectivity.*

It is often difficult for parents, school boards and other officials
to understand and accept the fact that teachers are not employees,
and that they (Board members) are there to support, assist and
advise the teachers and not to give them orders. Once this is
comprehended and the spirit of solidarity and freedom enters the
community, the school will flourish.  

Another question involves financing. If the state doesn’t control
the schools, can it still be expected to finance them? The money to
finance schools in any country comes from the productive
institutions – industry – of that country. It makes a detour through
the state in the form of taxes. The state then distributes a portion
of those taxes to public schools and therefore considers that it has
the right to oversee what the schools do with that money. Perhaps it
would be unrealistic to expect the state to act otherwise. The funds
for education could, however, be paid directly to a non-governmental
educational organization, which would then distribute them to the
schools. Or, if it is not that unrealistic to expect the state to do
otherwise, it could finance the schools and at the same time insure
the teachers’ right to educational freedom. All this is only a
matter of changing the procedure once the decision has been made to
free the schools from state control – which could be done in a
democratic society if enough people want it.

Nowadays, when it is recognized that the state is incompetent to
manage industry, it’s curious that this same state is judged
competent to manage education – an area more important than
industry, because without education there would be no industry.

#### The Tripartite Society

This idea of free schools was a part of Steiner’s concept of a
threefold or tripartite society. Education suffers because it is
dependent on the political state. The political state suffers
because it is dependent on economic interests. Does anyone doubt
this? The name of the game in politics today is to make laws that
the economic interests want and think they need. Today just about
all governments are pushing the free market ideology. Without
defending or criticizing free markets, we should nevertheless ask
what they have to do with human and civil rights, the defense of
which is the legitimate function of the state?

The motto of the French revolution was Liberty, Equality, Fraternity
– a beautiful motto.

But the government the revolutionaries imposed failed when the motto
became Liberty, Equality and the guillotine. Their error was trying
to organize a unitary state containing all three elements. Liberty
is a characteristic of the spiritual/cultural sphere, as explained
above. Equality is a political concept: all citizens have equal
rights. The state can and should guarantee rights, but it should not
be able to restrict freedom in the process.

And what about the third element: fraternity? We only have one
sphere of social activity left, and it would seem difficult to
attribute fraternity to the economic sphere. But if we look at
economics more closely, we will see that it is quite correct to do
so. Economic activity consists of three elements: Production,
distribution (wholesale, retail) and consumption. In the production
process goods are produced in order to be consumed. And who consumes
them? Mostly those who did **not** produce them. Therefore we have
one group, producers, working to make goods for others, the
consumers. This is essentially a fraternal process. Of course if you
ask anyone in the productive sphere why he works, he will say he
works for money. Well, this is a problem of consciousness and the
way things are organized. They could be organized differently.
Steiner suggested that **Economic Associations** of representatives
of Producers, Distributors and Consumers be formed. These
associations would make the decisions relating to the economic
sphere, for they are the ones active in it.

Centrally planned economies, such as the communists attempted in the
Soviet bloc, China, Cuba and elsewhere, are eminently inefficient
and lead to an excess of state power. Capitalism is efficient, but
it leads to social injustice. Furthermore, the so-called free market
is never really free, because the producers control it. They plan
all right – for their own benefit. But if all three basic elements –
producers, middlemen and consumers – met in associations, they could
do the planning required to benefit society as a whole and still
leave the market relatively free.

Another problem is the ownership of the means of production.
Nowadays most industrial power is in the hands of a few holdings.
The big guys are consuming the little ones. It is almost as though
Karl Marx’s theory was coming true: that those with the most capital
would eventually absorb those with less capital until one huge
capitalist unit ruled the word. The Marxist solution to this was to
turn the means of production over to the state. That failed
miserably. We should remember, however, that Communism was a
reaction to Capitalism’s injustices, which have not been resolved.
The means of production, capital, should be in the hands of all
those who actually do the producing – not anonymous shareholders.

The basic concept of the threefold, or tripartite society is that
the spiritual/cultural, the political and the economic spheres of
society should each enjoy relative autonomy, and that none should
dominate the other. It could be objected that this is a nice idea,
but no more than that. Steiner said otherwise. He maintained that
the human being, consisting of Body, Soul and Spirit, that is,
threefold, **needs** a society that is also threefold: the spiritual
sphere in which his potentially free spirit may develop; the rights
sphere where his soul feels the justice and injustice of society,
and the economic sphere where his physical needs are produced.

#### A Philosophy of Freedom

This is the title of one of Rudolf Steiner’s earliest books. It is
purely philosophical and therefore may cause problems for those who
have no knowledge of that branch of thinking. I taught the subject
for ten years in the Teachers’ Training Seminar in Buenos Aires and
it took me half that time to realize that since most of the students
had only the vaguest notion of philosophy (my own notion being
somewhat less vague), it would be better to start with a general
history of philosophy and get to Steiner later. From then on I had
the impression that the students (and I) understood better what it
was all about. That was a twenty-hour course and we don’t have the
time to do that here, so I’ll just assume that we’re all
philosophers.

“Is man in his thinking and acting a spiritually *free* being, or is
he compelled by the iron necessity of purely natural law?” This is
the first line of the book and it is the question Steiner will try
to answer using philosophical arguments throughout. He also writes
that “we are dealing here with one of the most important questions
for life, religion, conduct and science.”

In order to answer this question, the concepts of dualism and monism
are elucidated, dualism being the separation between us and the
world around us. That is, if I observe any object in nature, a tree
let’s say, I feel that I, the subject, am looking at an object, the
tree, which is separate from me. This is a barrier that we erect as
soon as we have consciousness – we become conscious of our
antithesis to the world, the universe appears to us in two parts: I
and the world. The striving to bridge this antithesis constitutes
the spiritual striving of humanity. To be able to do so would
constitute the monism we are seeking. The question is how.

According to Steiner, the answer can be found in thinking, which he
considered to be a spiritual activity. He even suggested that the
English translation of his book be entitled “The Philosophy of
Spiritual Activity”. Put simply, the argument is that if we observe
our own thinking, we are overcoming the duality of subject vs.
object in that the subject – “I” – is observing something which is
completely of its own making: the object: “thinking”. Therefore, the
subject and the object become one. If this is possible, then it is
also possible for objects outside of myself. When we observe the
physical object “tree”, we are seeing only a part of it. The other
part, the idea “tree”, is lacking. The chairs you are sitting on
certainly exist physically. But before they existed someone had the
idea “chair” – the carpenter or designer, someone, or the chairs
couldn’t exist. And we can share this idea “chair” with the
carpenter. And the tree? If the tree exists physically, the idea
“tree” must have existed previously. Therefore the whole tree
consists of its physical manifestation that we observe with our eyes
and the concept or idea “tree” which we can observe by means of
thinking.

“*We can find nature outside us only if we have first learned to
know her* within *us. What is akin to her within us must be our
guide. This marks out our path of inquiry. We shall attempt no
speculations concerning the interaction of nature and spirit. Rather
shall we probe into the depths of our own being, to find there those
elements which we saved in our flight from nature*.”

Are there limits to knowledge? Steiner seems to say that any such
limits are self-imposed and that the object of knowledge is merely
relative to the perceiving subject.  “*As soon as the I, which is
separated from the world in the act of perceiving, reintegrates
itself into the world continuum through thoughtful contemplation,
all further questioning ceases, having been a consequence of the
separation*.” This seems to me a clue as to what kind of thinking is
meant here. Certainly not to the usual thoughts that come and go
willy-nilly, but what Steiner calls something more profound: “*not a
shadowy copy of some reality, but a self-sustaining spiritual
essence…that is brought into consciousness for us through
intuition.  Intuition is the conscious experience—in pure spirit—of
a purely spiritual content. Only through an intuition can the
essence of thinking be grasped*.” In this sense, the physical
organization, i.e., the brain, can have no influence on the
*essential nature* of thinking. Of course the brain is necessary for
thinking, just as a piano or other instrument is necessary for
playing music, but such instruments – and the brain is an instrument
– are not the essence of music.

Steiner disagrees with Kant on two basic issues. One, that we cannot
know the “thing in itself” because we are dependent on our fallible
senses. And two, his principle of morality: “Act so the basis of
your action may be valid for all men”. For Steiner, “*the standard
can never be the way all men would act, but rather what, for me, is
to be done in each individual case*.” In other words, what he called
*ethical individualism*. “*I act…not because I acknowledge a lord
over me, or an external authority, or a so-called inner voice; I
acknowledge no external principle for my action, because I have
found in myself the ground for my action, namely, my love of the
action. I do not work out mentally whether my action is good or bad;
I carry it out because I **love** it*.” 

In answer to the question posed at the beginning: whether the human
being, in his acts and thinking is free or not, Steiner says finally
that a true philosophy of freedom does not consider man as a
finished product, so it considers the dispute as to whether man is
free or not (now) to be irrelevant. It sees in man a developing
being and only asks whether the stage of the free spirit can be
attained during this development.

There is very much more in “The Philosophy of Freedom” than can be
discussed in these few minutes. Anyone who is interested in what
freedom is and in Rudolf Steiner’s philosophical concepts which led
to his later writings and lectures of a more esoteric nature, will
do well to read it carefully. To close this subject, I think the
following words appropriate: “*Hence, every person, in their
thinking, lays hold of the universal primordial Being which pervades
all people. To live in reality, filled with the content of thought,
is at the same time to live in God*.”

#### Anthroposophy and Religion

The word religion is derived from the Latin “re-ligere” = reunite.
In this sense of reuniting the spiritual in humankind with the
spiritual in the universe, anthroposophy is religious. It is not a
religion however, nor is it associated with a church or confession,
but it recognizes all religions as being true it their own way.
Steiner placed enormous importance in the life, death and
resurrection of Jesus Christ. In his books and lectures on this
subject, he explains Christianity’s essence and most of its
mysteries in a way quite different from the teachings of the
traditional confessions. A study of Steiner’s basic works, followed
by his lectures on this specific subject, can open the reader’s eyes
to the meaning of many so-called mysteries and give him or her a new
appreciation of Christianity, one she never knew existed.

I would like to emphasize here that anthroposophy is **not** taught
to the children in Waldorf schools. Steiner himself insisted on
this. Otherwise the schools would be considered sectarian. There is
no such thing as an “anthroposophical school”. There are only
schools – Waldorf Schools – in which the pedagogy is based on an
anthroposophical understanding of the nature of man.

"Anthroposophy is a path of cognition from the spiritual in man to
the Spiritual in the Universe."
