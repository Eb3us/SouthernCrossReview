# My Esoteric Education, How I Became an Anthroposophist, and How To Know Higher Worlds

## by Monique Sanchíz de Mihalitsianos

It’s one of those nights again where I can’t get any sleep. I’ve
been thinking about this lately and decided to use this time under
the disappointingly clouded night-sky to type it all down.
Heeereeee it goes:

I was re-introduced to esoterism at the age of 14. I say
reintroduced because I’m sure I’ve studied it before, in my past
lives. I was raised Protestant Christian (my mother’s influence on
the household) in a Catholic country, with a non-practicing
Catholic father. I grew up religious. I read a lot of fantasy
books growing up, a lot of epic novels. I played a lot of sports
(still do so). I was a normal kid with a happy, healthy life.

The shift came when my first boyfriend lent me a few of his books
on Metaphysics.

There was one fundamental idea in those books that changed the way
I looked at things, and it was this: There’s another reality
beyond the physical reality that we can approach in the form of
ideas, and when we engage with these ideas, new neural pathways
are formed in the brain, which in turn influences how we behave,
which directly affects our reality. In other words, our thoughts
create our reality.

He also lent me a book called *The Kybalion: Hermetic Philosophy*
about the seven principles of existence. The Kybalion was authored
by the “Three Initiates” (whoever they are), and its seven
principles of existence are:   

> 1. Mentalism: The ALL is MIND—The Universe is mental.  
> 2. Correspondence: As above, so below, as below so above.   
> 3. Vibration: Nothing rests, everything moves, everything
> vibrates.   
> 4. Polarity: Everything is Dual; everything has poles;
> everything has its pair of opposites; like and unlike are the
> same; opposites are identical in nature, but different in
> degree; extremes meet, all truths are but half-truths; all
> paradoxes may be reconciled.   
> 5. Rhythm: Everything flows, all things rise and fall.   
> 6. Cause and Effect: Every Cause has its Effect; every Effect
> has its Cause; everything happens according to Law; Chance is
> but a name for Law not recognized; there are many planes of
> causation, but nothing escapes the Law.  
> 7. Gender: Everything has its masculine and feminine principles,
> gender manifests on ALL planes. 

I started viewing the world through the lens of these seven
principles of existence and saw that it was true—these are the
laws of reality.

About a year later, a friend invited me to a philosophical
organization with strong theosophical inclinations. It was in this
school that I was introduced to Madame Blavatsky. I read all of
her *Isis Unveiled*, which is a torrent of information. It was
during this time that I also started reading Plato and studying
all different kinds of religions.

A guy from this school was studying Blavatsky’s cosmogenesis (the
creation of the cosmos) from her *Secret Doctrine*. While doing so
he had come across some research regarding Anthropogenesis (the
creation of mankind) from an Austrian philosopher called Rudolf
Steiner.

This guy told me that Rudolf Steiner thought that before
understanding the creation of the world it was imperative that we
understand the creation of man, because the cosmos is so complex
that we cannot firmly grasp how it’s built before understanding
ourselves first. This, he told me, was only one of the many
ideological differences between Theosophy and Anthroposophy, the
esoteric movement founded by Rudolf Steiner… another main
difference being that Rudolf Steiner believed that man could
become an initiate without necessarily having a guru to guide him
every step of the way.

I was intrigued, but not enough to start my own research on the
subject.

When I turned 17 I dropped out of the organization, mainly because
I felt it was infringing on my freedom and because I wasn’t
willing to accept their dogma. The guy who had introduced me to
Rudolf Steiner also dropped out because of ideological
differences. I ended up marrying him 5 years later, actually. His
name is Miguel (Michael in Spanish).

Around the time I turned 18, Miguel went on a business trip to
Argentina and came back with a present to me: the book *An Outline
of Occult Science* by Rudolf Steiner.

He wasn’t studying Anthroposophy, but he saw this book on his
visit to the library and was reminded of what he’d read about
Steiner. He knew that Occult Science was one of Steiner’s major
works, and that I had been talking a lot about human freedom and
about the idea that we don’t necessarily need a guru to become
enlightened, that we could find out the truth for ourselves. So
Miguel bought it for me thinking I would resonate with the
material.

I read it… and it was dense. Even for me, who had read *Isis
Unveiled*. But from the little I understood, I knew something was
there. And I continued to be intrigued. Very intrigued. Here was
an occultist who was taking an entirely new approach to this kind
of knowledge, a western approach. I had studied so much eastern
spirituality that this was refreshing. This man was a scientist.
He was logical, not mystical.

I read some of Steiner’s other books, including *The Fifth
Gospel*, several times during the course of three years. I also
read some of his lectures.

The understanding of Steiner’s Fifth Gospel led to a profound and
very emotional return to Christianity for me, which I had
abandoned at 14 when I first started studying esotericism and
accepted all religions as truth. In a way, Steiner helped me
rediscover my faith. But even though I admired him immensely as an
occultist and I gave credit to his work for my return to
Christianity, I didn’t consider myself an anthroposophist.

Then, quite accidentally, I stumbled upon a book in college that
once again changed things for me entirely. I was 21 years old at
the time.

I remember the class, Maritime Law. The professor was droning on
and on about things that were already in the textbook, so I zoned
out and started surfing the Internet with the campus’s free WiFi
on my MAC while pretending to take notes.

I went to amazon.com and typed ‘Rudolf Steiner’ in the search box,
and started scrolling. I saw a book with a pretty cool drawing,
very impressionist in my opinion, and I clicked on it.

*How to Know Higher Worlds*

Hmm.

I googled the book. There was a free .pdf available. I started reading immediately.

The book stirred a deep vocation in me for the Spirit. This was
the path! This is the manual, the guide. Finally I found it, a
Path of Initiation into the Mysteries that I could follow and also
profoundly understand.

And it was a noble path. The first chapter speaks of cultivating
Reverence, or deep admiration for everything that is true and good
and beautiful. Deep admiration for those powers and forces who are
superior to us and who seek to guide us into the truth. It also
speaks of loving your neighbor, of working for the world, of being
of service to others.

As I said, I am a kid who grew up on stories like Lord of the
Rings and Harry Potter, epic brave fantasy novels. This means I
grew up aware of the fight of good versus evil and of the
importance of heroic, virtuous acts. For me *How To Know Higher
Worlds* is the path of the JEDI.

If I liked Rudolf Steiner before, this book took it to a whole
other level. From that point on, I started downloading, buying,
and reading Steiner e-books on my amazon kindle e-reader. I
basically read everything on the market.

All of this led me to become an anthroposophist. Not suddenly, but
gradually, after prolonged thought and inner questioning about
whether this was the philosophy I wanted to follow the rest of my
life. And it was. I remember the day I declared it to myself: “I
am an anthroposophist”.

I have read HTKHW easily more than 15 times in the span of the
last 4 years (I am 25 now). I pick it up and read through it about
every four months or so.

The book feels different every time I pick it up. Or I’m in a
different mood, or something. Sometimes I read new sections with
an expanded comprehension. Other times I unravel things I hadn’t
understood, or thought I understood but really didn’t. One time,
even, I read over an entire three pages of information that I had
totally glazed over before. And good information, too, about the
etheric currents surrounding our bodies and hands.

My relationship with this book keeps evolving. I follow the
exercises, but not perfectly. There’s a part in the book where
Steiner says that what matters isn’t that we’re perfect, but that
we always have the intention of striving towards the Spirit and of
working on ourselves honestly. That’s what I try to do, every day.

As for the clairvoyance?

Well, there’s another part in the book where it says that if we
still don’t understand what we’re seeing, then the less we try to
define it to ourselves or explain it to others, the better. That
way we don’t form judgments and our mind remains flexible for when
we absorb more information in the future, and start seeing the
whole picture and are able to understand it all.

Also, the desire for clairvoyance, to want to be clairvoyant just
for the sake of seeing stuff in the spiritual worlds, is a selfish
desire and the higher powers constantly retreat from it. In other
words, the more you want it, the more you’ll be denied it. You
have to focus on the exercises because you want to develop
yourself and be of service to the world. The clairvoyance is
secondary.

As a hypothetical example, let’s say that I possess some form of
clairvoyance, however rudimentary or dim. If I admitted it
publicly it would serve little more than boasting, and the emotion
behind this boasting would be pride. As a result of this pride,
the perception would retreat. Perhaps for days, even weeks. That’s
just how it works.

If I could condense the entire practical wisdom of this book in 4
exercises, they would be the following:   

> 1. OBSERVATION: Observe yourself and others. Detach yourself
> from your opinions and study the world as objectively as
> possible.   
> 2. MEDITATION: Retreat into the spiritual worlds. Make time in
> your day where you separate the essential from the inessential,
> the transcendental (Spirit) versus the untrascendental
> (Form).   
> 3. CONTEMPLATION: Think about your actions, your feelings, and
> your thoughts. Judge yourself fairly, from a third person
> perspective. If you can’t judge yourself with honesty, how will
> you grow?   
> 4. REVERENCE: Devotion to higher forces, concepts, principles,
> truths. Continuous attention and focus on everything virtuous
> and worthy of respect.

There are also practical exercises like the observation of plants,
stones, animals, sounds, conversations, and human activity to
develop clairvoyant faculties, as well as an in-depth explanation
of all of the soul qualities necessary to develop the throat and
heart chakras so that they start rotating and we can actively
participate in greater currents of energy. The Buddha’s eightfold
path actually fully develops one of these two chakras, I can’t
remember which.

In conclusion, How To Know Higher Worlds is not only my favorite
book, but also the one that has had the most impact in my life as
a spiritual seeker, and definitely the book that led me to
declaring myself an anthroposophist. It is the manual that I hope
to continue to use until the moment of my death, and I hope to
absorb and interiorize as many truths from it as possible to take
with me to my next life.

I’m starting to realize other people don’t necessarily think the
same way I do. I know this sounds foolish, but it’s the truth. For
example, I’m starting to realize that maybe some people don’t even
think about their next lives, or what they want to take over from
this life into the next one. For some people the term ‘occultism’
might even cause discomfort. Or pupilhood, or initiates or even
mysteries.

Since I spent my entire adolescence familiarizing myself with
these terms, and also terms like guru, master and discipleship;
terms taken out of the traditional esoteric schools of wisdom that
originated in ancient times, these terms don’t cause me any kind
of discomfort, but I’m starting to emotionally understand that
others might have different approaches to this. So I ask you to
please try to understand from my point of view what it was like,
just like I will try to understand yours.

In contrast, Steiner’s whole approach to esotericism initially
struck me as very ‘laissez-faire’. But it was a difference that I
quickly grew to love as I became more aware of what initiation
meant on the western path. Just to illustrate -

This was my experience of the concept of initiation with
theosophy:

Teacher: The only path of initiation into the mysteries is through
a guru, through the path of discipleship. Blavatsky had her gurus,
Koot Hoomi and Lord Moria, and we have to work on ourselves and
wait patiently for a master to appear and lead the way.

This was my experience of the concept of initiation with
anthroposophy:

Steiner: Hey, girl. You’ve been reading through my stuff and I’ve
noticed you’re interested in the path of initiation into the
mysteries. Want some tools so you can get to know them yourself?

Me: Yeah! Cool!

Steiner: Okay. I’m going to tell you because you deserve it. But
you have to use this knowledge for good and not for selfish
reasons. And I’m not your master. I won’t ever tell you what to
do, that’s up to you. But I am your friend. (introduces How To
Know Higher Worlds)

Me: Wow. Thanks, you rock.

And the book slowly started to change things. Which I will not go
into now.

As to my status as an ‘occult pupil’, or an active seeker of the
Spirit, or an aspirant to the mysteries, or an esoteric scholar,
or a JEDI, or you get what I’m saying… as to how I’m doing in THAT
field…

I’m one of the kids in the back of the room getting into trouble
instead of focusing on the class, which is such a shame because I
could be an A+ student but instead I’m just scraping by with C’s.
That’s my status. And I’m okay with it, because hey, at least I
know the material well enough that I’m not flunking.

Now, I’m off to try to get some ZZZ’s. Good Night. ☺
