<h4>Preface to the Fourth German Edition (1920)</h4>
      <br />
<p class="intro">The challenges which contemporary society presents will be
misunderstood by those who approach them with utopian ideas. It is of
course possible to believe that any one of diverse theories, arrived at
through personal observation and conviction, will result in making
people happy. Such a belief can acquire overwhelming persuasive power.
Nevertheless, as far as the social question of the times is concerned,
it becomes irrelevant as soon as the attempt is made to assert it.</p>
<p>The following example, although seeming to carry this proposition to
an extreme, is nevertheless valid. Let us assume that someone is in
possession of a perfect, theoretical solution to the social question. In
spite of this, in attempting to offer it to the public he becomes the
victim of an unpractical belief. We no longer live in an age in which
public life can be influenced in this way. People's minds are simply not
disposed to accept the ideas of another as far as this subject is
concerned. They will not say: here is someone who knows how society
should be structured, so we will act according to his opinions.</p>
<p>People are not interested in social ideas which are presented to them
in this way. This book, which has already reached a fairly large
audience, takes this phenomenon into consideration. Those who accuse it
of having a utopian character have completely misunderstood my
intentions. It is interesting to note that such criticism has come
principally from people who themselves indulge almost exclusively in
utopian thinking and are inclined to attribute their own mental habits
to others.</p>
<p>Truly practical people know from experience that even the most
convincing utopian ideas lead absolutely nowhere. In spite of this, many
of them seem to feel obliged to propound just such ideas, especially in
the field of economics. They should realize that they are wasting their
breath, that their fellow contemporaries will not be able to apply such
propositions.</p>
<p>The above should be treated as a fact of life inasmuch as it
indicates an important characteristic of contemporary public life,
namely, that our present notions concerning economics, for example, have
little relation to reality. How can we then hope to cope with the
chaotic condition of society if we approach it with a thought process
which has no relation to reality?</p>
<p>This question can hardly meet with favor as it requires the admission
that our thinking is indeed remote from reality. Nevertheless, without
such an admission we will not get to the bottom of the social question.
Only when we understand that this divorce of thought from reality is a
condition of the utmost seriousness for contemporary civilization, can
we become clear in our own minds as to what society really needs.</p>
<p>The whole question revolves around the shape of contemporary
spiritual or cultural life. Modern man has developed a spiritual life
which is to a very large extent dependent upon political institutions
and economic forces. While still a child he is given over to a state
educational system, and his upbringing must correspond to the economic
circumstances of his environment.</p>
<p>It is easy to believe that this situation results in the individual
becoming well-adjusted to contemporary life, that the state is best
qualified to organize the educational system for the benefit of the
community. It is also easy to believe that the individual who is
educated according to the economic conditions of his environment and who
is then placed according to these conditions becomes the best possible
member of human society.</p>
<p>This book must assume the unpopular task of showing that the chaotic
condition of our public life derives from the dependence of spiritual
life on the political state and economic interests. It must also show
that the liberation of spiritual life and culture from this dependence
constitutes an important element of the burning social question.</p>
<p>This involves attacking certain wide-spread errors. For example, the
political state's assumption of responsibility for education has long
been considered to be beneficial for human progress. For people with
socialistic ideas it is inconceivable that society should do anything
but shape the individual according to its standards and for its
service.</p>
<p>It is not easy to accept a very important fact of historical
development, namely, that what was proper during an earlier period can
be erroneous for a later period. For a new era in human relations to
emerge, it was necessary that the circles which controlled education and
culture be relieved of this function and that it be transferred to the
political state. However, to persist in this arrangement is a grave
social error.</p>
<p>The first part of this book attempts to indicate this. Human culture
has matured toward freedom within the framework of the political state,
but it cannot exercise this freedom without complete autonomy of action.
The nature which spiritual life has assumed requires that it constitute
a fully autonomous member of the social organism. The administration of
education, from which all culture develops, must be turned over to the
educators. Economic and political considerations should be entirely
excluded from this administration. Each teacher should arrange his or
her time so that he can also be an administrator in his field. He should
be just as much at home attending to administrative matters as he is in
the classroom. No one should make decisions who is not directly engaged
in the educational process. No parliament or congress, nor any
individual who was perhaps once an educator, is to have anything to say.
What is experienced in the teaching process would then flow naturally
into the administration. By its very nature such a system would engender
competence and objectivity.</p>
<p>Of course one could object that such a self-governing spiritual life
would also not attain to perfection. But we cannot expect perfection; we
can only strive toward the best possible situation. The capabilities
which the child develops can best be transmitted to the community if his
education is the exclusive responsibility of those whose judgment rests
on a spiritual foundation. To what extent a child should be taught one
thing or another can only be correctly determined within a free cultural
community. How such determinations are to be made binding is also a
matter for this community. The state and the economy would be able to
absorb vigor from such a community, which is not attainable when the
organization of cultural institutions is based on political and economic
standards.</p>
<p>Even the schools which directly serve the state and the economy
should be administered by the educators: law schools, trade-schools,
agriculture and industrial colleges, all should be administered by the
representatives of a free spiritual life. This book will necessarily
arouse many prejudices, especially if the consequences of its thesis are
considered. What is the source of these prejudices? We recognize their
antisocial nature when we perceive that they originate in the
unconscious belief that teachers are impractical people who cannot be
trusted to assume practical responsibilities on their own. It is assumed
that all organization must be carried out by those who are engaged in
practical matters, and educators should act according to the terms of
reference determined for them.</p>
<p>This assumption ignores the fact that it is just when teachers are
not permitted to determine their own functions that they tend to become
impractical and remote from reality. As long as the so-called experts
determine the terms of reference according to which they must function,
they will never be in a position to turn out practical individuals who
are equipped for life by their education. The current anti-social state
of affairs is the result of individuals entering society who lack social
sensitivity because of their education. Socially sensitive individuals
can only develop within an educational system which is conducted and
administered by other socially sensitive individuals. No progress will
be made towards solving the social question if we do not treat the
question of education and culture as an essential part of it. An
anti-social situation is not merely the result of economic structures,
it is also caused by the anti-social behavior of the individuals who are
active in these structures. It is anti-social to allow youth to be
educated by people who themselves have become strangers to reality
because the conduct and content of their work has been dictated to them
from without.</p>
<p>The state establishes law-schools and requires that the law they
teach be in accordance with the state's own view of jurisprudence. If
these schools were established as free cultural institutions, they would
derive the substance of their jurisprudence from this very culture. The
state would then become the recipient of what this free spiritual life
has to offer. It would be enriched by the living ideas which can only
arise within such a spiritual environment. Within a spiritual life of
this nature society would encounter the men and women who could grow
into it on their own terms. Worldliness does not originate in
educational institutions organized by so-called 'experts', in which
impractical people teach, but only in educators who understand life and
the world according to their own viewpoints. Particulars of how a free
culture should organize itself are outlined in this book.</p>
<p>The utopian-minded will approach the book with all kinds of doubts.
Anxious artists and other spiritual workers will question whether talent
would be better off in a free culture than in one which is provided for
by the state and economic interests, as is the case today. Such doubters
should bear in mind that this book is not meant to be the least bit
utopian. No hard and fast theories are found in it which say that things
must be this way or that. On the contrary, its intention is to stimulate
the formation of communities which, as a result of their common
experience, will be able to bring about what is socially desirable. If
we consider life from experience instead of theoretical preconceptions,
we will agree that creative individuals would have better prospects of
seeing their work fairly judged if a free cultural community existed
which could act according to its own values.</p>
<p>The 'social question' is not something which has suddenly appeared at
this stage of human evolution and which can be resolved by a few
individuals or by some parliamentary body, and stay resolved. It is an
integral part of modern civilization which has come to stay, and as such
will have to be resolved anew for each moment in the world's historical
development. Humanity has now entered into a phase in which social
institutions constantly produce anti-social tendencies. These tendencies
must be overcome each time. Just as a satiated organism experiences
hunger again after a period of time, so the social organism passes from
order to disorder. A food which permanently stills hunger does not
exist; neither does a universal social panacea. Nevertheless, men can
enter into communities in which they would be able to continuously
direct their activities in a social direction. One such community is the
self-governing spiritual/cultural branch of the social organism.</p>
<p>Observation of the contemporary world indicates that the spiritual
life requires free self-administration, while the economy requires
associative work. The modern economic process consists of the
production, circulation and consumption of commodities. Human needs are
satisfied by means of this process and human beings are directly
involved in it, each having his own part-interest, each participating to
the extent he is able. What each individual really needs can only be
known by himself, what he should contribute he can determine through his
insight into the situation as a whole. It was not always so, and it is
not yet the case the world over; but it is essentially true as far as
the civilized inhabitants of the earth are concerned.</p>
<p>Economic activity has expanded in the course of human evolution. Town
economies developed from closed household economies and in turn grew
into national economies. Today we stand before a global economy.
Undoubtedly the new contains much of the old, just as the old showed
indications of what was to come. Nevertheless, human destiny is
conditioned by the fact that this process, in most fields of economic
endeavor, has already been accomplished. Any attempt to organize
economic forces into an abstract world community is erroneous. In the
course of evolution private economic enterprise has, to a large extent,
become state economic enterprise. But the political states are not
merely the products of economic forces, and the attempt to transform
them into economic communities is the cause of the social chaos of
modern times. Economic life is striving to structure itself according to
its own nature, independent of political institutionalization and
mentality. It can only do this if associations, comprised of consumers,
distributors and producers, are established according to purely economic
criteria. Actual conditions would determine the scope of these
associations. If they are too small they would be too costly; if they
are too large they would become economically unmanageable. Practical
necessity would indicate how inter-association relations should develop.
There is no need to fear that individual mobility would be inhibited due
to the existence of associations. He who requires mobility would
experience flexibility in passing from one association to another, as
long as economic interest and not political organization determines the
move. It is possible to foresee processes within such associations which
are comparable to currency in circulation.</p>
<p>Professionalism and objectivity could cause a general harmony of
interests to prevail in the associations. Not laws, but men using their
immediate insights and interests, would regulate the production,
circulation and consumption of goods. They would acquire the necessary
insights through their participation in the associations; goods could
circulate at their appropriate values due to the fact that the various
interests represented would be compensated by means of contracts. This
type of economic cooperation is quite different from that practiced by
the labor-unions which, although operational in the economic field, are
established according to political instead of economic principles.
Basically parliamentary bodies, they do not function according to
economic principles of reciprocal output. In these associations there
would be no 'wage earners’ using their collective strength to demand the
highest possible wages from management, but artisans who, together with
management and consumer representatives, determine reciprocal outputs by
means of price regulation - something which cannot be accomplished by
sessions of parliamentary bodies. This is important! For who would do
the work if countless man-hours were spent in negotiations about it? But
with person to person, association- to association agreements, work
would go on as usual. Of course it is necessary that all agreements
reflect the workers' insights and the consumers' interests. This is not
the description of a utopia. I am not saying how things should be
arranged, but indicating how people will arrange things for themselves
once they activate the type of associative communities which correspond
to their own insights and interests.</p>
<p>Human nature would see to it that men and women unite in such
economic communities, were they not prevented from doing so by state
intervention, for nature determines needs. A free spiritual life would
also contribute, for it begets social insights. Anyone who is in a
position to consider all this from experience will have to admit that
these economic associations could come into being at any moment, and
that there is nothing utopian about them. All that stands in their way
is modern man's obsession with the external organization of economic
life. Free association is the exact opposite of this external organizing
for the purpose of production. When men associate, the planning of the
whole originates in the reasoning of the individual. What is the point
of those who own no property associating with those who do! It may seem
preferable to 'justly' regulate production and consumption externally.
Such external planning sacrifices the free, creative initiative of the
individual, thereby depriving the economy of what such initiative alone
can give it. If, in spite of all prejudice, an attempt were made today
to establish such associations, the reciprocal output between owners and
non-owners would necessarily occur. The instincts which govern the
consideration of such things nowadays do not originate in economic
experience, but in sentiments which have developed from class and other
interests. They were able to develop because purely economic thought has
not kept pace with the complexities of modern economics. An unfree
spiritual life has prevented this. The individuals who labor in industry
are caught in a routine, and the formative economic forces are invisible
to them. They labor without having an insight into the wholeness of
human life. In the associations each individual would learn what he
should know through contact with another. Through the participants'
insight and experience in relation to their respective activities and
their resulting ability to exercise collective judgment, knowledge of
what is economically possible would arise. In a free spiritual life the
only active forces are those inherent in it; in the same sense, the only
economic values active in an associatively structured economic system
would be those which evolve through the associations themselves. The
individual's role would emerge from cooperation with his associates. He
could thereby exert just as much economic influence as corresponds to
his output. How the non-productive elements would be integrated into
economic life will be explained in the course of the book. Only an
economic system which is self-structured can protect the weak against
the strong.</p>
<p>We have seen that the social organism can arrange itself into two
autonomous members able to support each other only because each is
self-governing according to its inherent nature. Between them a third
element must function: the political state. Here is where each
individual who is of age can make his influence and judgment felt. In
free spiritual life each person works according to his particular
abilities; in the economic sphere each takes his place according to his
associative relationship. In the context of the political rights-state
the purely human element comes into its own, insofar as it is
independent of the abilities by means of which the individual is active
in spiritual life, and independent of the value accrued to the goods he
produces in the associative economic sphere.</p>
<p>I have attempted to show in this book how hours and conditions of
labor are matters to be dealt with by the political rights-state. All
are equal in this area due to the fact that only matters are to be
treated in it about which all men are equally competent to form an
opinion. Human rights and obligations are to be determined within this
member of the social organism.</p>
<p>The unity of the whole social organism will originate in the
independent development of its three members. The book will show how the
effectiveness of capital, means of production and land use can be
determined through the cooperation of the three members. Those who wish
to solve the social question by means of some economic scheme will find
this book impractical. However, those who have practical experience and
would stimulate men and women to cooperative ventures through which they
can best recognize and dedicate themselves to the social tasks of the
day, will perhaps not deny that the author is in fact advocating
something which is in accordance with the practical facts of life.</p>
<p>This book was first published in 1919. As a supplement I published
various articles in the magazine", <em>Dreigliederung des Sozialen
Organismus</em> which subsequently appeared as a separate volume with
the title <em>In Ausführung der Dreigliederung des Sozialen
Organismus</em>. In both of these publications much more emphasis is
placed on the means which should be employed than on the ends, or
'objectives' of the social movement. If we think realistically we know
that particular ends appear in diverse forms. Only when we think in
abstractions does everything appear to us in clearly defined outlines.
The abstract thinker will often reproach the practical realist for lack
of distinctness, for not being sufficiently 'clear' in his
presentations. Often those who consider themselves to be experts are in
reality just such abstractionists. They do not realize that life can
assume the most varied forms. It is a flowing element, and if we wish to
move with it we must adapt our thoughts and feelings to this flowing
characteristic. Social tasks can be grasped with this type of thinking.
The ideas presented in this book have been drawn from an observation of
life; an understanding of them can be derived from the same source.</p>
