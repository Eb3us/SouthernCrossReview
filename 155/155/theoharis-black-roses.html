<h3>America's War Economy and the Urgent Call for Peace in the Middle East</h3>
<h2>By <a href="https://tomdispatch.com/authors/liztheoharis/">Liz Theoharis</a></h2>


</header>

<main>
<p class="intro">On September 19, 2001, eight days after 9/11, as the leaders of both
parties were already pounding a frenzied drumbeat of war, a diverse
group of concerned Americans released a warning about the long-term
consequences of a military response. Among them were veteran civil
rights activists, faith leaders, and public intellectuals, including
Rosa Parks, Harry Belafonte, and Palestinian-American Edward Said. Rare
public opponents of the drive to war at the time, <a
href="https://ips-dc.org/justice-not-vengeance-read-our-2001-statement-on-the-9-11-attacks/">they
wrote</a> with level-headed clarity:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We foresee that a military response would not end the terror.
Rather, it would spark a cycle of escalating violence, the loss of
innocent lives, and new acts of terrorism… Our best chance for
preventing such devastating acts of terror is to act decisively and
cooperatively as part of a community of nations within the framework of
international law… and work for justice at home and abroad.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span id="anchor"></span>Twenty-three years and more than two wars
later, this statement reads as a tragic footnote to America’s Global War
on Terror that left an entire region of the planet immiserated. It
contributed to the direct and indirect deaths of <a
href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/05/15/war-on-terror-911-deaths-afghanistan-iraq/">close
to 4.5 million people</a>, while costing Americans <a
href="https://www.nationalpriorities.org/cost-of/war/">almost $9
trillion</a> and counting.</p>
<p>The situation is certainly different today. Still, over the last few
weeks, those prophetic words, now 22 years old, have been haunting me,
as the U.S. war machine kicks into ever higher gear following the
horrific Hamas massacre of Israeli civilians and the brutal
intensification of the decades-long Israeli siege of civilians in Gaza.
Sadly, the words and actions of our nation’s leaders have revealed a
staggering, even willful, historical amnesia about the disastrous
repercussions of America’s twenty-first-century war-mongering.</p>
<p>Case in point: recently, the United States was the only nation to <a
href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2023/10/1142507">veto</a> the U.N.
Security Council resolution calling for “humanitarian pauses” to deliver
life-saving aid to Palestinians in Gaza. Instead, all but a <a
href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/4276005-these-democrats-voted-against-resolution-backing-israel/">few
members</a> of Congress are lining up to support billions more in
military aid for Israel and the further mobilization of our armed forces
in the Middle East. These moves, <a
href="https://twitter.com/imetatronink/status/1715088591192481923?s=46&amp;t=lFK_jhprIfUAeHP0Tf9SdQ">experts
say</a>, may only accelerate wider regional conflict (something we are
already seeing glimmers of vis-à-vis Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, and Yemen) at
a time of increasingly profound global instability. In the last few
weeks, the <a
href="https://cepa.org/article/huge-us-naval-force-off-israel-comes-with-costs/">U.S.
Navy has</a> “assembled one of the greatest concentrations of power in
the Eastern Mediterranean in 40 years,” while the Department of Defense
is <a
href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/israel-hamas-war-gaza-palestinians/card/u-s-picks-troops-to-prepare-for-potential-deployment-to-middle-east-0pYNLxiZ7dmUbN6NxCML">readying
thousands</a> of troops for possible deployment. Meanwhile, college
administrators are suggesting <a
href="https://twitter.com/jeannetheoharis/status/1714808818830319640?s=46&amp;t=mZ2xQMEzkMP8JjX44bwwgw">student-reservists</a>
be prepared in case they get called up in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Amid this frenzy of American bluster and brawn, the U.N. agency for
Palestinian refugees reports that Gaza is “<a
href="https://www.axios.com/2023/10/14/gaza-humanitarian-crisis-hamas-israel-war-death-toll">fast
becoming a hell hole</a>,” riddled with death, disease, starvation,
thirst, and displacement. Hundreds of scholars of international law and
conflict studies have warned that the Israeli military may already have
launched a “<a
href="https://twailr.com/public-statement-scholars-warn-of-potential-genocide-in-gaza/">potential
genocide</a>” of Gazans. At the same time, within Israel,
citizen-militias, <a
href="https://www.jewishpress.com/news/left-vs-right/ben-gvir-was-derided-for-efforts-to-fortify-civilian-communities-against-terrorist-attacks/2023/10/22/">armed
by</a> the far-right minister of national security, have escalated
violent attacks on Palestinians, only worsened by the acts of armed
Israeli settlers on the West Bank protected by that very military.</p>
<p>Finally allowing a tiny amount of aid across the Egypt-Gaza border,
after <a
href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/gaza-cut-off-from-food-water-and-fuel-as-israels-punishing-bombardment-continues">shutting
down</a> all food, water, and fuel for Gaza, Israeli Defense Minister
Yoav Gallant <a
href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/gallant-we-cant-say-no-to-the-us-on-humanitarian-aid-given-how-much-they-do-for-us/">made
it clear</a> just how much power the United States wields over this
unfolding humanitarian crisis. “The Americans insisted,” he reported,
“and we are not in a place where we can refuse them. We rely on them for
planes and military equipment. What are we supposed to do? Tell them
no?”</p>
<p>As Gallant implied, the U.S. could use its influence not only to
demand far more aid for Gazans, but to compel quite a different course
of action. There should, after all, be no contradiction between
condemning Hamas for its heinous slaughter in the south of Israel and
denouncing Israel for its decades-old dispossession and oppression of
the <a
href="https://www.newarab.com/news/july-august-1-palestinian-killed-day-israel">Palestinian
people</a> and its now-indiscriminate killing and destruction in Gaza.
There need be no contradiction between decrying terrorism and demanding
diplomacy over violence. In truth, the Biden administration could use
every non-military tool at its disposal to pressure both Hamas and
Israel to pursue an immediate ceasefire, the full release of all
hostages, and whatever humanitarian assistance is now needed.</p>
<p>If only, rather than <a
href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/10/biden-pledges-military-aid-political-support-for-israel-amid-gaza-war">further
militarizing</a> the region or questioning the <a
href="https://x.com/BeckyCNN/status/1717928315816731114?s=20">death
toll</a> in Gaza, the Biden administration were to focus on making this
most recent and ever more ominous crisis a final turning point, not for
yet more <a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/sep/06/israel-imposing-apartheid-on-palestinians-says-former-mossad-chief">brutality</a>,
but for a long-term political solution focused on achieving real peace,
human rights, and equality for everyone in the region. In this moment of
grief and rage, when tensions are at a fever pitch and the wheel of
history is turning around us, it’s time to demand peace above all
else.</p>
<p><strong>The Cruel Manipulation of the Poor</strong></p>
<p>While the U.S. government refuses to use its considerable power as
leverage for peace, ordinary Americans seem to know better. Unlike the
days after 9/11, recent polls suggest that a <a
href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/israel-hamas-war-biden-opinion/">majority
of Americans</a> oppose sending more weapons to Israel and support
delivering humanitarian aid to Gaza, including a majority of people
under the age of 44, as well as a majority of Democrats and independents
and a significant minority of Republicans. While Representative Rashida
Tlaib, the only Palestinian-American in Congress, was made a pariah and
is in the process of <a
href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/rep-marjorie-taylor-greene-files-censure-resolution-accusing-rep-rashi-rcna122329">being
censured</a> by some of her colleagues after her <a
href="https://www.newsweek.com/rashida-tlaib-refuses-back-down-1837183">plea</a>
for a ceasefire, she actually represents the popular will of a
significant portion of the public.</p>
<p>And that, in turn, represents a generational shift from even a decade
or two ago. In the wake of this country’s disastrous wars in Afghanistan
and Iraq, as well as dozens of other military conflicts globally, many
Americans, especially Millennials and Gen Zers, see the U.S. military
less as a defender of democracy than as a purveyor of death and chaos.
Nearly second-by-second online coverage of the Israeli bombing campaign
is offering Americans an unprecedented view into the collective
punishment of more than two million Gazans, <a
href="https://www.npr.org/2023/10/18/1206897328/half-of-gazas-population-is-under-18-heres-what-that-means-for-the-conflict">half
of them 18 or younger</a>. (Now, with limited Internet and <a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/27/gaza-internet-cutoff-israel-siege-casualties">communications</a>,
it’s unclear how word of what’s happening in Gaza will continue to get
out.) Add to that the slow-burning pain that has marked life in the
United States over the last 15 years — the Great Recession, the Covid-19
economic shock, the climate crisis, and the modern movement for racial
justice — and the reasons for such a relatively widespread urge for
peace become clearer.</p>

<p>Today, half of all Americans are <a
href="https://thehill.com/changing-america/respect/poverty/590453-survey-finds-over-half-of-americans-cant-afford-a-1000/">either
impoverished or one emergency away</a> from economic ruin. As younger
generations face what often feels like a dead-end future, there’s a
growing sense among those I speak to (as well as older folks) that the
government has abandoned them. At a moment when the Republicans (and
some Democrats) argue that we can’t afford universal healthcare or
genuine living wages, the military budget for 2023 is <a
href="https://www.armed-services.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/fy23_ndaa_agreement_summary.pdf">$858
billion</a> and the Pentagon still <a
href="https://www.democracynow.org/2023/2/14/david_vine_us_bases_china_philippines#:~:text=And%20indeed%2C%20the%20750%20U.S.,or%20people%20in%20world%20history.">maintains
750 military bases</a> globally. Last week, without a touch of irony,
Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who <a
href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11151469/Biden-told-NOT-cancel-student-loan-debt-Janet-Yellen-Jill-Kamala-pushed-him.html">claimed
last year</a> that student debt relief would hurt the economy, <a
href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/secretary-of-treasury-janet-yellen-says-us-can-absolutely-afford-israel-ukraine-wars">insisted</a>
that the U.S. can “certainly afford two wars.”</p>
<p>Millions of us tuned into President Biden’s Oval Office speech on his
return from Israel, only the second of his presidency. There, he asked
Congress to earmark yet <a
href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-100-billion-request-congress-ukraine-israel/">another
$100 billion</a> mainly for American military aid to Israel, Ukraine,
and Taiwan (a boon to the war-profiteering weapons makers whose CEOs
will grow even richer thanks to those new contracts). Just a year after
Congress <a
href="https://www.npr.org/2022/01/27/1075299510/the-expanded-child-tax-credit-briefly-slashed-child-poverty-heres-what-else-it-d">killed
the Expanded Child Tax Credit</a>, which had <a
href="https://www.epi.org/blog/child-tax-credit-expansions-were-instrumental-in-reducing-poverty-to-historic-lows-in-2021/">cut
official child poverty in half</a>, Biden’s speech represented a further
pivot away from socially beneficial policymaking and toward further
strengthening of the ravenous engine of our war economy. After the
speech, the <em>Nation</em>’s Katrina vanden Heuvel <a
href="https://twitter.com/katrinanation/status/1715166075858407582?s=46&amp;t=lFK_jhprIfUAeHP0Tf9SdQ">offered</a>
this compelling instant commentary: “Biden tonight rolled out a version
of twenty-first-century military Keynesianism. Let’s call his policy
just that. No more Bidenomics. And it consigns the U.S. to endless
militarization of foreign policy.”</p>
<p>A decision to organize our economy yet more around war will also mean
the further militarization of domestic policy, with dire consequences
for poor and low-income people. Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., once
called such steps the “<a
href="https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/beyond-vietnam">cruel
manipulation of the poor</a>,” a phrase he coined as part of his
denunciation of the Vietnam War in the late 1960s. King was then
thinking about the American soldiers fighting and dying in Vietnam “on
the side of the wealthy, and the secure, while we create a hell for the
poor.”</p>
<p>Today, a similar “cruel manipulation” is playing out. For years, our
leaders have invoked the myth of scarcity to justify inaction when it
comes to widespread poverty, growing debt, and rising inequality in the
United States. Now, some of them are calling for the spending of
billions of dollars to functionally fund the bombardment and occupation
of impoverished Gaza and a violent Israeli clampdown in the West Bank,
not to speak of the possibility of a wider set of Middle Eastern wars.
However, polling numbers suggest that a surprising number of Americans
have seen through the fog of war and are perhaps coming to believe that
our nation’s abundance should be used not as a tool of death but as a
lifeline for poor and struggling people at home and abroad.</p>
<p><strong>Not in Our Name</strong></p>
<p>In a time of stifling darkness, one bright light over the last weeks
has been the eruption of non-violent, pro-peace protests across the
world. In Africa, Asia, Latin America, and Europe, hundreds of thousands
of people have hit the streets to demand a ceasefire, including <a
href="https://x.com/PSCupdates/status/1718301978533515707?s=20">possibly
half a million people</a> in London. Here in the U.S., tens of thousands
of Americans have followed suit in dozens of cities, from New York to
Washington, D.C., Chicago to San Francisco. No less important, those
protest marches have been both multi-racial and multi-generational, much
like the 2020 uprisings for Breonna Taylor, <a
href="https://www.iwitnesssilwan.org/">George Floyd</a>, and the
countless other Black lives lost to police brutality.</p>
<p>Recently, close friends and colleagues sent me photos from a <a
href="https://www.jewishvoiceforpeace.org/2023/10/thousands-of-jews-and-allies-shut-down-capitol-hill/">march
in Washington</a> where <a
href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/19/jewish-activists-arrested-at-us-congress-sit-in-calling-for-gaza-ceasefire">Jewish
protesters</a> demanded a ceasefire and held up signs with heartrending
slogans like “Not in My Name,” “Ceasefire Now,” and “My Grief Is Not
Your Weapon.” Ultimately, close to 400 people, including numerous
rabbis, <a
href="https://www.commondreams.org/news/jewish-capitol-protest">were
arrested</a> as they peacefully sang and prayed in a congressional
office building, while David Friedman, ambassador to Israel under
President Trump, hatefully <a
href="https://twitter.com/DavidM_Friedman/status/1713289253369614742?s=20">tweeted</a>:
“Any American Jew attending this rally is not a Jew — yes I said it!”
Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia <a
href="https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/marjorie-taylor-greene-israel-hamas-war-protest-rcna121494">ludicrously
claimed</a> that they were leading an insurrection.</p>
<p>Two days later, my organization, the <a
href="http://www.kairoscenter.org/">Kairos Center</a> for Religions,
Rights, and Social Justice, cosponsored a pro-peace march that drew a
large crowd of Palestinians and Muslim-American families. At noon, about
500 protesters, a gorgeous, multicolored sea of humanity <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1fvwqouwb8">participated in the
Jumma call to prayer</a> in front of the U.S. Capitol. The following
week, folks co-organized a pray-in at New York Representative Hakeem
Jeffries’s office, using the phrase “ceasefire is the moral choice.”
Faith and movement leaders offered prayers from their various religious
traditions and displayed the names of people killed so far.</p>
<p>On October 27th, as Israel expanded its <a
href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/israel-hamas-war-gaza-civilian-deaths-un-says-possible-war-crimes/">ground
invasion</a> of Gaza, I joined thousands of people in Grand Central
Station to call for a #CeasefireNow, one of the <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/27/world/middleeast/grand-central-protest-nyc-israel-hamas-gaza.html">largest
demonstrations</a> in New York since this most recent conflict broke
out. Protests continued all week. And on <a
href="https://peoplesforum.org/events/national-march-on-washington-free-palestine/">November
4th</a>, there was a mass rally and march in Washington, D.C., to call
for an end to war and support the rights of Palestinians, with hundreds
of organizations bridging a diversity of views and voices to plead for
peace.</p>
<p>Those marches were an inspiring indication of the broad coalition of
Americans who desperately want to prevent genocide in Gaza and dream of
lasting peace and freedom in Israel/Palestine. At the lead are
Palestinians and Jews who refuse to be used as pawns and prop-pieces by
military hawks. Alongside them are many Americans all too aware that,
though they might not be directly affected by the nightmarish events now
unfolding in the Middle East, they are still implicated in the growing
violence there thanks to their tax dollars and the actions of our
government. Together, we are collectively crying out: “Not in Our
Name.”</p>
<p>Such marches undoubtedly represent the largest antiwar mobilization
since the invasion of Iraq in 2003 and are weaving together diverse
communities — young and old, Black, Brown, and White, Muslim, Jewish,
and Christian, poor and working-class — in a way that should prove
encouraging indeed for a growing peace movement. Right now, there are
new alliances and relationships being forged that will undoubtedly
endure for years to come.</p>
<p>Yes, this remains a small victory in what’s likely to prove a
terrifying global crisis, but it is a victory nonetheless.</p>
<p><strong>Roses Dressed in Black</strong></p>
<p>The last few weeks have resurrected traumatic memories for many Jews
and Palestinians globally — of the Holocaust, the Nakba, and the long
history of Islamophobia, anti-Arab hate, anti-Jewish violence, and
antisemitism. For many of us who are not Palestinian or Jewish, the
recent mass death and violence have also triggered our own painful
reckonings with the past.</p>
<p>I’m a descendant of Armenian genocide survivors. When I was a child
growing up in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, I heard hushed tales of death
marches, hunger, lack of water, barricaded roads, and harrowing escapes.
Those stories remain etched into my consciousness, a mournful
inheritance my dispossessed ancestors handed down.</p>
<p>My great-grandfather, Charles Ozun Artinian, fled his home in what is
now Turkey’s Seyhan River valley after the 1909 Adana Massacre in which
Ottoman militants killed 25,000 Armenian Christians. Part of his family
escaped over the Caucasus Mountains into Western Europe. They then
traveled halfway across the world to Argentina, because so many other
nations, including the United States, had closed their borders to
Armenian refugees and would only open them years later.</p>
<p>As he was fleeing Adana, Charles wrote a poem, one of the few
surviving long-form poems from the region at the time. It begins:</p>
<p><em>“In the Seyhan valley there rises a smoke</em></p>
<p><em>Roses dressed in black, month of April cried</em></p>
<p><em>Cries of sadness and mourning were heard everywhere</em></p>
<p><em>Broken hearted and sad, everybody cried…“</em></p>
<p>My family taught my siblings and me that although the genocide
against our people was carried out by the Ottoman Empire, it was made
possible by the complicity and indifference of the international
community, including the world’s richest and most powerful nations.
Right now, the smoke rising over Gaza is suffocating and every
additional hour the U.S. enables more bombs to fall and tanks to rumble,
more roses will be, as my great-grandfather put it, dressed in black.
Not only that, but with the detonation of each new American-made bomb,
the conditions for the long-term freedom and safety of both Israelis and
Palestinians are blasted ever more into rubble.</p>
<p>Let us honor the memories of our ancestors and finally learn the
lesson of their many stolen lives: “Not In Our Name!,” “Peace and
Justice for All!” and the pleas
from Gaza, including “Ceasefire Now!,” “End the Siege,” “Protect Medical
Facilities,” and “Gaza is Home!”</p>
