<p><strong>These Guidelines were written from February 1924 through
March 1925. Rudolf Steiner died on March 30, 1925</strong></p>
<p>Translated by Frank Thomas Smith</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li><p>The human being needs spiritual self-knowledge for inner peace.
He finds himself in his thinking, feeling and willing. He sees how
thinking, feeling and willing are dependent upon the natural human
being. Where health and illness are concerned, they must follow the
physical body in its strength and debilitation. Sleep extinguishes them.
Life’s experiences show how dependent spiritual experience is on the
physical body. One may therefore come to the conclusion that
self-knowledge is lost midst these everyday experiences. Then the
essential question arises: whether self-knowledge and therewith
certainty about the true self beyond ordinary experience, is even
possible. Anthroposophy wishes to answer this question based upon sound
spiritual experience. It is not based on mere opinion or belief, but on
experience of the spirit, which is as certain as the experience of the
body.</p></li>
<li><p>When we look at lifeless nature we find a world revealed in
coherent relationships. We investigate these relationships and find that
they are the functions of natural laws. But we also find that through
these laws lifeless nature unites with the earth as a whole. From this
unification of the lifeless with the earth, we can then proceed to a
contemplation of the plant-world. We see how the cosmos beyond the earth
sends the forces from outer space which extracts life from the lap of
the lifeless. We become aware of the essence in the living which
extracts from the mere earthly and manifests what works down upon the
earth from the distance of cosmic space. In the most insignificant plant
we become aware of the essence of the cosmic light beyond the earth,
just as a luminous object is reflected in the eye. By such enhanced
contemplation we can observe the difference between the
earthly/physical, which governs the lifeless, and the outer-
earthly/etheric, which acts in living things.</p></li>
<li><p>We find man as an ensouled spiritual being placed in this earthly
and outer-earthly world. As long as he is in the earthly element, which
contains the lifeless, he carries his physical body with him; when he
develops the forces which insert the living from the cosmos into the
earthly, he has an etheric or life-body. This contrast between the
earthly and the etheric has been completely overlooked by modern
thinking. For this reason, the most irrational views about the etheric
have ensued. Fear of losing one’s self in the fantastic has prevented
discussion of this contrast. Without consideration of this contrast,
however, no insight into Man and World is possible.</p></li>
<li><p>One can contemplate the nature of man insofar as it is revealed
by his physical and his etheric body. We find, however, that whatever is
revealed from these sources does not lead to consciousness, but remains
in the unconscious. Consciousness is not illuminated, but darkened when
the physical and etheric bodies’ activity is increased. Even fainting
spells can be the result of such increases in activity. Through such
observations we realize that something is active in the human
organization – and in animals as well – which is not the same as what is
active in the physical and etheric. It is not active when the physical
and the etheric elements are active through their own forces, but when
these cease their activity. We arrive thus at the concept of the astral
body.</p></li>
<li><p>The reality of the astral body is found when we advance from
meditation by the thinking which is stimulated from without to inner
contemplation. For this one must inwardly seize the thinking stimulated
from without and intensively experience it in the soul as such, without
relation to the outer world; and then, by means of the soul-strength
acquired by this seizing and experiencing, become aware of the fact that
inner organs of perception exist, which spiritually see where the animal
and human physical and the etheric bodies are bounded, in order that
consciousness can arise.</p></li>
<li><p>Consciousness does not arise through a continuation of those
activities which derive from the physical and etheric bodies; rather
both of these bodies must reach rock-bottom, or even below that, in
order to “make room” for consciousness. They are not the originators of
consciousness, but merely provide the platform on which the spirit must
stand in order to generate consciousness in earthly life. Just as man on
earth needs a platform on which to stand, the spirit needs the material
foundation of earth on which it can evolve. However, as a planet in
space does not need a ground under it in order to claim its place, so
the spirit – whose contemplation is not directed through the senses
towards the material, but by its own forces towards the spiritual – does
not need this material foundation in order to trigger its conscious
activity.</p></li>
<li><p>Self-consciousness, which summarizes itself in the “I”, alights
from consciousness. This happens when the physical and etheric bodies
are deconstructed by their own forces, thereby allowing the emergence of
the spiritual in man. The deconstruction of these bodies creates the
ground on which consciousness is born. Reconstruction must follow,
however, if the organism is not to be destroyed. Therefore, if for the
experience of consciousness deconstruction takes place the deconstructed
must be reconstructed. Self-consciousness lies in the perception of this
construction. One can follow this process by interior vision. One can
sense how the conscious is transformed into the self-conscious in that
one creates from one's self an afterimage of the merely conscious. The
consciousness possesses its own image in the organism vacated, as it
were, through deconstruction. It becomes self-consciousness when the
emptiness is re-filled from within. The being capable of this
fulfillment is experienced as “I”.</p></li>
<li><p>The reality of the “I” is found when inner contemplation – by
means of which the astral body is cognitively grasped – is developed
further and living thinking is permeated with the will in meditation. At
first one has devoted one’s self will-less to this thinking. Thereby one
has allowed a spiritual element to enter into this thinking, just as
color and sound enter the eye and the ear when perceived by the senses.
In this way, what one has passively been able to bring to life in
consciousness can be recreated by an act of will, and in this act of
will the perception of one’s own “I” is enabled.</p></li>
