<p><strong>I. Beyond Capitalism and Socialism</strong></p>
<p class="intro">Juancito is nine years old but looks six. He lives on the streets of
a Latin American city and lives by the laws of the streets. He is
already a criminal of sorts because begging is illegal and he is a
beggar. In a year or two he will graduate to petty thievery and then on
to violent crime. More than likely he will become a drug addict, thereby
making his own violent end at the hands of the police or disease
inevitable. Members of the middle and upper classes will shake their
heads at the depravity of the poor or in commiseration, consciously or
not will wish him good riddance and carry on as before. Juancito’s name
is legion; he can be found in virtually all regions of the world. He is
a victim of social injustice – a euphemism for greed.</p>
<p>Society is at a point in history where it must decide upon the path
it wishes to follow. A crossroads is usually thought of as an either-or
decision. One road goes in one direction, the other in a different
direction. Modern history has, in fact, drawn two apparently different
paths: Communism or Capitalism. One part of the world chose one of these
paths and came upon a dead-end, hurled itself forward and crashed into a
<strong>wall</strong>, aptly symbolized in Berlin, drenched in blood and
misery. The other part kept to its chosen path of Capitalism, only
slightly modified, and fought to defeat or at least contain the
hegemonic ambitions of the Soviets. The Communists lost and logic seems
to conclude that the other path was the correct one all along, and on
which the whole world must now tread. The danger of this conclusion lies
in the possibility that socialist criticism of Capitalism will only lead
to a repetition of the Communist or some other ideological experiment,
with similar and foreseeable disastrous consequences. The fact that
Communism has been found, in practice, to be worse than the evil it
wished to supplant, does not necessarily mean that its criticisms of
Capitalism are not, at least to a large extent, correct and that the
Juancitos of the world’s suffering is indeed the result of capitalist
indifference.</p>
<p>Capitalist theory is based on the belief in the goodness of greed.
This is no secret. The father of capitalist theory, <strong>Adam
Smith</strong>, said so in so many words. If capitalist man is allowed
to exert to the full his egoistic yearnings to accumulate money and
goods production will increase, society will be enriched and all will
benefit. Stated in this way, the axiom sounds so simplistic and
erroneous that one is astonished that so many passionately believe it
and try to practice it. Probably because it contains an element of
truth.</p>
<p>Another great Briton, <strong>Charles Darwin</strong>, had much to do
with humanity’s capitulation to the theory of greed as goodness.
Originally Darwinism applied only to the biological world: the origin of
species and the survival of the fittest. However, what he observed in
the plant and animal kingdoms was soon carried over, by others, into the
human social realm and became “Social Darwinism”. Both Smith and Darwin
were religious men and believed that the hand of God was behind the
observable phenomena in nature and in society. Adam Smith literally
described the “invisible hand” guiding free market activities, a concept
which was necessary to soothe his nineteenth century conscience. It was
also necessary to cushion the jolt to common sense, for how else is it
possible to accept the premise that such a complex activity as the
economic one can simply run by itself like a perpetual motion timepiece
when given the label “free market”. The invisible hand image has been
dropped in modern economic thinking, but the concept is the same when
vague “market forces” are alluded to.</p>
<p><strong>Karl Marx</strong> and his followers agreed that man is
egotistic (or anti-social), but believed that this was the result of
economic forces preying upon him from without. Given the opportunities
inherent in the “free” capitalist system, one class - the propertied -
would inevitably exploit the non-owners, the workers. Although
production would indeed increase, its fruits would not accrue to all,
but only to the owners. In fact, the workers would become even poorer
than they already were at the time he wrote - which was poor indeed -
until their condition became so intolerable that they would revolt, in a
necessarily bloody fashion, and take over society in the name of the
proletariat. But here Marx joins Smith and Darwin as a mystic: the
dictatorship of the proletariat (the state) will cure humanity of its
egotism and will itself eventually wither away, urged on, apparently, by
some other-worldly, invisible force. Reality has proved this to be
nonsense. Marx also predicted that under capitalism economic power would
be concentrated in few hands as the stronger capitalists absorbed the
weaker ones. When one considers that 70-80% of world industrial output
is accomplished by a dozen TNCs (transnational companies) it is hardly
possible to assert that the prediction is far off the mark.</p>
<p>Essentially, both points of view are right and wrong at the same
time, as all ideologies tend to be. Most will agree that man is
egotistic, but when this is carried over into social science and called
anti-social, the cries of outrage are immediately heard. “Man is a
social animal, needs love and warmth, etc”. I am inclined to agree with
Adam Smith in respect to the origin of this trait: that it is innate and
not wholly negative. Individual human behavior is purely social only
when the one strives exclusively for the wellbeing of the other. This,
however, is virtually impossible. Even Mother Teresa had to eat, and
every time she did so she consumed what another could not. This is of
course a grotesque example, but deliberately so. What I wish to point
out is that the satisfaction of one’s own needs deprives another, if
only to a minuscule extent, of that satisfaction. Yet we are obliged by
the nature of things to provide for our own needs and for those of our
children or we and they will no longer exist. In doing so we tend ignore
the needs of others, of those who are hungry. No moral criticism is
implied; no moral question is involved. It is only when the satisfaction
of one’s own needs also becomes the satisfaction of one’s own desires
does this behavior become effectively anti-social, for it is then often
necessary to exploit others in order to satisfy superfluous desires.</p>
<p>Another type of commonly observed behavior can be called asocial.
This is usually deemed to be negative, and is indeed so when someone
just doesn’t give a damn and refuses to get involved. However, the
desire to improve oneself through study or the need to get away for the
weekend now and then, or even meditation, are essentially asocial
behavior because they are done alone. They don’t do any harm, nor do
they help anyone except oneself.</p>
<p>To recapitulate, the three forces are:</p>
<p>* Social - acting for the benefit of others. Christ’s message, Love
thy neighbor as thyself, loses its meaning if it is understood to mean a
passive feeling towards others, even if that feeling is called love and
assuming that the lover knows what love is. Love must rather be
demonstrated through acts, or it is abstract.</p>
<p>* Asocial - acting for self-benefit, without affecting others.</p>
<p>* Anti-social - consciously or unconsciously acting against the
interests of others. The place where anti-social activity is most likely
to have grave negative effects is in the economic sphere, for it is here
that exploitation of the many by the few in fact takes place and is the
main cause of social unrest.</p>
<p>The central question is whether the egotistic forces in society can
be harnessed and their energy redirected towards social instead of
anti-social actions. If it is possible to demonstrate this, it would
indicate that the choices available are not only Capitalism or
Socialism, but that another alternative may exist. If such a third way
exists it must be found and acted upon.</p>
<p>A third way has, in fact, been described by <strong>Rudolf
Steiner</strong> in his book <em>Basic Issues of the Social Question<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></em> (<em>Kernpunkte der Sozialen
Frage</em> – 1919), in which he urges a “threefold” or tripartite social
structure. There is no question that the book is dated. The essential
concept is, however, valid.</p>
<p><strong>II. Is Slavery Really Dead?</strong></p>
<p>Roberto Cavallo leaves home at 5.30 a.m. in order to arrive at his
job by 7. He is employed in a small company, which manufactures gas
heaters, where he earns $500 per month. The country is Argentina, where
the cost of living is approximate to that of the United States. Of
course he and his family (two children) cannot live on his salary, so he
has a second job as a gardener and his wife works as a maid. He
considers himself lucky. The owners of the firm, two brothers in their
early forties, send their children to exclusive private schools, own
second country homes and vacation in Europe.</p>
<p>Slavery existed in civilized human society from the beginning of
recorded history until the middle of the nineteenth century, when it was
abolished in the United States, the last “civilized” country in which it
was officially condoned, not as the result of a humanitarian impulse,
but by means of a bloody civil war. To the Western mind, the fact that
slavery was condoned in ancient Rome, Arabia, Africa, even the United
States during its early period, is not particularly surprising. That the
most enlightened souls in ancient Greece also accepted it and found it
normal is, however, somehow shocking. How could Plato, Aristotle,
Socrates justify such an inhuman institution? That they did not bother
to justify it indicates that it was simply in the order of things and it
never occurred to them or anyone else to question it. This implies a
development of consciousness, for not even the reactionary elements
today would try to reinvent slavery. In the southern United States the
real reason for slavery was the economic need for free labor on the
plantations. The rationale was that the Africans were not quite human
and it was therefore legitimate to treat them as what they were thought
to be: animals. This was probably sincerely believed by many, if not the
majority. Even the Nazis needed a rationale for the murder of the Jews:
their racial inferiority, which was a danger for the purity of the
German nation.</p>
<p>Just as slavery was a natural condition for the ancients, a form of
modern slavery is natural for us: we do not question it. The modern form
of slavery deals in the buying and selling of human labor. Previously
the whole person, body and soul, was owned by another, was bought and
sold, abused or treated decently as animals still are, depending on the
whim of the owner. The slave was an object, no more than an intelligent
means of production. To what extent has this changed? It is no longer
possible to buy a whole person, at least not in the civilized part of
the world. If we compare the modern industrial worker and the former
agricultural slave, we find that freedom exists today for the former,
but only to a degree. If he doesn’t like his job he can quit and try to
find another. If he does, he will find that nothing has substantially
changed. He still sells his work to the highest bidder. The employer is
in the position of being able to buy (but not sell, except in
professional sports) an essential part of the human being: his work. If
this sounds at first glance exaggerated, observe the “labor market”, in
which the negotiations take place. Labor unions have the obligation to
obtain the highest possible price for the labor they represent, and
management attempts to buy the commodity as cheaply as possible.
Trans-national companies seek out countries where labor is cheapest in
order to invest in new plants. There is no question that labor has the
nature of a commodity, an object, an intelligent machine - still, under
the capitalist system.</p>
<p>The effect this has on the worker is profound. In under-developed
countries, where labor is exploited through low pay levels and miserable
working conditions, there is constant friction between labor and
ownership which often spills over into the political arena. Demagogues
or military interests take advantage of the misery experienced by the
lowest (working) levels of society – the majority – in order to seize
political power. They promise the workers much and usually deliver
nothing except more misery. In any case, the development of democratic
institutions is inevitably interrupted and set back for years. Hitler
and Mussolini, to name only the most extreme examples, were originally
the leaders of workers’ movements. Such demagogues are able to seize
power because they are supported by the masses. But even in economically
“advanced” countries, where workers are paid decent wages, labor
dissatisfaction is always prevalent as is evidenced by constant labor
union demands for more pay and benefits. These demands are made even
when wage scales and benefits are more then adequate. The results are
higher production costs and inflation.</p>
<p>We can curse the unions lack of responsibility until we are blue in
the face, or enact legislation which limits their influence, but it does
not help because neither rhetoric nor superficial legal measures get to
the heart of the matter. The fact that workers are forced to sell their
labor, thereby consolidating their semi-slave status, results in a
deeply felt sensation of being wronged, regardless of the amount of
remuneration received. Until this situation is recognized and corrected,
harmonious labor relations in industry will not be achieved.</p>
<p>The question is: how can this situation be corrected? History has
shown that turning ownership and control of industry over to the state
is a grave error. There is, however, an alternative. A look at the
reasons for the astonishing success of Japanese industry reveals a clue.
Japanese industrialists are no less capitalist than their western
counterparts, but they do something essentially different. Despite their
reputation for being an ant-like society, the reality is quite
different. Japanese industrial culture considers the worker to be a
human being - not a machine as in the west - and treats him accordingly.
Kaoru Ishikawa states this unequivocally in his revolutionary book “What
is Total Quality Control?” When workers are able to organize their own
work through institutions like Quality Circles and are fully informed
concerning the objectives and policies of the company they become
motivated. An organization with motivated co-workers will out-perform by
far one with unmotivated personnel. This does not mean that the Japanese
have solved the social problematic which began at the inception of the
industrial revolution, or that they have solved their enormous fiscal
problems. They have, however, taken a first, tentative, perhaps
unconscious step in the right direction. In their society industry is
still owned by anonymous shareholders as it is in the rest of capitalist
society. The problem of ownership of the means of production remains
unresolved. Their success, however, is certainly enhanced by the fact
that foreign competition has not been willing or able to take even that
first step, despite the fact that the philosophy behind the humanizing
of industry originated with western industrial psychologists such as
Douglas MacGregor and J.A.C. Brown.</p>
<p>Profit sharing is another baby step in the right direction.
Unfortunately, the percentage of profit shared is usually infinitesimal
and is therefore perceived by workers as being the cynical sop that it
is.</p>
<p>These two steps, worker participation in decision-making (which does
not mean control of the decision-making process, but only participation
in decisions which directly affect them and their work) and profit
sharing, can be grasped as already existing methods which could be
expanded to the extent that justice is achieved. If all workers,
including managers, are part owners of the company in which they work,
and if there are no other part owners, the semi-slave status of workers
would be eliminated. This is not Communism. I am not advocating that
industry should be turned over to the state which supposedly represents
the workers, but that it should be owned by all those who actively
participate in it, and only by those.</p>
<p>The obvious objection to this concept is based on a myth: the
necessity of stock markets. Capital is indeed raised by the sale of
company stocks in the market. But the main function of this market is a
speculative one. It is little more than respectable gambling, somewhat
safer than the racetrack or the roulette table at Las Vegas. It is the
forum in which the rich increase their capital without the necessity of
resorting to work. Other means of raising capital for production exist:
bank loans and bond issues. In both of these alternatives the lender may
reap a reasonable profit, but has neither a voice nor a vote in the
company’s policies. In other words, he is not an anonymous owner with
the capability of reaping profits for himself at the expense of those
who do the work. The conversion of anonymously owned companies to
worker-owned enterprises would be complex and would take time, but it
could be done with the necessary basis of corresponding laws, which
could be enacted by any democratic legislature not dominated by economic
interests.</p>
<p>Banks of course are also anonymously owned, profit oriented
enterprises. They should be required to convert to a special
non-profit-making status. Not that there would be no profit, but it
would be used only to cover the banks’ own costs and reinvestment
requirements. An important and immediate benefit deriving from such a
conversion would be lower interest rates due to the abrogation of the
need to pay dividends to stockholders. Dividends are, in reality, a
cost; hence, lower costs and the resultant lower interest rates, meaning
greater borrowing power for industry, which should more than offset the
lack of anonymous investment capital.</p>
<p><strong>III. Motivation and Reality</strong></p>
<p>“The well-being of a working community is that much greater the less
each individual claims of the proceeds of his efforts for himself; that
is, the more he cedes to his fellow workers, and the more his needs are
not satisfied by his own efforts but by the efforts of the others. All
activities within a community which contradict this law must, in the
long run, cause suffering and misery.” Rudolf Steiner<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>The above statement requires some reflection. Steiner called it a
social law, and compared it to a law of nature. Should it indeed have
the authority of a social law, much of the suffering and misery being
experienced in the world today can be understood as the result of this
law being contradicted in an extreme manner. Although tax systems
require us to cede a portion of the “proceeds of our efforts” to the
community, in the case of the rich as individuals and corporate
organizations it is a small portion and contributes little or nothing
towards the just distribution of wealth. Nor can it be taken for granted
that a graduated income tax system is intrinsically beneficial. It is no
secret that the wealth of the world is concentrated in the hands of very
few and that the majority of the human beings currently alive live
either in poverty or abject poverty. The capitalist prediction that an
increase in production will bring prosperity to all has been disproved
by reality, just as the Marxist prediction that a social utopia can be
obtained by the worker state expropriating the means of production
(capital) and administering it has been disproved by the same inexorable
judge. Although it is true that the populations of certain more favored
countries of the “first world” have benefited materially from increases
in production, it is also true that economic activities are no longer
national, but worldwide. Therefore while Switzerland and Sweden prosper,
Somalia and Guatemala suffer in inverse proportion.</p>
<p>The “mixed” economy, part state owned, part privately owned, seems
only to incorporate the worst of both systems. The state is eminently
incapable of operating economically viable enterprises. As governments
are obliged to reduce losses, the tendency is towards “privatization”,
thereby strengthening the capitalist system and increasing the size of
the gap between rich and poor.</p>
<p>The principal argument in favor of capitalism is motivation. The
entrepreneur (capitalist) is motivated by profit. The manager is
motivated by his high salary, the worker by whatever he earns plus fear
of losing his job.</p>
<p>An incident from my own work experience illustrates the absurdity of
this proposition. As manager of a branch office, I received a call one
day from my boss in head office. He informed me that he had received
instructions from the president of the company (who in turn was
instructed by the board of directors) to reduce management personnel in
his section by 25%. I was safe, he hastened to assure me, although my
heart had already jumped to my throat, but he had to decide immediately
which ten people would be let go. He wanted my opinion concerning his
shortlist. Although we were scattered around different cities of the
world, all the people concerned were, if not intimate friends, at least
friendly colleagues. I had no desire to share the boss’s anguish at
having to decide. A quick calculation of my income, which was far in
excess of my needs, reduced by 25%, led me to make what seemed to me to
be a logical suggestion. Why not ask everyone if they would voluntarily
take a 25% cut? The result in company saving would be practically the
same. This was, by the way, long before the concept of lean management
was introduced by necessity into corporate thinking. For us, the work
was there and we were already lean in relation to it. The reduction in
personnel was dictated by purely financial considerations and was
instigated by a new financial director anxious to make a name for
himself. There was a long pause at the other end of the line as my
superior calculated his own reduction. Then he said that he doubted the
idea would be accepted higher up, but that he would consult and let me
know. He called back the same day to inform me that my suggestion had
been seriously considered at the highest level, that my interest was
greatly appreciated, etc., but that the idea had been rejected. The
reason given was that a person was considered to be worth what he earned
and if we reduced management salaries it would mean that we were all
worth less, would be that much less motivated and our production would
be reduced accordingly. I told him that was absurd. He agreed, but
that’s the way it goes, everybody knows - to quote Leonard Cohen.</p>
<p>But what if motivation is not merely a function of money and greed?
What, then, is the true motivation? In order to know, it is necessary to
also know something of human psychology, not the psychology derived from
the study of the behavior of rats, but from the observation of human
beings outside the laboratory. If we believe that the human being is the
most developed animal, we are at a dead end and the carrot and stick
social Darwinists are right. But if man is more than that, if he has a
soul and spirit and is capable of acting from motives which exceed those
dictated by instinct, then we are obviously on the wrong track when we
suppose that he will react to the same stimuli as a laboratory guinea
pig. If some reader expects me now to “prove” that man has a soul and/or
spirit, I must disappoint. I cannot cite one single laboratory
experiment that provides such proof. Nor, however, can anyone prove the
contrary. Neither intelligence nor education can provide the answer, as
there are many very intelligent, educated people on both sides of the
question. If their training and intellectual capacities were decisive,
they would all agree, one way or the other, but they don’t.</p>
<p>Are we at an impasse? Not necessarily. In order to show why, I will
explain what I mean by “soul” and “spirit”. The soul is that part of the
human being which feels and is conscious. I see a beautiful landscape
with my eyes, but the pleasure it brings me is felt by my soul.
Inversely, the pain I feel at the sight of starving children is also a
function of my soul. That another might not feel pain, but pleasure, or
might even enjoy torturing another human being, merely indicates that
his soul has developed differently; has taken an abnormal, sub-human or
pathological path. Even the “physical” pain felt as the result of
receiving a blow is, in reality, felt by the soul. (When consciousness
is absent, there is no feeling.) Sensation and consciousness are shared
however, to a lesser degree, by the animals, and if our thesis is that
there is a fundamental difference between them and human beings, it is
necessary to define this difference. The spirit in this context is the
immortal “I”, or self, of each individual. This individual self not only
thinks, an attribute of man alone, but also intuits. Intuition is hard
to define and in any case has several meanings. Here I mean that
unconscious knowledge which dimly emerges into consciousness at
dispersed, short-lived intervals. It tells us that such things as soul
and spirit do exist and that life has a far greater meaning than we have
ever guessed. It is sparked by a chance encounter, a piece of music, a
poem, a book, a tree. For an instant we are different, we know, we
intuit; then it disappears like the flame of a candle blown out by
someone behind us. Motivation is a function of soul and spirit. At the
soul level, I want recognition, decent working conditions and pay, the
possibility to share in decisions and organize my own activities, a
friendly social atmosphere. The spirit is more demanding. It wants to
know the meaning of my activities, it wants responsibility towards
others. It wants to work for others more than for myself. That these
desires are unconscious does not make them less real, only more
difficult to realize.</p>
<p>This is an existential question. Some may agree that intuition tells
us that the above or something similar is true. Others may reject such
an assumption outright. But a third possibility also exists, along the
lines of Kierkegaard’s <em>Either/Or</em>. If my intuition tells me
nothing (or if I can’t hear it), I should weigh the consequences of
acting on the one hand as though it were not true and on the other as if
it were. If I act according to a rejection of the spiritual nature of
man I can, if I dedicate some thought to my situation, only end in
despair, for life has no meaning and death is the end of the road. But
if I act according to the hypothesis that I have a spiritual nature,
then that spirit is immortal and this has far-reaching consequences. It
could even result in the conviction that my Self is destined to
reincarnate on the earth in order to continue its development. In any
case, it means that life has meaning and each of us has a need to know,
or at least intuit this meaning. And it means that our neighbor also has
a spiritual nature and is striving for the same development as myself.
In this case, do I help him or do I exploit him?</p>
<p>If I want to help him and he is my subordinate in the workplace, I
must give him the opportunity to develop his Self and to take the first
steps along the path to freedom.</p>
<p>My motivation and my perception of the motivation of others change
radically. No longer is it possible to believe that motivation is
governed by self-aggrandizement. The real human motivational needs are
rather related to the need to help others. If this sounds like
hopelessly muddled idealism unrelated to reality, I suggest that we look
again at Steiner’s social “law” and try to envisage an expanded world
community in which this law applied. The wellbeing of all would
doubtless increase immeasurably. The objection that man is intrinsically
an egotist and would never be able to put such a law into practice
brings us back full circle. It must be tried before it is rejected.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The war between capitalism and communism
is over: capitalism won. The result is that we are right back where we
started from. Communism, as installed and dictatorially defended by the
Soviet Union, was essentially a reaction, followed by the violent
repression of capitalism and individualism. The world, however, is still
divided between those who have and those who have not. The Threefold
Society does not wish to destroy capitalism, but to radically reform it
by limiting its power. Some points: The economy would not be organized
by the state or, conversely, governed by the lie that it is “free”, to
wit: governed by corporate interests. It would be governed by
associations of producers, distributors and consumers, meaning that the
consumers’ interests would be defended by consumer representatives
rather than by the political state, which is incompetent to do so. The
political state would be limited to the defense of human civil rights.
It would not be involved in economic development or spiritual/cultural
affairs, especially not education. All have the right to life – having
sufficient basic income to live decently. Although wealth derives from
the economy, it is the duty of the state to insure that it is justly
distributed. The current Guaranteed Basic Income movement is moving in
this direction. Culture, society’s spiritual sector, especially
education, would be free of state control. This does not mean that the
state would not have to finance schools with the public’s tax money, but
only that educational institutions would be free to choose their own
educational methods.</p>
