<p class="intro">It’s one of those nights again where I can’t get any sleep. I’ve been
thinking about this lately and decided to use this time under the
disappointingly clouded night-sky to type it all down. Heeereeee it
goes:</p>
<p>I was re-introduced to esoterism at the age of 14. I say reintroduced
because I’m sure I’ve studied it before, in my past lives. I was raised
Protestant Christian (my mother’s influence on the household) in a
Catholic country, with a non-practicing Catholic father. I grew up
religious. I read a lot of fantasy books growing up, a lot of epic
novels. I played a lot of sports (still do so). I was a normal kid with
a happy, healthy life.</p>
<p>The shift came when my first boyfriend lent me a few of his books on
Metaphysics.</p>
<p>There was one fundamental idea in those books that changed the way I
looked at things, and it was this: There’s another reality beyond the
physical reality that we can approach in the form of ideas, and when we
engage with these ideas, new neural pathways are formed in the brain,
which in turn influences how we behave, which directly affects our
reality. In other words, our thoughts create our reality.</p>
<p>He also lent me a book called <em>The Kybalion: Hermetic
Philosophy</em> about the seven principles of existence. The Kybalion
was authored by the “Three Initiates” (whoever they are), and its seven
principles of existence are: </p>
<blockquote>
<ol type="1">
<li>Mentalism: The ALL is MIND—The Universe is mental.<br />
</li>
<li>Correspondence: As above, so below, as below so above. <br />
</li>
<li>Vibration: Nothing rests, everything moves, everything
vibrates. <br />
</li>
<li>Polarity: Everything is Dual; everything has poles; everything has
its pair of opposites; like and unlike are the same; opposites are
identical in nature, but different in degree; extremes meet, all truths
are but half-truths; all paradoxes may be reconciled. <br />
</li>
<li>Rhythm: Everything flows, all things rise and fall. <br />
</li>
<li>Cause and Effect: Every Cause has its Effect; every Effect has its
Cause; everything happens according to Law; Chance is but a name for Law
not recognized; there are many planes of causation, but nothing escapes
the Law.<br />
</li>
<li>Gender: Everything has its masculine and feminine principles, gender
manifests on ALL planes. </li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>I started viewing the world through the lens of these seven
principles of existence and saw that it was true—these are the laws of
reality.</p>
<p>About a year later, a friend invited me to a philosophical
organization with strong theosophical inclinations. It was in this
school that I was introduced to Madame Blavatsky. I read all of her
<em>Isis Unveiled</em>, which is a torrent of information. It was during
this time that I also started reading Plato and studying all different
kinds of religions.</p>
<p>A guy from this school was studying Blavatsky’s cosmogenesis (the
creation of the cosmos) from her <em>Secret Doctrine</em>. While doing
so he had come across some research regarding Anthropogenesis (the
creation of mankind) from an Austrian philosopher called Rudolf
Steiner.</p>
<p>This guy told me that Rudolf Steiner thought that before
understanding the creation of the world it was imperative that we
understand the creation of man, because the cosmos is so complex that we
cannot firmly grasp how it’s built before understanding ourselves first.
This, he told me, was only one of the many ideological differences
between Theosophy and Anthroposophy, the esoteric movement founded by
Rudolf Steiner… another main difference being that Rudolf Steiner
believed that man could become an initiate without necessarily having a
guru to guide him every step of the way.</p>
<p>I was intrigued, but not enough to start my own research on the
subject.</p>
<p>When I turned 17 I dropped out of the organization, mainly because I
felt it was infringing on my freedom and because I wasn’t willing to
accept their dogma. The guy who had introduced me to Rudolf Steiner also
dropped out because of ideological differences. I ended up marrying him
5 years later, actually. His name is Miguel (Michael in Spanish).</p>
<p>Around the time I turned 18, Miguel went on a business trip to
Argentina and came back with a present to me: the book <em>An Outline of
Occult Science</em> by Rudolf Steiner.</p>
<p>He wasn’t studying Anthroposophy, but he saw this book on his visit
to the library and was reminded of what he’d read about Steiner. He knew
that Occult Science was one of Steiner’s major works, and that I had
been talking a lot about human freedom and about the idea that we don’t
necessarily need a guru to become enlightened, that we could find out
the truth for ourselves. So Miguel bought it for me thinking I would
resonate with the material.</p>
<p>I read it… and it was dense. Even for me, who had read <em>Isis
Unveiled</em>. But from the little I understood, I knew something was
there. And I continued to be intrigued. Very intrigued. Here was an
occultist who was taking an entirely new approach to this kind of
knowledge, a western approach. I had studied so much eastern
spirituality that this was refreshing. This man was a scientist. He was
logical, not mystical.</p>
<p>I read some of Steiner’s other books, including <em>The Fifth
Gospel</em>, several times during the course of three years. I also read
some of his lectures.</p>
<p>The understanding of Steiner’s Fifth Gospel led to a profound and
very emotional return to Christianity for me, which I had abandoned at
14 when I first started studying esotericism and accepted all religions
as truth. In a way, Steiner helped me rediscover my faith. But even
though I admired him immensely as an occultist and I gave credit to his
work for my return to Christianity, I didn’t consider myself an
anthroposophist.</p>
<p>Then, quite accidentally, I stumbled upon a book in college that once
again changed things for me entirely. I was 21 years old at the
time.</p>
<p>I remember the class, Maritime Law. The professor was droning on and
on about things that were already in the textbook, so I zoned out and
started surfing the Internet with the campus’s free WiFi on my MAC while
pretending to take notes.</p>
<p>I went to amazon.com and typed ‘Rudolf Steiner’ in the search box,
and started scrolling. I saw a book with a pretty cool drawing, very
impressionist in my opinion, and I clicked on it.</p>
<p><em>How to Know Higher Worlds</em></p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>I googled the book. There was a free .pdf available. I started
reading immediately.</p>
<p>The book stirred a deep vocation in me for the Spirit. This was the
path! This is the manual, the guide. Finally I found it, a Path of
Initiation into the Mysteries that I could follow and also profoundly
understand.</p>
<p>And it was a noble path. The first chapter speaks of cultivating
Reverence, or deep admiration for everything that is true and good and
beautiful. Deep admiration for those powers and forces who are superior
to us and who seek to guide us into the truth. It also speaks of loving
your neighbor, of working for the world, of being of service to
others.</p>
<p>As I said, I am a kid who grew up on stories like Lord of the Rings
and Harry Potter, epic brave fantasy novels. This means I grew up aware
of the fight of good versus evil and of the importance of heroic,
virtuous acts. For me <em>How To Know Higher Worlds</em> is the path of
the JEDI.</p>
<p>If I liked Rudolf Steiner before, this book took it to a whole other
level. From that point on, I started downloading, buying, and reading
Steiner e-books on my amazon kindle e-reader. I basically read
everything on the market.</p>
<p>All of this led me to become an anthroposophist. Not suddenly, but
gradually, after prolonged thought and inner questioning about whether
this was the philosophy I wanted to follow the rest of my life. And it
was. I remember the day I declared it to myself: “I am an
anthroposophist”.</p>
<p>I have read HTKHW easily more than 15 times in the span of the last 4
years (I am 25 now). I pick it up and read through it about every four
months or so.</p>
<p>The book feels different every time I pick it up. Or I’m in a
different mood, or something. Sometimes I read new sections with an
expanded comprehension. Other times I unravel things I hadn’t
understood, or thought I understood but really didn’t. One time, even, I
read over an entire three pages of information that I had totally glazed
over before. And good information, too, about the etheric currents
surrounding our bodies and hands.</p>
<p>My relationship with this book keeps evolving. I follow the
exercises, but not perfectly. There’s a part in the book where Steiner
says that what matters isn’t that we’re perfect, but that we always have
the intention of striving towards the Spirit and of working on ourselves
honestly. That’s what I try to do, every day.</p>
<p>As for the clairvoyance?</p>
<p>Well, there’s another part in the book where it says that if we still
don’t understand what we’re seeing, then the less we try to define it to
ourselves or explain it to others, the better. That way we don’t form
judgments and our mind remains flexible for when we absorb more
information in the future, and start seeing the whole picture and are
able to understand it all.</p>
<p>Also, the desire for clairvoyance, to want to be clairvoyant just for
the sake of seeing stuff in the spiritual worlds, is a selfish desire
and the higher powers constantly retreat from it. In other words, the
more you want it, the more you’ll be denied it. You have to focus on the
exercises because you want to develop yourself and be of service to the
world. The clairvoyance is secondary.</p>
<p>As a hypothetical example, let’s say that I possess some form of
clairvoyance, however rudimentary or dim. If I admitted it publicly it
would serve little more than boasting, and the emotion behind this
boasting would be pride. As a result of this pride, the perception would
retreat. Perhaps for days, even weeks. That’s just how it works.</p>
<p>If I could condense the entire practical wisdom of this book in 4
exercises, they would be the following: </p>
<blockquote>
<ol type="1">
<li>OBSERVATION: Observe yourself and others. Detach yourself from your
opinions and study the world as objectively as possible. <br />
</li>
<li>MEDITATION: Retreat into the spiritual worlds. Make time in your day
where you separate the essential from the inessential, the
transcendental (Spirit) versus the untrascendental (Form). <br />
</li>
<li>CONTEMPLATION: Think about your actions, your feelings, and your
thoughts. Judge yourself fairly, from a third person perspective. If you
can’t judge yourself with honesty, how will you grow? <br />
</li>
<li>REVERENCE: Devotion to higher forces, concepts, principles, truths.
Continuous attention and focus on everything virtuous and worthy of
respect.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>There are also practical exercises like the observation of plants,
stones, animals, sounds, conversations, and human activity to develop
clairvoyant faculties, as well as an in-depth explanation of all of the
soul qualities necessary to develop the throat and heart chakras so that
they start rotating and we can actively participate in greater currents
of energy. The Buddha’s eightfold path actually fully develops one of
these two chakras, I can’t remember which.</p>
<p>In conclusion, How To Know Higher Worlds is not only my favorite
book, but also the one that has had the most impact in my life as a
spiritual seeker, and definitely the book that led me to declaring
myself an anthroposophist. It is the manual that I hope to continue to
use until the moment of my death, and I hope to absorb and interiorize
as many truths from it as possible to take with me to my next life.</p>
<p>I’m starting to realize other people don’t necessarily think the same
way I do. I know this sounds foolish, but it’s the truth. For example,
I’m starting to realize that maybe some people don’t even think about
their next lives, or what they want to take over from this life into the
next one. For some people the term ‘occultism’ might even cause
discomfort. Or pupilhood, or initiates or even mysteries.</p>
<p>Since I spent my entire adolescence familiarizing myself with these
terms, and also terms like guru, master and discipleship; terms taken
out of the traditional esoteric schools of wisdom that originated in
ancient times, these terms don’t cause me any kind of discomfort, but
I’m starting to emotionally understand that others might have different
approaches to this. So I ask you to please try to understand from my
point of view what it was like, just like I will try to understand
yours.</p>
<p>In contrast, Steiner’s whole approach to esotericism initially struck
me as very ‘laissez-faire’. But it was a difference that I quickly grew
to love as I became more aware of what initiation meant on the western
path. Just to illustrate -</p>
<p>This was my experience of the concept of initiation with
theosophy:</p>
<p>Teacher: The only path of initiation into the mysteries is through a
guru, through the path of discipleship. Blavatsky had her gurus, Koot
Hoomi and Lord Moria, and we have to work on ourselves and wait
patiently for a master to appear and lead the way.</p>
<p>This was my experience of the concept of initiation with
anthroposophy:</p>
<p>Steiner: Hey, girl. You’ve been reading through my stuff and I’ve
noticed you’re interested in the path of initiation into the mysteries.
Want some tools so you can get to know them yourself?</p>
<p>Me: Yeah! Cool!</p>
<p>Steiner: Okay. I’m going to tell you because you deserve it. But you
have to use this knowledge for good and not for selfish reasons. And I’m
not your master. I won’t ever tell you what to do, that’s up to you. But
I am your friend. (introduces How To Know Higher Worlds)</p>
<p>Me: Wow. Thanks, you rock.</p>
<p>And the book slowly started to change things. Which I will not go
into now.</p>
<p>As to my status as an ‘occult pupil’, or an active seeker of the
Spirit, or an aspirant to the mysteries, or an esoteric scholar, or a
JEDI, or you get what I’m saying… as to how I’m doing in THAT field…</p>
<p>I’m one of the kids in the back of the room getting into trouble
instead of focusing on the class, which is such a shame because I could
be an A+ student but instead I’m just scraping by with C’s. That’s my
status. And I’m okay with it, because hey, at least I know the material
well enough that I’m not flunking.</p>
<p>Now, I’m off to try to get some ZZZ’s. Good Night. ☺</p>
