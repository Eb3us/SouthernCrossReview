		<p class="intro">Taking my son to the Collegium Musicum<br>

		Is good for his musical future, no doubt;<br>

		For me it has advantages, too.<br>

		The hour and forty minutes spent<br>

		Waiting at the sidewalk cafe<br>

		Give me a chance to think in circles.</p>


		<p>The bow-tied black-vested waiter brings<br>

		my cafecito without me having to ask -<br>

		and sweet cookies or a media luna.<br>

		The unkempt park across the street,<br>

		The flower-printed tablecloths,<br>

		Sunglasses in winter, women in jeans,</p>


		<p>Newly privatized trains chug by,<br>

		The kiosco Revistas - Diarios,<br>

		Men smoking, uninhibited here.<br>

		I light my pipe, puff blissfully,<br>

		My thoughts arrange the past in pairs,<br>

		No avoiding that, the future less,</p>


		<p>suppressed. What's uppermost is now.<br>

		If life is all and this is happiness,<br>

		How on earth can death be less?<br>

		If life is all, then this is all<br>

		And death is all, it follows.<br>

		Such thoughts were once reserved</p>


		<p>For the philosopher's dreary den,<br>

		Here they stoop to invitations<br>

		From cafe idlers, now and then.</p>

<br>
		<p class="header-small">The First Circle</p>

		<p>A young woman passes my table,<br>

		A pretty thing whose long black hair<br>

		abruptly brushes down in style,<br>

		Shoulder bag, miniskirt, enigmatic smile.</p>


		<p>Fifty years from now she'll ask<br>

		why she did and what she didn’t,<br>

		and wonder what's become of her lover.<br>

		She'll also know it'll soon be over.</p>


		<p>Maybe centuries on from now<br>

		She'll pensive sit at some such table,<br>

		see me passing by and ponder<br>

		If I’m me and not some other.</p>

<br>
		<p class="header-small">The Second Circle</p>

		<p>The boy waits for the waiter to leave<br>

		Then darts across the noonday traffic.<br>

		Black street-wise eyes fix<br>

		On the patron's eye, bare arm extends<br>

		A stubby nail-bitten hand.<br>

		The sun-tanned man sees the hand,</p>


		<p>He shakes His leonine head - no.<br>

		Two women demure ignore the hand,<br>

		The eyes, the whole begging boy.<br>

		He comes to me. I've read too<br>

		That such as he are exploited by<br>

		Their runners and giving gives no joy.</p>


		<p>I don't know, it may be true,<br>

		but what is truth in ignorance?<br>

		I give him a peso anyway<br>

		in case some day the roles reverse<br>

		and I'll be he and he'll be me.<br>

		A circle is closed, the second of three.</p>

<br>
		<p class="header-small">The Third Circle</p>

		<p>The earth is round, more or less,<br>

		As are the heads upon our shoulders.<br>

		My coffee cup, from the bird's-eye view,<br>

		Is round and two-dimensional.<br>

		The universe seems to have acquired this time<br>

		The shape of an infinite bubble.</p>


		<p>Is this what makes the world go round?<br>

		No, it's not enough, this observed,<br>

		partly thought out rotundity.<br>

		The unexpected blow, the theft,<br>

		The unknown assassin's stealthy thrust,<br>

		The smiling traitor's perfidious lie.</p>


		<p>An imponderable enter the equation:<br>

		She rounds the corner and looks about<br>

		Like a lost child in a fairy fable<br>

		Then makes her way to my shaded table,<br>

		And takes her place across from me;<br>

		For love is an ellipse and One is Three.</p>
