<h3>And How Our Wars Distract Us</h3>

<main>
<p class="intro">Let’s admit it: We are indeed mad creatures.</p>
<p>This should truly have been the time of our discontent. The northern
hemisphere just experienced the <a
href="https://www.npr.org/2023/09/06/1197825362/this-summer-was-the-hottest-on-record-across-the-northern-hemisphere-the-u-n-say">hottest
summer</a> in recorded history, including month by month the warmest <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/21/climate/hottest-august-on-record.html">June,
July, August</a>, and (by a country mile) <a
href="https://time.com/6320831/september-global-temperature-record/">September</a>
ever. Staggering heat records <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/06/climate/climate-change-record-heat.html">were
set</a> in place after place globally. Fires from Canada to Hawaii to
Europe broke all records. (In fact, those Canadian summer fires are
now threatening to <a
href="https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/canadian-wildfires-could-keep-burning-through-winter-minister-2023-09-07/">burn
straight into</a> the winter months for the first time — and I fear this
phrase is going to be become all-too-boringly repetitive — in history.)
The <a
href="https://www.vox.com/climate/23864998/heat-wave-south-america-brazil-australia-argentina-hemisphere-winter">southern
hemisphere</a> had a “winter” from — yes! — hell. In Europe, which was
burning up, Greece <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/05/world/europe/greece-flooding-rain.html">experienced</a>
unprecedented fires and floods as well. Libya had a significant part of
a major city <a
href="https://apnews.com/article/climate-change-libya-flood-study-3eda9e77840d8bbd7058e494cc0a2231">washed
away</a>. China, too, experienced unprecedented flooding around its
capital, where <a
href="https://thehill.com/policy/international/china/564072-12-million-displaced-by-record-flooding-in-china/">1.2
million people</a> had to be evacuated, and in <a
href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/hong-kong-record-rainfall-flooding-black-storm-hits-rcna104025">Hong
Kong</a>, too. The sea ice in the Antarctic <a
href="https://apnews.com/article/antarctica-melting-ice-shelve-climate-change-1eb755e49cc229b04d4903567a51b6fc">fell</a>
to the <a
href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-66724246">lowest
levels</a> (yes again!) in recorded history, as did sea ice <a
href="https://www.statista.com/chart/19104/extend-of-arctic-sea-ice/">in
the Arctic</a>, helping to ensure a future in which rising sea levels
could flood coastal cities. And Greenland has been lending a hand to
that same future, starting 2023 with temperatures unmatched in <a
href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/18/world/greenland-ice-sheet-warming-climate/index.html">at
least 1,000 years</a> and still setting <a
href="https://www.climate.gov/news-features/event-tracker/new-record-temperature-southwest-greenland">new
temperature records</a> in July. Worse yet, that’s just to begin down a
list that increasingly seems unending.</p>
<p><span id="anchor"></span>In certain parts of my own country, the
United States, this summer was all too literally a hell on Earth and, as
a <em>New York Times</em> piece <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/05/us/summer-climate-change.html">headlined
it</a> recently, also “A Summer Preview of the Future; Floods, Fires,
and Stifling Heat.” (Its first line: “It felt like the opening minutes
of a disaster movie.”) A stunning heat wave, for instance, stretched
across a drought-stricken Southwest all the way to California, while
Phoenix, Arizona, hit an almost unbelievable temperature record of <a
href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/phoenix-hit-110-degrees-on-54-days-in-2023-setting-another-heat-record">54
days</a> of 110-degree heat or higher! (Oh, wait, make that <a
href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/phoenix-weather/2023/09/10/phoenix-hits-new-record-55-days-of-110-plus-temperatures/70818380007/">55</a>!)</p>
<p>And that, of course, was just to begin down a seemingly endless list.
I haven’t even mentioned <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/12/climate/mount-rainier-glaciers-climate-change.html">disappearing
mountain glaciers</a> or the soaring temperatures of South Asia or the
Middle East. (Iran hit a <a
href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2023/08/09/iran-persian-gulf-extreme-heat/">record
heat index</a> temperature of 158 degrees in August.) But let me stop
there. It isn’t hard to see that, if we humans continue to use
staggering amounts of fossil fuels and so pour ever more greenhouse
gasses into the atmosphere — and the latest study <a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/08/global-greenhouse-gas-emissions-at-all-time-high-study-finds">indicates</a>
that they are heading in that direction at record levels — the Earth, or
at least life as we humans have known it on this planet, will, in the
long run, almost literally go down in… what else?… flames.</p>

<p>No, it’s not that nothing is being done. Non-carbon-producing forms
of energy are indeed on the rise globally (<a
href="https://www.texasmonthly.com/news-politics/texas-number-one-in-renewable-and-nonrenewable-energy/">even
in</a> an oil heartland like Texas). Still, to take one example, China,
the country moving most dramatically to create ever more green power, is
also <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/03/business/energy-environment/china-coal-natural-gas.html">burning
more coal</a> than the rest of the planet combined and still planning to
up its use of that devastating source of energy. And keep in mind that,
these days, the <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/19/climate/us-china-climate-issues.html">two
greatest</a> greenhouse-gas-producing nations, China and the United
States (which is also cumulatively by far the greatest in history), have
in recent years hardly been able to exchange a civil word, no less
collaborate to try to make this planet a cooler, better place. At the
moment, it seems as if they stand a far greater chance of <a
href="https://tomdispatch.com/swarms-vs-swarms/">going to war</a> with
each other (while incinerating yet more fossil fuels and so much else in
the process) than allying to help save the planet as we know it.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, of course, the giant fossil-fuel companies have been
making — I know this sounds like a broken record but what can I do? — <a
href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/big-oil-doubles-profits-blockbuster-2022-2023-02-08/">record</a>
(oops, sorry!) profits. And keep in mind that, in the United States, the
leaders of one of the two major political parties are wildly focused on
supporting and <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/20/us/politics/desantis-climate-energy-biden.html">expanding</a>
Big Oil and carbon-producing energy sources of every kind, while <a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/28/ron-desantis-climate-crisis-campaign">denying</a>
that much of anything I’ve described above is actually happening. Worse
yet, according to the latest polls, their unofficial leader, Donald
Trump, stands a rather chilling (or do I mean boiling?) <a
href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/these-new-poll-numbers-show-why-biden-and-trump-are-stuck-in-a-2024-dead-heat">chance</a>
of retaking the presidency in 2024 and controlling the government for at
least four more wildly unpredictable, possibly ever more authoritarian
years of carbon hell. Under the circumstances, you might indeed be able
to kiss this planet goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>War Is Us</strong></p>
<p>And worse yet, with our increasingly dire global situation in mind,
ask yourself this: How is humanity reacting to the deep dangers we now
face? Are we focusing our attention on putting out the flames, so to
speak? I’m afraid — despite the <a
href="https://www.sunrisemovement.org/">heroic efforts</a> of any number
of young people — the overall answer would have to be: Not on your life!
Sadly enough, instead of facing the crisis of climate change head-on,
much of humanity seems all too intent on starting fires of the kind that
have defined us since time immemorial. I have in mind, of course, a
different kind of planetary destruction entirely: war-making. In fact,
sometimes that seems to be by far our greatest, if grimmest, skill and
deepest nature.</p>
<p>At a moment when peace couldn’t be more needed so that we could focus
on our imperiled future, war (and the threat of ever more of it) seems
once again to be what we’re all too willing to put at the very heart of
things, including of our news reports.</p>
<p>Consider war, in fact, our other version of burning the planet up.
Once upon a time, that would simply have been a metaphor for destructive
war after war after war throughout human history, but no longer. After
all, as anyone who saw the hit film <em>Oppenheimer </em>knows, back in
1945, this country first figured out how to create a global fire that
could, unlike climate change, consume our world in essentially no time
flat. I’m thinking, of course, of nuclear weapons, and of the fact that
their power to broil us (as well as, all too ironically, drive us into a
potentially devastating <a
href="https://www.science.org/content/article/nuclear-war-would-cause-yearslong-global-famine">nuclear
winter</a>) has only increased immeasurably with time. The weapons in
nuclear arsenals now are generally vastly much more powerful than those
two atomic bombs that decimated the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on
August 6th and 9th of that year.</p>
<p>Almost 80 years later, <a
href="https://www.ucsusa.org/nuclear-weapons/worldwide">nine
countries</a> have nuclear weapons and the U.S. is planning, in the
decades to come, to put <a
href="https://www.businessinsider.com/nuclear-modernization-plans-are-unnecessarily-costly-and-risky-2021-7">up
to $2 trillion</a> into “modernizing” its own nuclear arsenal, with the
<a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/19/us/politics/china-nuclear-weapons-russia-arms-treaties.html">Russians
and Chinese</a> following suit. Worse yet, lurking behind the most
recent full-scale war on planet Earth, the one in Ukraine, has been <a
href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/31/europe/medvedev-russia-nuclear-weapons-intl-hnk/index.html">the
possibility</a> that such weaponry could actually be used on a
battlefield for the first time since 1945. I’m talking, of course, about
“tactical nuclear weapons” — some far more powerful than the atomic
bombs that took out Hiroshima and Nagasaki — and the Russian president’s
<a
href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/putin-nuclear-weapons-threat-real-biden-warns-rcna90114">implicit
threats</a> to use them.</p>
<p>And that bloody disaster of a conflict, launched with Vladimir
Putin’s invasion in February 2022, has now become a full-scale, World
War I-style trench war (with the addition of course of so many modern
advances like drones) that shows no sign of ending in any imaginable
future. And if that war — and other conflicts, in places ranging from <a
href="https://tomdispatch.com/suffering-in-the-shadows/">Sudan</a> to <a
href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/17/talibans-ties-with-pakistan-fraying-amid-mounting-security-concerns">Pakistan</a>
— weren’t enough for you, then how about the now-ongoing Hamas-Israeli
nightmare in the Middle East?</p>
<p><em>Yes, in its surprise assault on Israel, Hamas brutally
slaughtered young </em><a
href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-gaza-hamas-music-festival-6a55aae2375944f10ecc4c52d05f2ffe"><em>music
festival attendees</em></a><em> in startling numbers and an unnerving
number of </em><a
href="https://www.reuters.com/world/nato-ministers-shown-horrific-video-hamas-attack-2023-10-12/"><em>children</em></a><em>
as well, while Israel is now mercilessly battering Gaza with its trapped
two million inhabitants (</em><a
href="https://www.insider.com/children-rights-gaza-palestine-israel-human-rights-united-nations-2023-10"><em>almost
half of them</em></a><em> children), </em><a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/10/world/middleeast/gaza-israel-airstrikes.html"><em>hitting</em></a><em>
schools, hospitals, and mosques, while cutting off electricity and food
which, as Senator Bernie Sanders </em><a
href="https://www.sanders.senate.gov/press-releases/news-sanders-statement-on-continuing-violence-in-israel-and-gaza/"><em>noted
recently</em></a><em>, is a “serious violation of international
law.”</em></p>
<p>No less grimly important, that disastrous struggle has become a focus
of almost all the news shows in a way that would be inconceivable for
the long-term danger of climate change. And no one yet knows how that
conflict might still develop or spread, but consider it symbolic of so
much else that, in response to the initial Hamas surprise attacks, the
Biden administration’s idea of restoring peace in a wildly
conflict-ridden Middle East was to <a
href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/2023/10/u-s-may-send-second-aircraft-carrier-toward-israel-00120793">send
in</a> an aircraft carrier task force and fighter planes. I mean, what
else could we do?</p>
<p>And mind you, even when we’re not at war, the U.S. and other
countries remain all too ready to invest so much more of our wealth in
our militaries than in tamping down climate change. Yes, give Joe Biden
some credit, he did oversee the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act,
which over time will put <a
href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/08/16/biden-ira-climate-law-anniversary-00111471">several
hundred billion dollars</a> into developing a climate-change-ready
economy.</p>
<p>Still, that could be his only major climate initiative and investment
(thanks significantly to a Republican House) in his four years in
office, while every year he’s president the American military has gotten
or will get a budget of <a
href="https://tomdispatch.com/the-ultimate-all-american-slush-fund/">more
than $800 billion</a> (and still rising toward the trillion-dollar
mark). Similarly, when aiding allies, as with Ukraine, we’re far more
likely to give them billions of dollars for armaments and other kinds of
militarized help <a
href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/how-much-aid-the-u-s-has-sent-to-ukraine-in-6-charts">($75
billion</a> in the case of Ukraine) than to aid them in battling the
growing nightmares of global warming.</p>
<p><strong>Will Humanity Go Asteroidal?</strong></p>
<p>You could say that, historically speaking, as well as in the present
moment, war has been both humanity’s foremost talent and our obsession,
and that we are, in some basic sense, mad creatures. War still remains a
deep and endless part of our world. Making war, in some sense, could be
considered our thing. I myself was born in the midst of the second
devastating global war of the last century and I’ve lived through
American wars in Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan, and Iraq (twice), as well
as that endless war on terror.</p>
<p>So, this is us. But here’s what’s different in this moment: while we
humans prepare for and all too regularly launch wars, this planet is now
visibly making war on us. Global warming is, in some fashion, a
slow-motion but increasingly horrifying assault on this planet as
humanity has known it these last thousands of years.</p>
<p>Or rather, if you want to think of it this way, humanity is now
making war on itself, using fossil fuels as its slow-motion weapon of
long-term atmospheric devastation, while distracting itself with more
localized wars on this planet. And thanks to that, it has no longer
become totally absurd to talk about our possible extinction. In a sense,
you might say that, with our own special form of brilliance, humanity
has managed to create both a devastatingly fast and a spectacularly slow
way of doing ourselves (and so much else) in. I’m talking, of course,
about those nuclear weapons and climate change. And thanks at least in
part to our inability to stop fighting wars among ourselves, we seem to
be ensuring that climate change won’t be the full-scale focus of our
attention as it should be.</p>
<p>So, think of those nukes and climate change as fast and slow-motion
versions of <a
href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2022/10/19/tsunami-dinosaur-meteor-extinction-waves/">that
asteroid</a> that took out the dinosaurs and so much other life on Earth
66 million years ago.</p>
<p>At least, however, T-Rex and its pals weren’t responsible for the
force that made them history. If things don’t change on this planet in
the decades to come, the same might not be true of humanity. You would,
in fact, have to say that we might have created our own asteroid, sent
it on a devastating slow-motion path to Earth, and then (to make matters
worse) largely ignored its coming and began killing each other
first.</p>
<p>Consider all of this, then, the deepest form of human madness and
just hope that somehow, from the Middle East to Ukraine, Beijing to
Washington, we can wake up to what we’re doing to ourselves before it’s
too late.</p>
