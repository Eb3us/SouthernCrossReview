<p>Seraphim was born in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaffa">Jaffa</a> (now part of Tel
Aviv, Israel) in 1934, and was among the first waves of displaced
Palestinian refugees to move to Beirut, Lebanon in 1952. She was 14 when
her family fled first to Sidon by boat in 1949. After their move to <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beirut">Beirut</a>, she worked in
refugee relief while attending art classes.</p>
<p>Whereas her Lebanese contemporaries often take on a figurative style
in order to demonstrate the central issues of the Palestinian struggle,
Seraphimâ€™s visual language is characterized as having complex layers of
overlapping lines and improvisational dream-like imagery. In this way,
Seraphim cultivates a shifting reality of infinite depth and creation.
Her dream-like imagery also implies the unsteady nature of a long-held
memory of a cherished place - and in doing so she transcribes her
political concerns regarding her home through the lens of personal and
surreal imagery while also encouraging the viewer to actively
participate with the imagery presented. When asked, Seraphim cites the
source of her surrealist imagery as memories of her childhood. She drew
specific inspiration from the faded frescoes of winged beings on the
ceiling of her grandfather's home, and former convent, in Jerusalem.</p>
