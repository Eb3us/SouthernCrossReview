<main>
<p class="intro">A ‘quantum’ revolution has taken place in the science of physics, we
see it written about and discussed everywhere today. It is the focus of
many popular works, like Gary Zukav’s The Dancing Wu Li Masters, and
Amit Goswami’s The Self-Aware Universe, to name only two. Zukav summed
up what has changed in these words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Today, particle accelerators, bubble chambers, and computer
printouts are giving birth to another world view. This worldview is as
different from the worldview at the beginning of this [20th] century as
the Copernican worldview was from its predecessors. It calls upon us to
relinquish many of our close-clutched ideas. In this world view there is
no [physical] substance.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Zukav also cites Heisenberg’s comments on how difficult it really is
for us to relinquish old ideas:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“….when new groups of phenomena compel changes in the pattern of
thought…even the most eminent of physicists find immense difficulties.
For the demand for change in the thought pattern may engender the
feeling that the ground is to be pulled from under one’s feet… I believe
that the difficulties at this point can hardly be overestimated. Once
one has experienced the desperation with which clever and conciliatory
men of science react to demand for a change in the thought pattern, one
can only be amazed that such revolutions in science have actually been
possible at all.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interesting yes, but what has this to do with Darwinism? The quantum
revolution has largely been limited to physics, and even though it now
claims, as was stated by Sir Arthur Eddington, that “The stuff of the
world is mind-stuff” and that ‘Consciousness’ lies at the root of all
physical phenomena, this has done little to influence biology. The
Darwinian and neo-Darwinian theories still insist that Consciousness
plays no role whatever in shaping the organic world, which it has long
argued is primarily the product of chance. My task here will be to
suggest that a similar revolution is overdue in biology, and that when
it comes it will not challenge evolution itself, but will throw very
serious doubt on Darwin’s account of how it all happened; it will not be
a religious argument.</p>
<p>To begin with it must be admitted that Darwinism is a nineteenth
century worldview, and that while twentieth century discoveries in the
realm of DNA have seemed, on the surface at least, to support that
worldview, they are themselves gradually becoming suspect for their
adherence to the “central dogma of genetics.” Which is “the view that an
organism’s genome — its total complement of DNA — should fully account
for its characteristic assemblage of inherited traits.” This dogma was
strongly argued against by the octogenarian scientist Barry Commoner in
the article <em>Unravelling the Myth of DNA</em>, published in Harper’s
Magazine in Feb 2002. He writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Why, then, has the central dogma continued to stand? To some degree
the theory has been protected from criticism by a device more common to
religion than science: dissent, or merely the discovery of a discordant
fact, is a punishable offence, a heresy that might easily lead to
professional ostracism. Much of this bias can be attributed to
institutional inertia, a failure of rigor, but there are other, more
insidious, reasons why molecular geneticists might be satisfied with the
status quo; the central dogma has given them such a satisfying,
seductively simplistic explanation of heredity that it seemed
sacrilegious to entertain doubts. The central dogma was simply too good
not to be true”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The same thing may be said of the Darwinian theory. It is held in
place by a kind of scientific lethargy, by the “seductive simplicity” of
its proffered solution, and by an all but complete failure to think
through the theory’s inner logic, as I will now demonstrate.</p>
<h4>Substance</h4>
<p>Darwinism is the principal survivor today of the old ‘mechanistic’
world view that we associate with Newtonian physics, that which was
displaced first by Albert Einstein’s relativity theory, and then even
more completely by the quantum revolution. So we may legitimately ask,
why does it still survive in biology? In Darwin’s worldview there still
is physical ‘substance.’ In fact apart from chance that is all that
there is in the theory, and words, of course, lots and lots of words —
wherein lies the cause of his many errors in logic. It is not whether or
not evolution has occurred that is open to question, the evidence for
that is indeed overwhelming, but Darwin’s explanation of how it all
happened is quite another matter; here there are unresolved rational
issues of such profundity that the reputation of modern science is
called into serous disrepute by it, and it all started with one
close-clutched idea, with the single word “mechanism”.</p>
<h4>Mechanism</h4>
<p>Etymologically speaking, the word ‘mechanism’ has a long history,
going back into the ancient Greek. Today it is normally used to describe
some contrivance or device created by human ingenuity to perform a
specific function or purpose. How well it performs that function depends
upon how well it was designed; a poorly designed machine will either not
do what is expected of it, or it will quickly breakdown, i.e. physically
fail. The word ‘design’ in normal usage, therefore, includes the concept
of a ‘purpose’ that the design was intended to fill; all of which tells
us that the word ‘mechanism’ denotes a human idea.</p>
<p>The first to attribute the idea of ‘mechanism’ to nature itself was
the French philosopher Rene Descartes (1596-1650), who postulated that
the created world evidenced a top-down split between two principles, the
upper part being Mind, or God, and the lower part being body, or
mechanism; the upper part being responsible for ‘designing’ and creating
the lower part. For a while this concept prevailed, and natural
philosophy at the time of Newton and beyond was unabashedly religious
and mechanistic. Gradually however, the top part of Descartes’ equation
weakened and eventually, with the coming of the Darwinian theory, it
vanished altogether. God the Designer, it was claimed, was now an
“unnecessary hypothesis”. Even for Darwin himself, however, disposing of
God was a very slow process. In an early (1845) version of his theory,
the activity of Natural Selection was attributed to the work of a “great
being”, but by 1859 the great being had disappeared and Natural
Selection went on to do its work alone. Some have speculated that the
death of his twelve-year-old favourite daughter, Annie, had turned
Darwin against God, but doubtless he had also come to understand that
science did not want a ‘great being’ in its theory. It wanted instead to
completely free itself of religion, which is what has since happened —
but at considerable cost to the idea of there being a higher than
individual purpose to human existence.</p>
<p>The absence of a Designer, however, created a logical dilemma that
worried Darwin, and he dealt with it in this short passage from
Origins:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“In the literal sense of the word, no doubt, Natural Selection is a
false term; but who ever objected to chemists speaking of the elective
affinities of the various elements? – and yet an acid cannot strictly be
said to elect the base with which it in preference combines. . . .
Everyone knows what is meant and is implied by such metaphorical
expressions; and they are almost necessary for brevity.” (1876 ed.,
66)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, the chemists that Darwin refers to, were not using metaphor
in an attempt to dislodge the Designer God from nature, and so to deny
the existence of divine Ideas in nature. Quite the opposite in fact.
They still believed in a Designer God, so for them no problem in causal
logic was created, such as what had arisen for Darwin himself, although
he barely noticed it. It is indeed subtle, yet a more total
contradiction will not be found in all of logic. Having excused himself
in this way however, he does not revisit the problem, but feels free to
ignore it. He then goes on to make copious use of such language
throughout his theory, as the following passage demonstrates:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It may be metaphorically said that Natural Selection is daily and
hourly scrutinizing, throughout the world, the slightest variations;
rejecting those that are bad, and adding up all that are good; silently
and insensibly working whenever and wherever opportunity offers, at the
improvement of each organic being.” (1876 ed., 68-69)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here he warns us in advance that he is using metaphor, but this does
not change the logical dilemma that the use of such language inevitably
creates. And this same language is scattered throughout his theory, so
much so that Stanley Edgar Hyman, in his book The Tangled Bank,
writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Darwin starts by insisting that nature is not a goddess but a
metaphor. As soon as he begins to talk about nature, however, she is
transformed into a female divinity with consciousness and will.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Henry Gee, Senior Editor for the science periodical Nature, in an
article on “concepts” in the December 2002 issue(Vol. 420, p 611),
argued that any concept of ‘progress’ used in relation to Darwinian
evolution must be viewed as invalid, because a theory based upon chance
simply does not support that concept. He tells us that the irrational
concept of evolutionary progress exists widely, even among scientists,
which he attributes to a romanticism that lies deeply rooted in nature
philosophy, adding: “Perhaps there is a Nature Philosopher in all of
us.” Undoubtedly he is right, but he was concentrating only on the
conflict between the concept of chance and the idea of progress, of
evolutionary “improvement” — what about all the rest of Darwin’s
metaphors?</p>
<p>This is the problem that I wish to draw attention to here, because
eventually the entire validity of Darwin’s theory must hang upon it.
Since his day, proponents of his theory have made the same frequent use
of metaphor, of what is termed ‘intentional’ or ‘volitional’ language;
language that suggests the workings in nature of a human-like
consciousness. Writers like Stephen J. Gould, Daniel Dennett and Richard
Dawkins argue that this is merely a ‘convention’ established by Darwin
himself and so fully acceptable in science. Dennett goes even further in
his book The Intentional Stance; he claims that Darwinists only use this
language “as if” it were true, while knowing all the time that it is
not. What would we think of a logician who claimed that in defending
thesis ‘A’ (scientific materialism) he is justified in using the
principal arguments from its antithesis ‘B’ (spiritual and mental
causes) because otherwise he cannot prove the truth of ‘A’? I suspect we
would want to send him back to school in a hurry to study basic logic.
But this is only the beginning of the problem.</p>
<h4>Mechanical Breakdown</h4>
<p>There are two ways in which a failure may occur in nature, one
involves the cessation of a physical process, as when a chemical
reaction reaches completion, or a stream dries up, or a star passes
through the many stages in the cycle of its existence. This is the kind
of ‘failure’ that we expect to find in physics, in the inorganic realm,
and it is fully explainable in terms of the workings of ‘natural
law’.</p>
<p>In biology, however, we are confronted with a different kind of
failure; that of an organism which sickens or dies or otherwise
malfunctions. The concept of physical cessation cannot explain this,
except marginally in cases of starvation, but even there it leads to a
breakdown in the organism’s functioning parts, like hearts, brains or
lungs. Illness and death then are failures of quite a different sort.
They are of the kind that we normally associate with the breakdown of a
mechanism. But you will recall that ‘mechanism’ is a human idea
involving a human designer, and that Descartes was only able to
attribute this idea to nature because he had included God the Designer
in his plan. When science took God out of the equation, as was the case
in the final version of Darwin’s theory, then all of the language of
design ought to have gone out with Him. It did not, because without it
the Darwinian theory just could not be seen to work. Instead we
enshrined the word ‘mechanism’ as a dictionary definition of scientific
materialism, and continued on as if there was nothing wrong with what we
were doing; but there was, and very much so.</p>
<p>Cornell University Professor William Provine puts the resulting
thought pattern this way:</p>
<blockquote style="font-style:italic">
<p>Modern science directly implies that the world is organized in
accordance with mechanistic principles. There are no purposive
principles whatever in nature. There are no gods and no designing forces
that are rationally detectable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The problem here, of course, is that “mechanistic principles” are the
principles that govern the construction of purposeful machines, and so
they are inseparable in our minds both from the ‘idea’ of a machine, and
from the concept of ‘purpose’. And to suggest that they exist in the
natural world without either ‘purpose’ or ‘Ideas,’ just makes no
rational sense, our minds are just being played with. Such principles
could only meaningfully exist in nature in conjunction with both
purposes and Ideas, but the Darwinian theory needs us not to notice
this. It needs both functionality and purpose in nature, but it needs
them, as it were, in disguise, because it cannot admit that nature
contains real ‘purposes’ and real ‘Ideas.’ For then the question will
arise, whose ideas? Not human ideas to be sure, we did not create the
natural world, but the fact that the theory makes use of human ideas in
order to appear even credible begins to look very suspicious indeed. It
appears that we have made use of the word ‘mechanism,’ and of almost the
entire sub-set of intentional words in language, to unconsciously
smuggle human ideas into nature in place of the divine Ideas that we
want to get rid of, because without ideas of some sort nature at the
organic level just cannot be made to either function or fail. But it
does function and fail, which means that the idea of ‘mechanism,’ or its
organic and purposeful equivalent, must actually be present in nature.
There is no way around it, the word or idea ‘mechanism’ will not help,
except marginally perhaps in our own minds. It has to be there in
nature, and it cannot be there without purposes and Ideas. Just as
without a Consciousness present in nature itself there can be no
legitimate use of words like ‘selection.’ Putting the word ‘natural’ in
front of ‘selection’ in no way alters this, the word still retains its
intentional meaning and the theory needs it to retain it, but it cannot
admit this or it would all be over.</p>
<p>In this light, consider the following widely circulated comparison,
attributed to A.G. Cairns-Smith, which I think everyone will agree makes
apples and oranges look like child’s play:</p>
<blockquote style="font-style:italic">
<p>A machine is explained in terms of physics and chemistry plus (at
least) an engineer.</p>
<p>An organism is explained in terms of physics and chemistry plus (at
least) evolution through natural selection.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The purpose of this comparison seems to be to equate a human engineer
with Natural Selection, and thereby to transfer to nature, in the mind
of the reader at least, the creative ideas of an engineer. In this way a
supposedly mindless nature, thought of as being void of all Ideas of its
own, is illegitimately given the mind and ideas of a trained engineer—a
transfer that completely negates the comparison being attempted. Were
nature not mindless it would have those creative Ideas in it anyway, and
far greater ones besides, and so it would not need to surreptitiously
borrow them from any human engineer. This kind of thinking, wherever it
appears in relation to evolution, represents an abject failure to
observe the simple rules of logic, the very last thing that science
should be guilty of.</p>
<p>This is the effect that the use of intentional idioms in the
Darwinian theory always creates. The theory attempts to deny the
presence of divine Ideas in nature by putting human ideas in their
place, which is doubly ironic since many philosophers, both ancient and
modern, tell us that nature is where we get our own ideas from in the
first place. This partly unconscious but totally illicit substitution is
hardly a promising basis for the development of science.</p>
<h4>The Knowledge Problem</h4>
<p>In a talk given to a ‘systematics’ group in America in 1981, Colin
Patterson, Senior Palaeontologist at the British Museum of Natural
History, quoted from the work Darwin and the Problem of Creation, by the
American historian Neal C. Gillespie, in which Gillespie had argued that
Creationism was “not a research governing theory, since its power to
explain is only verbal, but an anti-theory, a void that has the function
of knowledge but conveys none.” Patterson agreed with Gillespie on this,
but then he added statements to the effect that the very same
observation was true of Darwinism also, and that after studying Darwin’s
theory for more than twenty years he had learned “not one thing”. He
went on to challenge his audience to tell him one thing that they knew
for sure from their Darwinian studies. There followed a long silence,
before some humorist interjected “we know that it ought not to be taught
in high schools.”</p>
<p>There are very good grounds for Patterson’s assertion that Darwinism
also is “not a research governing theory.” They are: (1) that the theory
is deeply contradictory in its use of language; (2) that the findings of
any laboratory research project, or the observation of nature herself
and of the fossil record, important though these may be in our
understanding of the way that nature works, can do nothing to ‘prove’
the Darwinian theory itself, because all such findings and observations
can just as readily be explained in terms of an indwelling Consciousness
in nature—only the theory, not the evidential facts themselves, call for
its absence—so only the interpretation of evidence and not the evidence
itself needs to be changed; (3) that the phrases ‘God did it’ and
‘Chance did it’ are equally useless in providing grounds for scientific
research. As the British philologist Owen Barfield correctly asserted in
his book Saving the Appearances:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Chance, in fact, equals no hypothesis” and to resort to it in the
name of science means “that the impressive vocabulary of technological
investigation (associated with evolutionary biology) was actually being
used to denote its [science’s] breakdown; as though, because it is
something that we can do with ourselves in water, drowning should be
included as one of the ways of swimming”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is very clear that Patterson did not intend his remarks to be
taken in support of Creationism, but that is what has since happened.
Just about the only place that you will find his talk made available now
is on Creationist web sites. Perhaps this is why he did not mention the
matter in public again prior to his death in 1998.</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>Evolution itself is factually true, but the Darwinian theory itself
is a logician’s worst nightmare and the evidence for it, when viewed in
the light of what has been said here, is all but nonexistent. In any
other realm of scientific enquiry the kind of contradictions that this
theory embraces would have led to its demise long ago, because once it
is made conscious science cannot live with this kind of irrationality.
Let me then repeat what this irrationality consists in: (1) Darwin’s own
use of metaphorical and intentional language, now established as a
‘convention’ which certain defenders of the theory, notably Richard
Dawkins, now make use of with considerable relish; (2) the maladoption
of the word ‘mechanism,’ and with it all of the language of mechanical
‘design,’ to serve as a dictionary-authorized synonym for scientific
materialism; (3) Dennett’s “as if” excuse; (4) Provine’s purposeless
“mechanistic principles;” (5) because the concepts of ‘purpose’ and
‘design’ are inseparable, the widespread notion of ‘Designer-less
design,’ promoted by Dawkins and others, translates directly into the
oxymoronic concept of ‘purposeless purpose;’ (6) A.G. Cairns-Smith with
his “apples and oranges” comparison (7) the now much discussed fact that
the phrase ‘survival of the fittest’ (not used by Darwin) is a logical
tautology that has no value at all for knowledge. These, of course, are
all different examples of the same basic contradiction that underlies
the entire Darwinian theory. It ought to be three strikes and you’re
out, but such was the importance of this theory in the historical
emancipation of science from religion, that scientists have been more
than willing to disregard these logical defects, extreme though they may
be, and even try to turn them into virtues rather than face up to the
fact that in any other realm of scientific enquiry irrationality on so
broad a scale would long ago have proven fatal to any theory that
contained it.</p>
<p>It is reasonable to suggest that as the twenty-first century
progresses biology will gradually catch up with physics and will awaken
to the now inevitable conclusion, as expressed in the words of Sir
Arthur Eddington, that “The stuff of the world is mind-stuff”. This will
inevitably be a tremendous wrench; however, it will have the same kind
of impact on human thought that the Copernican revolution once had — as
Johann Wolfgang von Goethe described it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Perhaps a greater demand has never been made upon mankind; for by
this admission [that the earth is not the centre of the universe], how
much else did not collapse in dust and smoke: a second paradise, a world
of innocence, poetry, and piety, the faith; no wonder men had no stomach
for all this, that they ranged themselves in every way against such a
doctrine…”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stephen J. Gould has argued that there is no necessary conflict
between science and religion, that they are merely talking about
different things. That may be, but there is no denying that Darwinism
has all but vanquished the Creator God from modern religious discourse,
leaving only the Saviour God for those who still believe. A development
in the reverse direction, which I see to be inevitable, might well
increase our respect for religion, but it would not mean that science
must return to its religious roots. Too much time has passed for that to
happen, during which science has made enormous progress in other realms
of knowledge, realms in which there is no immediate conflict in causal
logic.</p>
<p>In order to solve the problem of origins, however, science must, for
the first time in nearly two centuries, again begin to take the
possibility of spiritual causes in nature seriously. This will require
that the concept of ‘empiricism’ be expanded beyond the realm of sense
observation to include observations made in the realm of ‘Ideas,’ as it
was in the work of Goethe, the great German poet/scientist, whose genius
gave the world the basis for a non-materialistic epistemology. One based
on the realization that both sense perception and imaginative thought,
if properly disciplined, can lead to scientific objectivity.</p>
