<p class="intro">Ariel Dorfman and I have a long history together. I first came across
his work when I devoured <a

to Read Donald Duck</a>, which he and Armand Mattelart wrote in Salvador
Allende’s democratic, socialist Chile. <a
href="https://tomdispatch.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6cb39ff0b1f670c349f828c73&amp;id=d621703df0&amp;e=69000829ac">The
New England Free Press</a>, where I was working as a printer, then
distributed it as part of its political literature program.  (After
General Augusto Pinochet’s 1973 military coup overthrew Allende and sent
Dorfman into exile, the Chilean military impounded many copies of it, <a
href="https://tomdispatch.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6cb39ff0b1f670c349f828c73&amp;id=910b909976&amp;e=69000829ac">burning
some of them and throwing others</a> in the ocean.) I first met Ariel in
the early 1980s when I was an editor at Pantheon Books and published his
pop-cultural critique of so many of the symbolic toys, books, and radio
and TV shows of my own childhood, <a
href="https://tomdispatch.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6cb39ff0b1f670c349f828c73&amp;id=6a745eb3ce&amp;e=69000829ac">The
Empire’s Old Clothes: What the Lone Ranger, Babar, and Other Innocent
Heroes Do to Our Minds</a>. Then I did <a
href="https://tomdispatch.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6cb39ff0b1f670c349f828c73&amp;id=f7772db4af&amp;e=69000829ac">Widows</a>,
his classic novel about the disappeared (in World-War-II-era Greece,
though his own Chile was there by implication). In this century, I
began <a
href="https://tomdispatch.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6cb39ff0b1f670c349f828c73&amp;id=9a7f1666ea&amp;e=69000829ac">publishing
pieces</a> of his at TomDispatch.</p>
<p>Only recently, I read his new… well, I don’t quite know what to call
it… novel? In it, he’s the central character and his life and events in
Chile (as well as the question of how Salvador Allende died and how, on
an ever more embattled planet, all of us may die) are at the heart of
everything. It’s both a unique and uniquely gripping book, a mix of
memoir and fiction of a sort I’ve never seen before. Its title, no less
gripping, is <a
href="https://tomdispatch.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6cb39ff0b1f670c349f828c73&amp;id=2d6b9e9200&amp;e=69000829ac">The
Suicide Museum</a> and its cover illustration is a stunning giant
woodpecker. I won’t tell you more. I’ll just say that I read every one
of its more than 600 pages with fascination and that I think you should
get your hands on it, too. Note that, in my 22 years at TomDispatch,
I’ve never put up a recommendation like this with a piece not written by
the book’s author but by me, though on a subject that’s all too central
to The Suicide Museum.</p>
