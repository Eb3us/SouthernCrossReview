        "I gave up my academic path even though I was totally passionate about quantum theory. I chose to dedicate my life to ecological work and activism because I realized that, yes, I would have amazing mental challenges—I could have been busy with quantum puzzles for 100 years—but it would have been an indulgence. Small studies were actually saving valleys, rivers, and forests. I realized that my service must go to the earth and to people.",

        "It began visiting a forest before I went off to do my Ph.D in Canada. I just wanted to carry memories with me and the oak forest that I wanted to trek in had been destroyed. I felt it as a personal, physical pain. That’s when I heard about the Chipko movement, where women of my region decided, “We’re going to hug the trees.” Chipko means to hug. “You will have to kill us before you kill the trees.” So I said, “Okay, I’ll do my PhD, but every vacation I will volunteer for this movement.” It became my other university and that’s what I’ve done since then: being an activist in the Chipko style.",

I waited until he casually mentioned that the snow had caused long delays at all airports. Nothing more. I turned on my living room heater and picked up the phone from my desk. When I dialed Alicia’s number a man answered. I was surprised because it was 8 o’clock on Friday morning and no man should have been there. “Er…Alicia, please?” I said.",
        "“Wrong number,” the man said, and hung up. That’s a relief, I thought and dialed again, more carefully this time. The same man answered. “Excuse me,” I said, “am I speaking with 760-4903?” He said yes, “…and no Alicia lives here.” He hung up again, this time with a bang and not a whimper. I couldn’t believe that Alicia had changed her number without telling me. But then women do strange things sometimes. I usually called her every day that we hadn’t seen each other, but lately I’d been busy with a lot of new clients, mostly because I designed a website for Charlie García, the rock star, and my phone had been ringing off the hook with future stars wanting a site like Charlie’s. When I told them the price (greatly increased since I became a star in my own right thanks to Charlie) and that payment was in advance, as well as the fact that I was backlogged for three months, most said they’d think about it and let me know.",

As her eyes moved down to the bag she saw something on the worn doormat that caused her to take a step back and place her hand over her mouth to stifle a scream: a chicken's head with the blood not yet dry, alongside it two broken vials with their contents of red and yellow powder spilled out over the mat. She knew what it was of course. Anyone who lived in Brazil would recognize a Macumba spell. She breathed deeply several times, fished out her keys and stepped carefully over the abomination.",

He heard basketball sounds coming from the gym: hard bounces on a wooden floor, the clang when the ball hit the rim, a whumpf when it went through cleanly. Shouts of triumph or despair. He looked at himself in the locker- room mirror and smiled with satisfaction. Smiling back at him was a young handsome face, the only imperfection on it being a slightly bent nose broken in a street fight during adolescence. He'd never had it straightened because it provided the manly touch his baby-face needed if he was to be taken seriously. He was only slightly above average height, too small for basketball, at least for the professional sort.",

The immigration agent frowned at the Argentine passport Jones showed him, with the name Matheu Tomás Jones. He answered before he was asked. He had no exit stamp from Argentina because the passport was new, issued by the Argentine consulate in Washington, where he had been living for several years.

The quantum revolution has largely been limited to physics, and even though it now claims, as was stated by Sir Arthur Eddington, that “The stuff of the world is mind-stuff” and that ‘Consciousness’ lies at the root of all physical phenomena, this has done little to influence biology. The Darwinian and neo-Darwinian theories still insist that Consciousness plays no role whatever in shaping the organic world, which it has long argued is primarily the product of chance. My task here will be to suggest that a similar revolution is overdue in biology, and that when it comes it will not challenge evolution itself, but will throw very serious doubt on Darwin’s account of how it all happened; it will not be a religious argument.",

        "1. La Antroposofía es un camino de conocimiento que guía lo espiritual en el ser humano hacia lo espiritual en el cosmos. Se manifiesta como una necesidad del corazón y del sentimiento. Encuentra su justificación en satisfacer esta necesidad. Sólo aquellos que encuentran en la Antroposofía lo que buscan en este sentido pueden apreciarla. Por ello, sólo pueden ser antropósofos quienes sienten ciertas preguntas sobre la naturaleza del hombre y del mundo como necesidades de la vida tan básicas como el hambre y la sed. 2. La Antroposofía imparte conocimientos obtenidos por medios espirituales. Sin embargo, sólo lo hace porque una vida cotidiana y una ciencia basada únicamente en la percepción de los sentidos y en la actividad intelectual conducen a un límite en el cual el alma humana se marchita si no logra cruzarlo. Sin embargo, no son esta vida cotidiana y esta ciencia las que impiden que el alma humana cruce este límite, sino que es justamente en la frontera en donde la percepción de los sentidos y el intelecto se agotan donde el mundo espiritual es revelado por el alma misma. 3. Algunas personas creen que todo el conocimiento termina en los límites de la percepción sensorial. Si estuvieran atentos a cómo toman conciencia de estos límites, también encontrarían en esta misma conciencia la capacidad de trascender esos límites. Un pez nada hasta los límites del agua; pero no puede cruzarlos porque carece de los órganos físicos para vivir fuera del agua. El hombre llega hasta los límites de su percepción sensorial; pero puede darse cuenta de que en el camino ha adquirido suficiente fuerza en su alma como para vivir en aquello que existe más allá de la percepción de los sentidos. 4. El hombre necesita el conocimiento del mundo espiritual para la seguridad de sus sentimientos y para el sano desarrollo de su voluntad. Entonces puede percibir en gran medida la grandeza, la belleza y la sabiduría del mundo natural. Sin embargo, este mundo natural no responde a las preguntas sobre su propio ser. Este ser es quien mantiene la materia y las fuerzas del mundo natural unidas en la forma corporal humana hasta que la persona cruza el umbral de la muerte. En ese momento, la naturaleza se apodera de la forma. Ella sola no puede mantenerla unida; sólo puede desgarrarla. Observando la Naturaleza en su grandeza, hermosura, y sabiduría intrínseca sólo podemos responder la pregunta de cómo se desintegra la forma humana, pero no de cómo se mantiene unida. Si un alma humana sensible decide no engañarse a sí misma, ninguna objeción teórica puede borrar esta pregunta  Y es esta pregunta la que sostiene en un alma humana verdaderamente despierta el deseo incesante de recorrer los caminos espirituales hacia el conocimiento del cosmos.",

No wonder it’s so hard, to the point of absurdity, to imagine a Pentagon that would humbly and faithfully serve only the interests of “national defense.”",

I’m not talking about a “woke” Pentagon that touts and celebrates its “diversity,” including its belated acceptance of LGBTQ+ members. I’m glad the Pentagon is arguably more diverse and tolerant now than when I served in the Air Force beginning in the early 1980s. Yet, as a popular meme has it, painting “Black Lives Matter” and rainbow flags on B-52 bombers doesn’t make the bombs dropped any less destructive. To be specific: Was it really a progressive milestone that the combat aircraft in last year’s Super Bowl flyover were operated and maintained entirely by female crews? Put differently, are the bullets and bombs of trans Black G.I. Jane somehow more tolerant and less deadly than cis White G.I. Joe’s?",

The northern hemisphere just experienced the hottest summer in recorded history, including month by month the warmest June, July, August, and (by a country mile) September ever. Staggering heat records were set in place after place globally. Fires from Canada to Hawaii to Europe broke all records. (In fact, those Canadian summer fires are now threatening to burn straight into the winter months for the first time — and I fear this phrase is going to be become all-too-boringly repetitive — in history.) The southern hemisphere had a “winter” from — yes! — hell. In Europe, which was burning up, Greece experienced unprecedented fires and floods as well. Libya had a significant part of a major city washed away. China, too, experienced unprecedented flooding around its capital, where 1.2 million people had to be evacuated, and in Hong Kong, too. The sea ice in the Antarctic fell to the lowest levels (yes again!) in recorded history, as did sea ice in the Arctic, helping to ensure a future in which rising sea levels could flood coastal cities. And Greenland has been lending a hand to that same future, starting 2023 with temperatures unmatched in at least 1,000 years and still setting new temperature records in July.

In this book she concentrates on a medical phenomenon which today has taken on the characteristics of a plague. Senility, involving short term memory loss and the general weakening of mental faculties associated with old age, has been known for centuries, but the illness we now call dementia or, in its more extreme stages, Alzheimer’s disease, has become more and more prevalent in modern society. Not only the aged are affected, but symptoms have been detected increasingly in the middle-aged, even in children. Before going further, it should be noted that there is a difference between “normal” old age forgetfulness and the illness which can lead to the affected persons becoming little more than living vegetables. The former is benign, the latter devastating.",
        "In her introduction von Halle describes why she decided to expand the first edition of this book, which was directed to readers who were familiar with anthroposophy and its terminology. When she was invited to give a talk at a Swiss retirement home, where many of the listeners would have little or no familiarity with anthroposophy, she decided to first give a basic overview of anthroposophical concepts before going into the details concerning the nature and causes of dementia. After her talk, members of the audience, both those with no previous knowledge of anthroposophy and even anthroposophists, told her that the inclusion of her explanation of anthroposophical concepts made everything much clearer. So for the new edition she decided to include the explanation. I won't blame anyone for thinking that as the translator of the book I may be prejudiced. However, I can honestly say that one of the reasons for which I offered to translate it was the clarity and conciseness of this short explanation in the chapter What is the Human Being, which begins:",

I first met Ariel in the early 1980s when I was an editor at Pantheon Books and published his pop-cultural critique of so many of the symbolic toys, books, and radio and TV shows of my own childhood, The Empire’s Old Clothes: What the Lone Ranger, Babar, and Other Innocent Heroes Do to Our Minds.

It’s both a unique and uniquely gripping book, a mix of memoir and fiction of a sort I’ve never seen before. Its title, no less gripping, is The Suicide Museum and its cover illustration is a stunning giant woodpecker. I won’t tell you more. I’ll just say that I read every one of its more than 600 pages with fascination and that I think you should get your hands on it, too. Note that, in my 22 years at TomDispatch, I’ve never put up a recommendation like this with a piece not written by the book’s author but by me, though on a subject that’s all too central to The Suicide Museum.",

It is hard to imagine a Macumba without having heard the wild, hours-long, stimulating yet monotone drumming through the night, and without having seen the participants falling into convulsive ecstasy as though shaken by a powerful invisible hand. It is questionable whether the word human can be used to describe these volitionless, wildly dancing creatures. They seem rather to be vessels into which a god or a spirit has been poured, who acts and romps and uses the mouth of an earthly being as his instrument, giving advice and answering questions which are asked via the medium. To be human means to be able to say \"I\", to use your head. But the overwhelming impression one gets at a Macumba is: away with the head, away with thinking and consciousness.
