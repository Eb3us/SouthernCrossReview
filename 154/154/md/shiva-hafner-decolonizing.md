### From Greed to Care

by [Gerhard Häfner ](https://dasgoetheanum.com/en/author/geraldhafner/) and
Vanda Shiva


**Vandana Shiva spoke at the Goetheanum in February of this year.
Before her talk, Gerald Häfner interviewed her about changing the
world.**
<hr />

**You could have had a perfect career in physics, philosophy, economy,
or academia, but you didn't. Why not?**

I gave up my academic path even though I was totally passionate about
quantum theory. I chose to dedicate my life to ecological work and
activism because I realized that, yes, I would have amazing mental
challenges---I could have been busy with quantum puzzles for 100
years---but it would have been an indulgence. Small studies were
actually saving valleys, rivers, and forests. I realized that my service
must go to the earth and to people.

**When did you know that you needed to do something for the earth?**

It began visiting a forest before I went off to do my Ph.D in Canada. I
just wanted to carry memories with me and the oak forest that I wanted
to trek in had been destroyed. I felt it as a personal, physical pain.
That's when I heard about the Chipko movement, where women of my region
decided, "We're going to hug the trees." Chipko means to hug. "You will
have to kill us before you kill the trees." So I said, "Okay, I'll do my
PhD, but every vacation I will volunteer for this movement." It became
my other university and that's what I've done since then: being an
activist in the Chipko style.

**Then you did research on the death of the indigenous form of
agriculture through industrialized agriculture.**

Every question I've tried to answer has been related to unnecessary
violence against the earth or against people. The destruction of the
forests in my home region was the first, but the eruption of violence in
Punjab, where the Green Revolution was first applied, was the second.
The Green Revolution is the name for industrial agriculture in the Third
World. In 1984, a pesticide plant in a city called Bhopal leaked and
killed thousands. People are still dying, children are still born
maimed---the disaster is not over. That year I decided to study this
model of farming. I found out that to sell leftover war chemicals, the
industry had changed our idea of farming, our relationship to the land,
our relationship to food, and defined soil as an empty container and
plants as machines run with fertilizer as fuel. The life of living
systems disappeared and the amazing knowledge of farming communities was
erased. I realized, "I've dedicated my life to ecological work, but
agriculture is an orphan of the ecology movement." So I said, "I will
look for a nonviolent path for farming."

**You weren't looking for money or power but asking, "What can I
do?"**

Absolutely. It came from a deep, deep compassion for the living earth
and a deep, deep compassion for fellow human beings. I believe
compassion is the real currency that flows between us. Words have been
impoverished by colonialism, which reduced currency to money and
investment to making money. Currency means flow. What flows between us
is love and compassion. That flow is disrupted by the growth of
fictitious currencies: money, profits, power.

**One could say that life is compassion, that it's a gift from the
very first day.**

You're so right. I've just done a book called *From Greed to Care.*
The economy of care begins with us coming into this world from our
mother's womb. If there wasn't unconditional love, no child would be
taken care of. The first economy is the gift economy.

**But how is it then, Vandana, that we are destroying the earth, each
other, and ourselves?**

Well, in India, it's extremely clear. It begins with colonialism---a
handful of people in Europe deciding they want rich lands in other
places. India was 30% of the world economy at that time. The British,
overnight, declared that the soil of India belonged to England and
started to collect rent. Adam Smith, who merely described how colonial
commerce works and the biases in it, is called the father of modern
economics. This is not economy. Economy is derived from *oikos*: our
home. So the home disappeared, *oikos* disappeared, and with it, greed
became not only dominant, but worse: it brutally declared that those who
live with compassion and care are primitive and barbarian. In a way, I
feel it's our time to say, "If compassion is to be barbaric, I'd rather
be barbaric." I think it is time for us to shift our minds, to think in
different ways.

**Should we change the structures or should we change ourselves?**

I don't think it's given to us to change structures because they've made
themselves invisible. They've made themselves remote---distant and
unaccountable. But we can change ourselves and structures will change in
the process. You can either keep hammering on Monsanto's and Bayer's
door saying, "Please don't, please don't", or, you can just save a seed
with love and create a seeds commons---and Monsanto's project shrinks
simultaneously. Begin with ourselves. As Gandhi said---and he is my
teacher---"Be the change you want to see."

**I completely agree but when we say we should begin with ourselves,
what are Monsanto or Bayer or these companies other than concepts
created, organized, and run by humans?**

Take the first corporation that was created: East India Company. It was
created by a few human beings, not all of humanity. I think it's
extremely important to not universalize the false constructions of the
powerful and the privileged. They are the worst aspect of humanity. And
yes, of course, we must begin with ourselves. We change in our minds and
in our hearts, but we live in an interconnected world. In the quantum
world, nothing can be separated: the 'fact' of separation is an
illusion. It's oneness that is the reality. Interconnection is reality.
Therefore, the actions and thinking and values that you bring to the
world in your life begin to become values and changes in the larger
world.

**I am creating the future constantly, with the way I think. It starts
with the way I feel, with the way I act.**

Absolutely. I think a big part of the colonial instinct is that the
plunderers declare themselves as the creators. When I shoot a gene into
the cell of a plant, I'm not creating that plant---it is not a creative
act, it's a warlike act. So this illusion of destruction being creation
has blocked us from recognizing our own power and our own creativity.
Our creativity is not separate from the creativity of the earth. The
earth was declared dead: *Terra nullius*. That's where all the
violence against her is legitimized. But we are part of a living earth,
a living universe, an intelligent, conscious universe. Playing our role
within that universe, as an ordinary farmer will tell you, we uphold the
universe by the right action.

**Could we say that evil begins with the loss of relation?**

I think reality is relation. Objectification is a violent illusion that
gives permission to treat a seed, a plant, a river or a mountain, as if
it was just an object. Then there is the deeper illusion that by
destroying it, by bringing in bulldozers and spreading glyphosate, I am
improving the land. The idea of improvement is part of an acceleration
of violence.

**We forgot about the divine, about other spiritual beings, and we
took things just as mere matter to conquer, to reign. How can we
overcome that?**

Well, you know, we're sitting in the Goetheanum. Goethe had another
mind, right? I think that Europe needs to rediscover its other mind.

**You spoke about the Green Revolution. I started a political
organization called the Greens---we invented that name in the late
seventies in Germany. We called it the Greens because we wanted to
relate to nature, to hope, to the living, and then it was used as a
concept to kill. How is this that good impulses are turned to evil?**

The use of the word green for the industrial agriculture of killing
precedes the use of the word green for the Green Party. There were two
projects, two impulses for the Green Revolution. First, to contain the
Red Revolution spreading from China---so, green rather than red. The
second was to create a market for leftover war chemicals and
technologies. The assumption was that by calling it green, no one would
look at what it really was about. The first application was in my
country in 1965-66. I was in high school at that time and it wasn't in
our consciousness. No one knew that this was happening until 1984 when
the violence erupted. I realized that it's not that good intentions turn
to evil, it's much more simple and crude---evil is always looking to
co-opt good words, good values, and put them in the service of greed.

**I still believe, even in this world of companies and governments
that try to rule the world, that within every human being there is a
self that is searching for relation, for resonance, for being equivalent
with the other and the world. How can we set this free?**

I think every crisis, as the Chinese say, has to be an opportunity. We
are now living through a crisis where even ordinary people of the richer
part of the world are suffering like the southern world has always
suffered. Globalization was nothing but the destruction of local
economies. Now it's coming here \[Europe\], with the welfare state being
dismantled. Any capacity for redistributing wealth and power in society
is under attack. I think this is a moment for the common search of a
life fulfilled, where all of us have our place on earth, both in terms
of nourishing the earth and letting the earth nourish us. That is both a
duty and a right. It's Indian peasants saying, "We will not be pushed
off the land. We will not allow laws to dispossess us." But we need
similar movements everywhere. Young people want to go back to the land,
to live lives beyond consumerism, beyond the money machine of Wall
Street.

**If we open our imagination to the future, to what needs and wants to
come, do you have ideas how to transform this economy we live in and
with?**

The first is to not allow it to be treated as inevitable that the 1%
will own all the resources and wealth of the planet. That's an illusion.
We need ways to share the wealth, to stop taking more than is right from
the earth. We need to shift from an extractive economy and measuring
growth, to giving and the gift economy that Howard called the Law of
Return. That means reclaiming the Earth's gifts as a commons. What are
the basic things we need? We need food and clothing; we need knowledge;
we need culture. None of this requires the billions of the
philanthrocapitalists. It requires compassion within society and a
refusal to feel hopeless or afraid.

**Should we rethink our concepts of land ownership?**

Again, these ideas of private property were created by colonialism. Land
in India could not be bought and sold. As we used to say, the creator
created the land and owns the land---we are merely custodians.
Custodians don't have ownership rights---they have a duty to care. I
feel grateful that I've had an opportunity to prevent the privatization
of seed: before they could do it, we stopped them. How many movements
have I worked with in India to not allow the privatization of water? The
women of Plachimada who fought Coca-Cola; the citizens across the
beautiful Ganges who joined hands---I remember the petition to the World
Bank: "our mother Ganga is not for sale". Land, seed, water and food are
commons. Knowledge is too. Think of the Vedas and the Upanishads of
India---brilliant people never said, "written and authored by
so-and-so..." Mr. Gates, who constantly patents things, said "I have
invented the flood tolerance gene." You cannot pretend that you have
created what nature creates or that you have created what other people
create through their collective creativity.

**We started a movement in Germany that we call responsible
ownership---Verantwortungseigentum---which asserts that companies are
not commodities. If you look behind the curtain when Bayer "bought"
Monsanto, the main owner of Bayer at that time was BlackRock, Vanguard,
and Capital St, and the main owner of Monsanto was Capital St, BlackRock
and Vanguard---the same. This idea of global capitalism, where you can
buy and sell everything---you buy and sell a company, you buy and sell
people with all their knowledge and their capacities---it's completely
crazy. Now most young entrepreneurs who want to build up companies
say, "We don't want private ownership: we want to work with others,
we want the company to belong to all of us."**

I wrote the book *Oneness Vs. the 1%* precisely because we found out
how Monsanto was being bought by Bayer, and we found exactly what you're
saying: Blackrock and Vanguard. Who are they? Asset management
companies, managing the financial assets of billionaires. The land, the
minerals, the forests, and the rivers have been privatized, and that's
why we are in a crisis. Those who created the economy of illusion now
want to own the last drop of water, the last inch of land, the last
capacity for carbon sequestering on the planet. But I know a river can
only be looked after by the people around the river; the soil can only
be taken care of by the farmer who works it. Trading on Wall Street is
not care. Trading on Wall Street is not stewardship.

**Who could be the agent of this change that is needed?**

I don't think we are in the kind of times when a Gandhi or a Marx or a
Mandela will emerge. What we should look for is catalytic leadership
from everywhere: from soil organisms that make land flourish again; from
plants that are elders on this planet, that have lived much longer and
can teach us how to belong, how to grow, and how to give in generosity.
Young people and children can be our teachers, elders can be our
teachers. And indigenous people, for sure.

**What can we in Europe learn from indigenous people?**

First that the earth is sacred. Second, that their first identity is
common identity. Third, that your purpose on earth is to take care of
the Earth and of community. Indigenous people have amazing cultures of
constantly engaging in gifting. When I saw a ceremony where the seed was
brought by the tribes to be shared, I realized this idea of the commons
was a reality as an organizing principle in indigenous cultures.

Live lightly. Increase your creative articulations through the homes you
build, the music you create, and the way you nourish young children.
Don't follow the idea that if you can extract more and dominate more,
you're somehow superior.

I think there are two really serious problems. One is anthropocentrism,
that humans are superior to other beings. Indigenous people teach us
that we are members of the Earth family and all other beings are our
relatives. The second is that there is no intelligence beyond a few
people's minds. But intelligence is everywhere---intelligence is life.
New research on intelligence and the indigenous peoples' knowledge of
everything being conscious are now converging.

**Does this mean that indigenous people are wiser than today's
academics?**

Well, you know, academics have a particular way of knowing the world, by
not knowing it. The epistemology of mechanistic reductionism that
permeates every field began with how physics and natural sciences were
thought about by Mr. Bacon. But the way natural sciences are done is
also the way social sciences are done. Mechanistic reductionism
basically says that the world is full of objects that are separate from
each other To recognize that there is no separation and the world is not
populated by objects but beings---that, for sure, is wisdom that
indigenous people have and those groomed in mechanistic thought have
lost.

**Is there anything that academics, or we Western and European people,
can contribute?**

I think everyone can contribute, as long as it is with humility, without
superiority or thinking that other beings or other cultures are less.
Huge advances have been made in Western science that can be put to the
service of the earth and society. All the work being done on ecology,
epigenetics, evolutionary biology, symbiosis, all of those amazing
streams of knowledge actually have total coherence with indigenous
paradigms. I work on soil. I work with farmers and their knowledge, but
we have a lab where we dialogue with the soil microorganisms, which we
could not see without the microscope.

**The first time we met was 1992, in Münich, where I co-organized The
Other Economic Summit---the summit against the World Economic Summit.
Now we sit here, 30 years later, and I'm listening to you tell me about
spiritual science. You're aware of the Goetheanum and the background
behind biodynamics and anthroposophy. Do you have any relation to
them?**

Not in the deep way that you all do, but of course I've heard and read
about Goethe. I don't know the details of Steiner's thinking, but I know
Waldorf schools. In a way, that thinking is exactly the same as Tagore's
thinking about learning and Gandhi's thinking about what education
should be. There are amazing convergences.

**It's such a pity that Goethe and this whole stream was forgotten or
broken through German history. Steiner took it up and tried to evolve it
for all realms of knowledge and practice. When I listen to you, I have
the feeling that you might have never heard or read about it, but you
have found it another way, through another door.**

When you talk about how that stream of Goethean thought was put
underground, my mind is going to 1484, eight years before the papal bull
which legalized the doctrine of taking over the land of other people.
But eight years before that was the papal bull on the Inquisition and
the witch hunts, targeting anyone who thought differently, who had their
own knowledge of healing plants, most of them women healers. I believe
we are living under witch hunts again. When we think of the power of
those who control Big Pharma, they basically see any free thinking, any
independent, sovereign path, as something to be afraid of---to
extinguish like a swatted fly.

**It's about relation and resonance, but it's also about freedom,
about developing one's own thinking in a way that we flee this
imprisoned kind of thinking.**

Change begins with you, and it begins with enlarging your capacity, your
own potential. That potential gets enlarged through your relationships.
The wider and deeper our relationships become, the more we ourselves get
enhanced. That's our freedom.

I wrote the book *Earth Democracy* in terms of freedom for the Earth
and ourselves as part of the Earth, because we were defined as the
anti-globalization movement. I said, "No, we are an Earth democracy
movement." Every time they said, "Oh, you know what you're against, but
you don't know what you're for," I said, "No, we are for life. We are
for love. We are for community. We are for the commons. That's why we
are against privatization and seed patents, against corporations
controlling our food supply, against the idea that one World Trade
Organization sitting in Geneva can set the rules of how we live."

We had a beautiful moment. I think 6,000 communities in India got
organized on the 5th of June 1999, because I told them what's happening
with the WTO, etc. I said, "Tell them. Tell Mike Moore," who was the
Director-General of WTO, "tell him what you think." And they sent
postcards. They said, "We understand that you want to own the seed, you
want to own the plants. Even in our society we have people who steal.
Usually there's a desperation: a child will steal because the mother is
ill, a mother will steal because a child is hungry. And if they explain,
then we clearly do not treat them as criminals---we ensure that they get
medicine, that they get the food that they need, as part of our
community. Come and sit under the banyan tree in our village and explain
to us: what is your desperation that makes you want to steal the last
seed from the poorest farmer of the world?"

It's those kinds of creative actions that came from the people
themselves, that then shifted the discussion and the imagination. Just
like it's wrong to say that some plants are weeds and should be killed
by herbicides, it is wrong to say that people are useless. Every plant,
every insect, every human being has a contribution to make and society
collectively has a duty to defend their space and let them evolve on
their terms.

**Many young people are afraid about whether there will be a future at
all and whether we still have the time to make this deep transformation.
Vandana, do we still have time?**

Well, life is a process, and in this process, there's never a moment
that says, "there is no time." So I think we need to get out of the
mechanistic idea of time and the idea that urgency means now, and switch
to the recognition that time is the flow through which life evolves and
recycles. Urgency means importance, not speed. It means doing the right
thing, finding the right niche for us to occupy as human beings, not
another wave of mastery of the kind that's being planned: geoengineering
and changing the climate even more, or engineering lab food and cellular
meat. As Einstein said, to do the same thing again and again and expect
a solution is a clear sign of insanity.

I think part of it is that children are being made afraid. But I have
seen what happens when I bring children to the Navdanya farm and I work
with them on the carbon cycle. I work with them on the power of the soil
and the power of the green leaf of the plant to draw down carbon
dioxide. And suddenly the child's mind, instead of being the mind
preoccupied by fear, becomes the creative mind to become one with the
earth, to say, "I am here to serve you. You show me the way."

I think there's hope. As long as there's life. As long as there's
potential for life, there's hope.
