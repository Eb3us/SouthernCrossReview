<p class="intro">I woke up shivering from the cold, naked under a sheet. It must be a
very unusual and sudden cold snap, I thought. Buenos Aires has some cool
days in autumn, but not freezing like this. I jumped out of bed and ran
to the closet from which I took underwear including an undershirt, which
I only wear in winter, then a shirt and jeans and socks. I dressed
quickly and realized it wasn’t enough. I took a sweater from a drawer
and put it on. Then I looked at the window, which was clouded over. I
put on my glasses, which I usually only use for reading, and looked
again at the window. Then I went over to it and saw that it wasn’t
merely clouded, it was frosted over, something I hadn’t seen since I
lived in Switzerland. Thick frost with out-splaying lines from dark
moons. I didn’t want to open the window and let in the cold, but if I
wanted to look outside I had no alternative. The catch was frozen and I
had to use both hands to open it.</p>
<p>I looked down at La Pampa Street from my third floor apartment. It
was snowing! But it never snowed in Buenos Aires, not even in winter. A
few cars flowed slowly along, throwing up snowpuffs behind them.
Pedestrians walked with their heads down into the wind, bundled up in
heavy winter clothing.</p>
<p>Something very unusual was happening. The news! I turned on the TV.
The anchorperson was talking about the war in Iraq. More suicide
bombers, a mosque blown up. I waited until he casually mentioned that
the snow had caused long delays at all airports. Nothing more. I turned
on my living room heater and picked up the phone from my desk. When I
dialed Alicia’s number a man answered. I was surprised because it was 8
o’clock on Friday morning and no man should have been there. “Er…Alicia,
please?” I said.</p>
<p>“Wrong number,” the man said, and hung up. That’s a relief, I thought
and dialed again, more carefully this time. The same man answered.
“Excuse me,” I said, “am I speaking with 760-4903?” He said yes, “…and
no Alicia lives here.” He hung up again, this time with a bang and not a
whimper. I couldn’t believe that Alicia had changed her number without
telling me. But then women do strange things sometimes. I usually called
her every day that we hadn’t seen each other, but lately I’d been busy
with a lot of new clients, mostly because I designed a website for
Charlie García, the rock star, and my phone had been ringing off the
hook with future stars wanting a site like Charlie’s. When I told them
the price (greatly increased since I became a star in my own right
thanks to Charlie) and that payment was in advance, as well as the fact
that I was backlogged for three months, most said they’d think about it
and let me know.</p>
<p>I also had a regular job as a programmer, but had more or less
decided to quit and be my own boss – at last! Because of all that
activity I hadn’t called Alicia for at least a week, although she’d left
several messages on my answering machine. Still, is that a reason to
disconnect herself from life, or at least from me?</p>
<p>I put on a sweater and my heaviest coat – which wasn’t very heavy –
and walked around the corner to the garage where I parked my car. I was
shivering. The people I passed were bundled up in heavy parkas and wore
boots. When I walked into the garage the attendant, Rosas, said,
“<em>Buen día, Sr. Hernandez</em>.” I stopped in my tracks and stared at
him. The greeting was as usual, except that my name isn’t Hernandez.
“Something wrong, señor?” he asked. I shook my head. My name, Suárez, is
almost as common, so he could be confused, why not? I handed him the
keys and he walked to the rear of the garage to bring my car to the
entrance for me. I saw the short puff of smoke emerge from the exhaust
of my red Fiat. Then he backed out expertly from between the tightly
packed cars and pulled up alongside me. It looked like my car and it had
come from my space, but the license plate number was wrong – or had I
confused that too? “Are you sure this is my car, Rosas?” I asked him. He
looked at me as he would a madman. “Of course it is, Sr. Hernandez, but
I’m not Rosas.” I took out my wallet and checked the automobile
registration. It showed the same number as that on the license plate,
and it belonged to Hernandez.</p>
<p>I thought I was dreaming, a confusing dream no doubt, but then aren’t
most if not all dreams confusing? (I pinched myself; it hurt.) I decided
to ride with it and see where it would lead me. I also resolved to
record all the details of the dream when I woke up. This was the first
time I had known during a dream that I was dreaming, so I certainly had
never before resolved to record the dream during the dream. This fact
should have acted as a wake up call (no pun intended).</p>
<p>I drove towards Alicia’s place, but as I got to the Palermo Gardens
shopping center on Avenida Santa Fe, I drove into the underground
garage, parked and entered the first clothing store to buy a heavy coat
and boots for the snow. The store had just opened so I was the only
customer. I selected the most expensive items, including a fur hat. (Why
not, if it's only a dream?) I took out my debit card and was just about
to hand it to the clerk when something struck me – a thought, not a
brick, although it felt like one. Numbers seemed to be awry: Alicia’s
telephone (although I hadn’t yet abandoned the idea that she had changed
it due to pique at me), my car registration. What if my PIN had changed
as well? I put the card back and pulled out my American Express credit
card, which required no PIN. The name on it was Juan Hernandez. I looked
at the bank card: the same. So Rosas (by any other name) was right and I
didn’t even know who I was. I smiled at my clever, oh so realistic dream
and handed the clerk (a pretty girl by the way) my American Express
card.</p>
<p>Thus protected against the imaginary elements, I drove on to Alicia’s
apartment just off Plaza San Martín. I pressed the bell to 3B and she
answered immediately: “Sí?”</p>
<p>“It’s me, Pablo, also known as Juan,” I spoke into the intercom.</p>
<p>“Oh,” she said, not very enthusiastically, but she pressed the button
and I entered. She’d left the door open to her apartment, so I walked in
without knocking. She was dressed in a thick bulging coat, trousers,
snow boots like mine and a woolen hat pulled over her ears and almost to
her eyebrows, and was stuffing stuff into her shoulder-bag. The last
time I’d seen her, only a week ago, she was wearing a miniskirt.</p>
<p>“Hi, Pablo,” she said, “what’s the Juan bit about?”</p>
<p>“Oh, just an unfunny joke…” I almost added “Ali”, but her name might
have changed, be different in my dream, so I didn’t dare say it.</p>
<p>“And what are you doing here at this time of the morning?”</p>
<p>“I just wanted to tell you that I’m sorry I haven’t phoned you all
week, but I’ve been…”</p>
<p>“I know you’ve been busy, darling,” she interrupted. “As a matter of
fact so have I, so no problem.”</p>
<p>“Oh, good.” With that off my mind I didn’t know what to say next.
“How about a cup of coffee?” I hadn’t had breakfast and I could have
used some. But she just raised her eyebrows and laughed. “Are you
kidding? Don’t you know the time? I have to get to work, and so do you.
Or did you quit already?”</p>
<p>“Er..no, not yet.”</p>
<p>“Well, help yourself, lover, the kitchen is yours and the coffee is
still hot,” she said as she brushed passed me with a brushing kiss.
“Just close the door well on your way out. Bye-ee.”</p>
<p>Alicia was a real good kid, smart, good company and sexy and I was in
love with her. She had one defect – in my eyes (ears actually) – she
laughed at the wrong times. But my karma seems to have preordained me to
be involved with women who laugh at the wrong times. First there was
Judy, who was the most talented of all in this respect. During a play an
actor would make a remark that she thought was a joke and a peel of
laughter shook the theater. People turned from all sides and looked at
us; it was embarrassing – for me, not for her: ten minutes later she’d
do the same thing. She had no sense of humor and didn’t understand
jokes. Then there was Jeanne, a beautiful, intelligent, sensitive woman,
who giggled before every sentence. Her giggles were like quotations
marks. Alicia was too shy to laugh out loud in public, but did so loudly
in private, watching a movie on TV, for example. She could easily have
replaced canned laughter. I on the other hand hardly laugh at all. When
something really tickles my funny bone I just sort of squeak like a
mouse in labor.</p>
<p>That’s all a digression. I had to find out what Ali’s new name was.
But first I went into the kitchen and poured myself a cup of coffee and
put two slices of bread into the toaster. Then, with the coffee cup in
hand, I went into her work-room. There were envelopes on the desk, some
bills and a personal letter. The name on all of them was Zoé. Zoé? What
the hell kind of name is that? And Rosenberg. Alicia was a practicing
Catholic, one good reason why I was reluctant to marry her. Hard to get
a divorce unless you’re a movie star. Did you change religions with the
frost? Well, I thought aloud, I’m nothing; maybe now I’m something.
Alicia-Zoé would have died laughing at that one. I only squeaked.</p>
<p>After breakfast I trudged through the snowdrifts that covered the
Plaza San Martín and reached the knees of the Liberator’s statue and
entered my employer’s office on Maipú Street. The boss and founder,
Francisco by name, was in his office and receiving, signaled by the
green light over his door. (red means Don’t Dare Disturb.) Luckily his
dream-name, Hugo, was stenciled on the door. Francisco-Hugo was a paean
of democracy: he wore jeans, never a tie and had curly hair down to his
shoulders – and, except for the hair, expected everyone else on his
“team” to dress accordingly.</p>
<p>I already mentioned my intention to leave the company, but I didn’t
have the courage to actually do it. I had a lot of independent work now,
but who knows what the situation would be in a year, or even six months.
Was sink or swim really for me? But since I was still merely dreaming,
there was no reason why I couldn’t simply walk up to Pancho (as he
preferred to be called) and say: “I quit, Pancho, you pompous creep.” I
walked into his office without knocking.</p>
<p>“Hola, Juan,” he said, glancing aside from his computer. He seemed to
have the uncanny ability to look at you with one eye while keeping the
other glued to the screen. “You’ve been doing great work lately, so I
decided to give you a raise, fifteen percent.” His eye swiveled back to
the screen. “Effective immediately.” He must have heard about my
moonlighting, I thought, and this is his way of keeping me at his beck
and call. Dream or no dream, it knocked me off balance, along with him
now being Hugo and not Pancho. “Anything else?”</p>
<p>“Well, no Pa…, thanks,” I mumbled, and resolved to use this dream
scene as preparation for the real thing.</p>
<p>“Okay, see you later.” Dismissed.</p>
<p>I left his office and went to my work-station, clicked on my computer
and typed in my user name and password.</p>
<p>ERROR! flashed on the screen: User name and password incorrect. Shit!
Of course this had to happen. The User Name was easy. My real one was
suarezp (last name and initial); so now it had to be hernandezj. But the
password was a random series of eight digits. Maybe a logical method for
transposing the real to the dream digits existed somewhere in my
unconscious, but it would be easier to extract it from the software
somehow. As I was pondering this, a colleague passed by and joked,
“Don’t think so much, Juan, let the machine do it for you.” I just
smiled and waved and let the machine do it for me. If it really had
Artificial Intelligence, I could just ask, but for that I needed the
password. I couldn’t get it from Windows, so I re-booted and sneaked
into DOS. A half hour later I had cut into the computer’s guts and
retrieved the valid password. I wrote it in ink on my palm, entered it
in Windows and I was in business. I doubted anyone else on the team
could have done that – except Pancho-Hugo of course.</p>
<p>I worked well into the night, wanting to get the day over with, but
it was hard to concentrate on the work, especially when names and
numbers had all changed.</p>
<p>I fell into bed under three blankets (I borrowed one from a neighbor
whose dream name I never found out) and my new coat, not knowing, or by
then caring, what the new day would bring.</p>
<p>The doorbell woke me. I opened my eyes and saw the sunrays flitting
through the window-shutters and making patterns on my bed. I was
sweating. I staggered to the door, pressed the speaker button and asked,
“Sí?</p>
<p>“Hola, it’s me,” a metallic voice answered.”</p>
<p>“Zoé!” I exclaimed.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I mean: Alicia!” I buzzed her in, opened the door and waited in the
hall for the elevator to arrive.</p>
<p>“Who’s Zoé?” were her first words, naturally.</p>
<p>“Nobody, I was dreaming. You woke me up.”</p>
<p>“May I come in?”</p>
<p>“Oh, sorry, yes of course.” Inside my apartment she kissed me,
passionately, if I may say so. I returned the passion, being really glad
to see her.</p>
<p>“You look terrible. You’ve been working too hard. You can at least
relax on Saturday. What’s this?” she asked looking at a pile of winter
garments on the living room floor: my new coat, the boots and woolen
hat. “And there’s a puddle under them, it’ll ruin your floor.” I shook
my head and opened the living room window and the shutter. Warm April
sunshine returned happily to my life. I pinched myself to see if I was
dreaming; it hurt.</p>
<p>Now, many years later, I still live in the same apartment – third
floor on La Pampa Street, and I’m finally getting around to writing
about that long ago April interlude. The delay is because I hoped it
would all be explained somehow, and perhaps it has, at least to the
extent that such things are explainable.. Alicia and I did get married,
by the way, when she agreed not to do it in the Catholic Church. I was
born into the Church myself, had escaped though, and was determined to
stay as far away as possible from the moldy monks. Also, if the marriage
didn’t work out they wouldn’t recognize its validity anyway. But it did
work out. We lived happily ever after, so to speak. She was the only one
I ever told about that April. It was just before our wedding in case she
wanted to change her mind. She listened, nodded, and never mentioned it
again. A smart woman.</p>
<p>Recently I’ve been reading about quantum physics and a theory of
parallel universes. Essentially it says that all the possibilities
described by quantum theory (which seem to be infinite) simultaneously
occur in a “multiverse”, composed of those other universes. However,
according to the theory of quantum decoherence (love that name), the
parallel universes will never be accessible for us, making them
physically meaningless. Why? Because once a measurement is done, the
measured system becomes entangled with both the physicist who measured
it and a huge number of other particles, some of which are photons
flying away towards the other end of the universe. In order to prove
anything, one would have to bring all those particles back and measure
them again, together with the system that was measured originally. This
is completely impractical, but even if one can theoretically do it, it
would destroy any evidence that the original measurement took place,
including the physicist's memory.</p>
<p>This applies to a physicist doing a conscious experiment. I, however,
am neither a physicist nor was I performing a conscious experiment. I
was completely unaware of what was happening, so much so that I confused
it with a dream. And perhaps for this reason my memory was not
destroyed. The question therefore arises: Am I the only one, or only the
first to travel to a parallel universe (if indeed that is what
occurred)? Or are there others, many others (necessarily non-physicists)
who have had similar experiences but either confused them with dreams or
are too embarrassed to mention them?</p>
<p>And – What does it matter? Life goes on quite satisfactorily in my
own little home universe. One the other hand, if I were a physicist I
could write a paper disputing the theory of “quantum decoherence” based
on experience. But there are too many imponderables such as: if I was in
one how did I get there? And, how did I get out? And, why? Another
imponderable, so much so that I prefer not to think about it, is that my
name is neither Juan Hernandez nor Pablo Suarez, but Roberto Fox. If it
weren’t for the coat, the boots, the fur hat and the double-stitch
woolen socks (forgot to mention them), worrying objects molding in my
hall closet, I’d say it was just a cruelly cool April dream and let it
be.</p>
