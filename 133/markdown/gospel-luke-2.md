### Lecture Two

Basel, September 16, 1909 -- GA 114

Throughout the Christian era the Gospel of St. John was the text that
made the strongest impression upon those who were trying to deepen their
understanding of the cosmic mysteries of Christianity. This was the
Gospel used by all the Christian mystics who were striving to mould
their lives in accordance with its presentation of the personality and
nature of the Christ Jesus.

In the course of the centuries a somewhat different attitude was adopted
by Christian humanity to the Gospel of Luke --- an attitude altogether
in keeping with the indications given in the last lecture, from another
point of view, regarding the contrast between these two Gospels. Whereas
the Gospel of John was in a certain sense a text for mystics, the Gospel
of Luke was always a devotional book for humble folk, for those whose
simplicity and innocence of heart enabled them to rise into the sphere
of truly Christian feeling. The Gospel of Luke has been a book of
devotion throughout the centuries. For all those who were bowed down
with sorrow or suffering it was a fount of consolation, speaking with
such tenderness of the great Comforter, the great Benefactor of mankind,
the Saviour of the heavy-laden and oppressed. It was a book to which
especially those who longed to be filled with Christian love turned
their hearts and minds, because the power of love is revealed more
clearly in this Gospel than in any other Christian document. Those who
were in any way conscious --- and strictly speaking this applies to
everyone --- of having the burden of some guilt upon their hearts, at
all times found consolation and edification when they turned to the
Gospel of Luke and understood its message. They could say to themselves:
the Christ Jesus came not only for the righteous but also for sinners;
He sat with publicans and transgressors. Whereas much preparation is
necessary before the full power of John\'s Gospel can be realized, it
may be said of Luke\'s Gospel that no nature is too immature to be aware
of the warmth streaming from it. From the earliest times this Gospel was
an inspiration to the most childlike of men. All that remains childlike
in the human soul from tenderest youth to ripest age has always felt
drawn to the Gospel of Luke. And as regards pictorial representations of
Christian truths and what art has acquired from these truths, we find
that although much is derived from the other Gospels, the indications
for the most intimate messages conveyed to the human heart by forms of
art, by paintings, are to be found precisely in the Gospel of St. Luke.
The portrayals of the deep connection between the Christ Jesus and John
the Baptist have their source in this imperishable Gospel. Anyone who
allows it to work upon his soul will find that from beginning to end it
gives expression to the principle of love, compassion and innocence ---
in a certain sense, childlike innocence. Where else do we find such a
tender portrayal of the childlike nature as in what is said of the
childhood of Jesus of Nazareth in the Gospel of St. Luke? The reason
will become clear as we penetrate more deeply into the words of this
wonderful text.

It will be necessary now to say certain things that may seem paradoxical
to those of you who have heard other lectures or courses of lectures
given by me on the same subject. But if you will wait for the
explanations to be given in the next lectures, you will realize that
what I shall say is in harmony with what you have previously heard from
me about the Christ Jesus and Jesus of Nazareth. The whole complicated
range of truth cannot be presented all at once, and today I shall have
to indicate an aspect of the Christian truths that may seem not to tally
exactly with what has been said on some previous occasion. Our procedure
must be, first to show how the separate currents of truth have developed
and then the mutual agreement and harmony that finally become apparent.
The Gospel of St. John was deliberately our starting-point, and I was
naturally unable to indicate more than part of the truth in the various
courses of lectures. What was said still holds good, as we shall see,
although our attention to-day must be turned to an unusual aspect of
Christian truths.

A wonderful passage in the Gospel of Luke describes how an Angel
appeared to the shepherds in the fields and announced to them that the
Saviour of the world was born. Then come the words: 'And suddenly there
was with the Angel a multitude of the heavenly host.' Picture the scene
to yourselves: as the shepherds look upwards the heavens open and the
Beings of the spiritual world are revealed in sublime pictures.

What was the proclamation to the shepherds? It was clothed in momentous
words, words that resounded through the whole of evolution and have
become the Christmas message. Rightly rendered, these words would be as
follows: 'The Divine Beings manifest themselves from on high, that peace
may reign on the Earth below among men who are filled with good will!'
The usual expression, 'glory' is entirely out of place here. The
sentence is correct in the form I have now given, and the contrast
should be clearly emphasized. What the shepherds saw was the
manifestation of spiritual Beings from on high, and the revelation
occurred when it did in order that peace might pour into human hearts
that were filled with a good will. As we shall see, many mysteries of
Christianity are embodied in these words, provided only they are rightly
understood. But certain preliminaries are necessary if light is to be
thrown on this momentous proclamation. Above all we must endeavour to
study the accounts available to clairvoyant faculties from the Akashic
Chronicle. With opened eyes of spirit we must contemplate the epoch when
the Christ Jesus came to humanity, and ask ourselves: What was the
historical background and the source of the spiritual impulse poured
into Earth evolution at that time?

Currents of spiritual life from many different sides converged and
flowed into the evolution of humanity at that point. The very diverse
world-conceptions that had arisen in various regions of the Earth in the
course of the ages converged in Palestine as though into one central
point and came to expression in the events there. We may therefore ask:
What are the sources of these streams?

It was indicated yesterday that in the Gospel of Luke we have the fruits
of Imaginative Cognition, and that this knowledge is gained in the form
of *pictures*. In the events just mentioned a picture is placed before
us of the manifestation to the shepherds of spiritual Beings from on
high: first, the picture is of a spiritual Being, an Angel, who is
followed by a 'heavenly host'. Here we must ask: What does a clairvoyant
initiated into the mysteries of existence see in this picture --- which
he can always evoke again at will --- when he gazes into the Akashic
Chronicle? What was it that was revealed to the shepherds? What was this
angelic host, and whence did it come?

This picture portrays one of the great spiritual streams that flowed
through the process of evolution, gradually rising higher and higher,
until at the time of the events in Palestine its light could shine down
upon the Earth only from spiritual heights. From the angelic host
revealed to the shepherds, we are led back, in deciphering the Akashic
Chronicle, to one of the greatest streams of spiritual life in the
evolution of humanity, a stream which, several centuries before the
coming of Christ, spread far and wide in the form of Buddhism. An
investigator of the Akashic Chronicle who traces back into previous ages
the origin of the revelation to the shepherds, is led, strange as it
will seem to you, to the 'Enlightenment' of the great Buddha. The light
that shone out in India, setting men\'s hearts and minds astir as the
religion of love and compassion, as a great world-conception, and even
to-day is spiritual nourishment for a very large section of humanity ---
that light appeared again in the revelation to the shepherds! For it too
was to stream into the revelation in Palestine. The account given at the
beginning of St. Luke\'s Gospel cannot be understood unless we consider
(again from the vantage-point of spiritual-scientific research) the
significance of Buddha and what his revelation actually brought about in
the course of human evolution.

When Buddha was born in the East, five to six centuries before our era,
there appeared in him an Individuality who had lived many times on Earth
and in the course of his previous incarnations had already reached the
very lofty stage of human development designated by an Oriental
expression as that of a 'Bodhisattva'. Some of you have heard lectures
on different aspects of the nature of the Bodhisattvas. In the
lecture-course [***Spiritual Hierarchies and their Reflection in the
physical
World***](https://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/GA110/English/APC1928/SpiHie_index.html),
given in Düsseldorf some months ago, I spoke of how the Bodhisattvas are
related to the whole of cosmic evolution; in Munich, in the
lecture-course [***The East in the Light of the
West***](https://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/GA113/English/RSPC1940/EasWes_index.html) 
they were referred to from a different point of view. To-day we shall
consider the nature of the Bodhisattvas from still another side and you
will gradually perceive the harmony between the single truths.

He who became a Buddha had first to be a Bodhisattva; individual
development to the rank of Buddhahood is preceded by the stage of
'Bodhisattva'. We will now think of the nature of the Bodhisattvas in
relation to the evolution of humanity considered from the viewpoint of
spiritual science.

The capacities and faculties possessed and developed by human beings in
any particular epoch were not always in existence. To believe that the
same faculties possessed by man to-day were also present in primeval
times is due to incapacity and unwillingness to see beyond the present.
Man\'s faculties, everything he is able to accomplish and know, vary
from epoch to epoch. His faculties to-day are developed to the point
where with his own power of reasoning he is justified in saying: 'I
recognize this or that truth by means of my intelligence and my reason;
I can recognize what is moral or immoral, logical or illogical in a
certain respect. But it would be a mistake to believe that these
capacities for distinguishing the logical from the illogical or the
moral from the immoral, were always to be found in human nature. They
came into existence and developed gradually. What man can accomplish
to-day by means of his *own* capacities, he had at one time to be taught
--- as a child is taught by its parents or teachers --- by Beings who
though incarnated among men were more highly developed by virtue of
their spiritual faculties and could hold converse in the Mysteries with
divine-spiritual Beings even loftier than themselves. Individualities
who, though themselves incarnated in physical bodies, could have
intercourse with still higher, non-incarnated Individualities, existed
at all times. For example, before men acquired the faculty of logical
thinking by means of which they themselves are able to think logically
to-day, they were obliged to learn from certain teachers. These teachers
themselves were not able to think logically through faculties developed
in the physical body itself, but only through their intercourse in the
Mysteries with divine-spiritual Beings in higher realms. Such teachers
proclaimed the principles of logic and morality from revelations they
received from higher worlds in times before men themselves were able,
out of their own earthly nature, to think logically or discover the
principles of morality. The Bodhisattvas are one category of Beings who,
though incarnated in physical bodies, have intercourse with
divine-spiritual Beings in order to bring down and impart to men what
they themselves learn from their divine Teachers. The Bodhisattva is a
Being incarnated in a human body, whose faculties enable him to commune
with divine-spiritual Beings.

Before Gautama Buddha became a 'Buddha', he was a Bodhisattva, that is
to say, an Individuality who, in the Mysteries, was able to commune with
higher, divine-spiritual Beings. In remote, primeval ages of Earth
evolution, a Being such as the Bodhisattva was entrusted in the higher
world with a definite task, a definite mission, which he continues to
discharge.

When the Earth was still in early stages of development, even before the
Atlantean and Lemurian epochs, the Bodhisattva who was incarnated and
became Buddha six hundred years before our era, was assigned a task
which he never abandoned. From epoch to epoch, through every age, his
work was to impart to Earth evolution as much as the beings concerned
enabled it to receive. For each Bodhisattva there comes a time when,
with the mission entrusted to him in the primeval past, he reaches a
definite point --- the point when what he has been able to let flow into
humanity 'from above' can become a faculty of man\'s *own*. A human
faculty to-day was once a faculty of divine-spiritual Beings brought
down to man from spiritual heights by the Bodhisattvas. Hence there
comes a time when a spiritual emissary such as a Bodhisattva can say; 'I
have accomplished my mission. Humanity has now received that for which
it has been prepared through many, many epochs.' Having reached this
point, the Bodhisattva can become 'Buddha'. That is to say, the time has
come when he, as a Being with the particular mission to which I have
referred, need no longer incarnate in a human physical body; he has
incarnated for the last time in such a body and need not incarnate again
as a spiritual emissary in the above sense.

This point of time arrived for Gautama Buddha. The task assigned to him
had led him again and again down to the Earth; but he appeared in his
final incarnation as Bodhisattva when, after his Enlightenment, he
became Buddha. He incarnated in a human body that had developed to the
highest possible stage those faculties which hitherto had had to be
bestowed from above, but were now gradually to become *human* faculties
in the fullest sense. When a Bodhisattva has succeeded through his
foregoing development in making a human body so perfect that it can
itself evolve the faculties connected with his particular mission, he
need not incarnate again. He then hovers in spiritual realms, sending
his influence into humanity, furthering and guiding human affairs.
Henceforth it is the task of men to develop the gifts formerly bestowed
upon them from heavenly heights, saying to themselves: 'We must now
ourselves develop in a way that will further elaborate the faculties
acquired in full measure for the first time in the incarnation when the
Bodhisattva became Buddha.'

When the Being who works through successive epochs as Bodhisattva
appears as one into whose human nature every faculty that previously
flowed down from heavenly heights has been integrated and can now be
expressed through him as an *individual* --- that Being is a 'Buddha'.
All this is revealed by Gautama Buddha. Had he, as Bodhisattva,
withdrawn earlier from his mission, men could no longer have been
blessed by the bestowal of these faculties from on high. But when
evolution had progressed so far that these faculties could be present in
a single human being on Earth, the seed was laid that would enable men
in the future to develop them in their own natures. Thus the
Individuality who, as long as he was a Bodhisattva, did not enter fully
into the human form but towered upwards into heavenly heights --- this
Individuality now for the first time drew completely into human nature
and was fully embodied in that one incarnation. But then he again
withdrew. For with this incarnation as Buddha a certain quotum of
revelations had been given to humanity, thereafter to be developed
further in men themselves. Hence the Bodhisattva, having become Buddha,
might withdraw from the Earth to spiritual heights, might abide there
and guide the affairs of humanity from regions where only a certain
power of clairvoyance is able to behold him.

What, then, was the task of that supremely great Individuality usually
called the 'Buddha'?

If we want to understand the task and mission of this Buddha in the
sense of true esoteriscism, we must realize the following. The cognitive
faculty of mankind has developed gradually. Attention has repeatedly
been drawn to the fact that in the Atlantean epoch a large proportion of
humanity was clairvoyant and able to gaze into the spiritual worlds, and
that certain remnants of this old clairvoyance were still present in
post-Atlantean times. After the Atlantean epoch, in the periods of the
civilizations of ancient India, Persia, Egypt and Chaldea --- even as
late as the Graeco-Latin age --- there were numbers of human beings,
many more than modern man would ever imagine, who possessed the heritage
of this old clairvoyance; the astral plane was open to them and they
could see into the hidden depths of existence. Perception of man\'s
etheric body was quite usual in the Graeco-Latin age; numbers of people
were able to see the human head surrounded by an etheric cloud that has
gradually become entirely concealed within the head. But humanity was to
advance to a form of knowledge acquired through the outer senses and
through the spiritual faculties connected with the senses. Man was
gradually to emerge altogether from the spiritual world and to engage in
pure sense-observation, in intellectual, logical thinking. By degrees he
was to make his way to non-clairvoyant cognition, because he must pass
through this stage in order to regain clairvoyant knowledge in the
future. But such knowledge will then be united with the fruits of
cognition based upon the senses and the intellect.

At the present time we are living in an intermediate period. We look
back to a past when man was clairvoyant, and to a future when this will
again be the case. In our present age the majority of human beings are
dependent upon what they perceive with their senses and grasp with their
intellect. There are, of course, certain heights even in sensory
perception and in knowledge yielded by the intellect and reasoning mind;
everywhere there are 'degrees of knowledge'. One person in a certain
incarnation passes through his existence on Earth with little insight
into what is moral, and little compassion for his fellow-men. We say of
him that he is at a low stage of morality. Another passes through life
with very slightly developed intellectual capacities; we call him a
person of low intelligence. But these powers of intellectual cognition
are capable of rising to a very lofty level. A man whom, in Fichte\'s
sense, we call a 'moral genius' reaches the highest level of moral
Imagination but there are many intermediate stages. Without possessing
clairvoyant faculties we can reach this height only by ennobling powers
that are at the disposal of ordinary humanity. These stages had to be
attained by man in the course of Earth evolution. What man knows to-day
to a certain extent through his own intelligence and also what he
attains through his own moral strength, namely the consciousness that he
must have compassion with the sufferings and sorrows of others --- this
consciousness could not have been acquired by a human being in primeval
times through his own efforts. It can be said to-day that such insight
is unfolded by a healthy moral sense, even without clairvoyance, and to
an increasing extent men will come to realize not only that compassion
is the very highest virtue but that without love humanity can make no
progress.

Man\'s moral sense will grow steadily stronger. But there were epochs in
the past when he would never have understood by himself that compassion
and love belong to a very high stage of development. It was therefore
necessary for spiritual Beings such as the Bodhisattvas to incarnate in
human forms. Revelations of the power of compassion and love came to
such Beings from the higher worlds and they were able to teach men how
to act accordingly. What men have come to recognize to-day through
their *own* powers as the lofty virtues of compassion and love --- this
had to be taught, through epoch after epoch, from heavenly heights.

The Teacher of love and compassion in times when men themselves did not
yet realize the nature of those virtues was the Bodhisattva who
incarnated for the last time as Gautama Buddha. Buddha was formerly the
Bodhisattva, the Teacher of love and compassion. He was the Teacher
throughout the epochs just referred to, when men still possessed a
certain natural clairvoyance. As Bodhisattva he incarnated in bodies
endowed with powers of clairvoyance. Then, when he became Buddha and
looked back into these previous incarnations, he could describe the
experiences of his inmost soul when it gazed into the depths of
existence hidden behind sense-phenomena. He possessed this faculty in
previous embodiments and was born with it into the family of Sakya from
which his father, Suddhodana, descended. When Gautama was born he was
still a Bodhisattva, that is to say he came at the stage of development
reached in his previous incarnations. He who is usually called the
'Buddha' was born to his father Suddhodana and his mother Mayadevi as a
Bodhisattva and possessed the faculty of clairvoyance in a high degree
even as a child. He was always able to gaze into the depths of
existence.

Let us realize that in the course of human evolution this capacity to
gaze into the depths of existence has assumed very definite forms. It
was the mission of humanity in earthly evolution to allow the old, dim
clairvoyance gradually to die away; vestiges that persisted did not,
therefore, retain the best elements of that ancient faculty. The best
elements were the first to be lost. What remained was often a lower form
of vision of the astral world, a vision of those demonic forces which
drag man\'s instincts and passions to a lower level. Through Initiation
we can look into the spiritual world and perceive forces and beings that
are connected with the finest thoughts and sentiments of men, but we
also perceive the spiritual powers behind unbridled passions,
sensuality, consuming egoism. The vestiges of clairvoyance in the
majority of human beings --- it was different, of course, in the
Initiates --- led to vision of these wild, demonic powers behind the
lower human passions. Whoever is able to see into the spiritual world
can of course perceive all this himself; true vision depends upon the
development of human faculties. But the one vision cannot be attained
without the other.

As a Bodhisattva the Buddha had been obliged to incarnate in a body
constituted as other human bodies were at that time. The body in which
he incarnated provided him with the power to look deeply into the astral
substrata of existence and even as a child he was able to perceive all
the astral forces underlying the unbridled passions of men, their
consuming lusts and sensuality. He had been protected from witnessing
physical depravity in the outer world, with its accompanying sufferings
and sorrows. Confined to his father\'s palace, shielded from every
unpleasant experience, he was indulged and pampered in a way considered
fitting for his rank. But this seclusion only enhanced his power of
vision, and while he was carefully protected and everything indicative
of pain and sickness hidden from him, his eyes of spirit were able to
gaze at the astral pictures hovering around him of all the wild,
degrading passions of men. Whoever can read the external biography of
Buddha with genuine esoteric insight will surmise this. It must be
emphasized that in exoteric accounts there is often a great deal that
cannot be understood without knowledge of the esoteric foundations ---
and this applies very particularly to the life of Buddha.

It must seem strange to Orientalists and others who study the life of
Buddha to read that he was surrounded in the palace by 'forty thousand
dancing-girls and eighty-four thousand women'. That statement is to be
found in books sold to-day for a few shillings and the writers are
obviously not particularly astonished at the existence of such a harem!
What is the explanation? It is not realized that this points to the
intensity of the experiences that arose in Buddha through his astral
visions. Guarded from childhood against all knowledge of sorrow and
suffering in the world of physical humanity, he perceived everything as
spiritual forces in the spiritual world. He saw all this because he was
born into a body such as could be produced at that time; but from the
outset he was proof against the delusive pictures around him, having in
his previous incarnations risen to the height of a Bodhisattva. Because
in this incarnation he was living as the Bodhisattva he felt impelled to
go out into the world in order to see the things indicated by the
pictures appearing in the astral world around him in the palace. Every
picture kindled within him an urge to go out and see the world, to leave
his prison. That was the impelling urge in his soul, for as Bodhisattva
there was in him the lofty spiritual power connected with the mission of
imparting to mankind the teaching of compassion and love, with all its
implications. Hence it was necessary for him to become acquainted with
humanity in the world in which man can assimilate this teaching through
moral insight. Buddha was to acquire knowledge of the life of humanity
in the physical world. From Bodhisattva he was to become Buddha --- as a
man among men. The only possibility of achieving this was to abandon all
the faculties that had remained to him from his former incarnations and
to turn outwards to the physical plane in order to live there among men
as a model, an ideal, an example to humanity of the development of these
qualities.

Naturally, many intermediate stages are necessary before an advance from
the stage of Bodhisattva to that of Buddha can be accomplished in this
sense. Such an advance does not take place from one day to the next.

Buddha felt impelled to leave the palace. The story is that on one
occasion he escaped from his royal prison and came across an aged man.
Hitherto he had been surrounded only by the spectacle of exuberant
youth, in order to induce him to believe that nothing else existed. Now,
in the old man, he encountered the phenomenon of advanced age on the
physical plane. Then he came across a sick man; then he saw a corpse ---
the manifestation of death on the physical plane. All this came before
him. The legend --- here once again truer than any external account ---
goes on to relate something very indicative of Buddha\'s essential
nature: that when he left the palace, the horse by which he was drawn
was so saddened by his decision to forsake everything that had
surrounded him since his birth that it died of grief and was transported
as a spiritual being into the spiritual world.
\[ [**2**](https://wn.rsarchive.org/GA/GA0114/19090916p01.html#Note2) \]
--- A profound truth is expressed here. It would lead too far for me to
explain why a horse is taken as a symbol for a spiritual power of man. I
will only remind you of Plato, who speaks of a horse led by a bridle
when he is using a symbol for certain human capacities that are still
bestowed from above and have not been developed by man from his own
inmost self. When Buddha departed from the palace he relinquished these
faculties, left them in the spiritual world whence they had always
guided him. This is indicated in the picture of the horse which dies of
grief and is transported into the spiritual world. But it was only
gradually that Buddha could attain the rank he was destined to reach in
his final incarnation on the Earth. He had first to learn on the
physical plane everything that as Bodhisattva he had known only through
spiritual vision.

To begin with he encountered two teachers, the one an exponent of the
ancient Indian world-conception known as the Sankhya philosophy, the
other an exponent of the Yoga philosophy. Buddha steeped himself in what
they expounded to him. No matter how exalted a being may be, he has to
become acquainted with the external achievements of humanity and
although a Bodhisattva may learn more quickly, he must learn none the
less. If the Bodhisattva who lived six hundred years before our era were
born to-day, he would still, like a child at school, first have to learn
about happenings on Earth while he was still in spiritual heights. It
was essential that Buddha too, should have knowledge of what had been
accomplished since his previous incarnation.

He learnt the principles of the Sankhya philosophy from the one teacher
and of the Yoga philosophy from the other, thereby acquiring a certain
insight into world-conceptions which solved the riddles of life for many
in those days, and into their effect upon the souls of men. In the
Sankhya philosophy he was able to assimilate an intricate system of
logical thought, but the more he familiarized himself with it, the less
did it satisfy him, until finally it seemed to him to be utterly devoid
of life. He realized that he must seek elsewhere than in the traditional
Sankhya philosophy for the sources of what it was his task to achieve in
this incarnation.

The second system was the Yoga philosophy of Patanjali, which sought to
establish connection with the Divine through certain processes in the
life of the soul. Buddha devoted deep study to the Yoga philosophy as
well; he assimilated it, made it part of his very being. But it too left
him unsatisfied, for he perceived that it was something that had simply
been handed down from ancient time. Human beings were meant, however, to
acquire different faculties, to achieve moral development *themselves*.
Having put the Yoga philosophy to the test in his own soul, Buddha
realized that it could not satisfy the needs of his mission.

He then came into the neighbourhood of five ascetics who had striven to
approach the mysteries of existence by the path of severest
self-discipline, mortification and privation. Having tested this path
too, Buddha was again obliged to admit that it would not satisfy the
needs of his mission at that time. For a certain period he underwent all
the privations and mortifications practised by the monks. He starved as
they did, in order to eliminate greed and thereby evoke deeper forces
which come into action when the body is weakened and then, rising up
from the depths of the bodily nature, can lead a man rapidly into the
spiritual world. But the stage of development he had reached enabled
Buddha to perceive the futility of this mortification, fasting and
starvation. Because he was a Bodhisattva, his development in previous
incarnations had enabled him to bring the physical body to the highest
pitch of perfection possible in that age. Hence he could experience what
any man must experience when he takes this particular path into the
spiritual world. Whoever pursues the Sankhya or Yoga philosophy to a
certain point without having developed in himself what Buddha had
previously acquired, whoever aspires to scale the pure heights of Divine
Spirit through logical thinking without having first gained the
requisite moral strength, will be subjected to temptation by the demon
Mara. This ordeal was undergone by Buddha as a test. At this point the
human being is beset by all the devils of pride, vanity and ambition, as
was Buddha when Mara stood before him. But having previously reached the
lofty stage of Bodhisattva, he recognized the demon and was proof
against her. Buddha could say to himself: If men continue to develop
along the old path, without the new impulse contained in the teaching of
compassion and love, they are bound, not being Bodhisattvas, to fall
prey to the demon Mara, who pours all the forces of pride and vanity
into their souls.

This was what Buddha experienced when he had worked through the Sankhya
and Yoga philosophies, following them to their final conclusions. While
he was with the monks, however, he had had an experience in which the
demon assumed a different form, one in which he arrays before the human
being an abundance of external, physical possessions --- 'the kingdoms
of the world and the glory of them' --- in order to divert him from the
spiritual world. Buddha found that this temptation comes precisely on
the path of mortification, for the demon Mara approached him, saying:
'Be not misled into abandoning everything that was yours as a king\'s
son; return to the royal palace!' Another man would have yielded to what
was then presented to him, but Buddha\'s development was such that he
could see through the tempter and his aim, could perceive what would
befall humanity if men lived on as hitherto and chose the path of hunger
and mortification as the only means of ascent into the spiritual world.
Being himself proof against this temptation he could disclose to men the
great danger that would threaten them if they chose to penetrate into
the spiritual world simply by means of fasting and external measures of
the kind, without the foundation of an active moral sense.

Thus while still a Bodhisattva, Buddha had advanced to those two
boundary-points in development which a man who is not a Bodhisattva had
better avoid altogether. Translating this into words of ordinary
parlance, we may say: 'The highest knowledge is full of glory and of
beauty. But see that you approach this knowledge with a clean heart,
noble purpose and purified soul --- otherwise the devil of pride, vanity
and ambition will seize you!' The second teaching is this: 'Strive not
to enter the spiritual world by any external path, through mortification
or fasting, until you have purified your moral sense --- otherwise the
tempter will approach you from the other side!' --- These are the two
teachings whose light shines from Buddha into our own age. While still a
Bodhisattva he revealed the essential purpose of his mission --- which
was to impart the moral sense to humanity in an age when men were not
yet capable of unfolding it out of their own hearts. Thus when he
realized the dangers of asceticism for mankind he left the five monks
and went to a place where, by an intense deepening of those faculties of
human nature which can be developed without the old clairvoyance,
without any capacity inherited from earlier times, he achieved the
highest perfection that it will ever be possible for mankind to achieve
by means of these faculties.

In the twenty-ninth year of his life, after having abandoned the path of
asceticism, there dawned upon Buddha during his seven days of meditation
under the 'Bodhi-tree' the great Truths that can flash up in a man when,
in deep contemplation, he strives to discover what his own faculties can
impart to him. There dawned upon Buddha the great teachings he then
proclaimed as the *Four Truths* and the doctrine of compassion and love
presented as the *Eightfold Path*. We shall be considering these
teachings of Buddha later on. At the moment it will be sufficient to say
that they are a kind of portrayal of the moral sense and of the purest
doctrine of compassion and love. They arose when, under the
'Bodhi-tree', the Bodhisattva of India became Buddha. The teaching of
compassion and love came into existence then for the first time in the
history of mankind in the form of *human faculties* which man has since
been able to develop from his own very self. That is the essential
point. Therefore shortly before his death Buddha said to his disciples:
'Grieve not that the Master is departing. I am leaving with you the Law
of Wisdom and the Law of Discipline. For the future they will serve as
substitutes for the Master.' These words mean simply: Hitherto
the *Bodhisattva* has taught you what is expressed in the Law; now,
having fulfilled his incarnation on Earth, he may withdraw. For men will
absorb into their own hearts the teaching of the Bodhisattva and from
their own hearts will be able to develop this teaching as the religion
of compassion and love. That was what came to pass in India when, after
seven days of inner contemplation, the Bodhisattva became Buddha; and
that was what he taught in diverse forms to the pupils who were around
him. The actual forms in which he gave his teaching will still have to
be considered.

It was necessary for us to-day to look back to what happened six hundred
years before our era because we shall neither understand the path of
Christianity nor what is indicated about that path, above all by the
writer of the Gospel of Luke, unless we follow evolution backwards from
the events in Palestine to the Sermon at Benares. Since Buddha attained
that rank there was no need for him to return to the Earth; since then
he has been a spiritual Being, living in the spiritual world and
participating in everything that has transpired on Earth. When the
greatest of all happenings on the Earth was about to come to pass, there
appeared to the shepherds in the fields a Being from spiritual heights
who made the proclamation recorded in the Gospel of St. Luke. Then,
together with the Angel, there suddenly appeared a 'heavenly host'. The
'heavenly host' was the picture of the *glorified Buddha*, seen by the
shepherds in vision; he was the Bodhisattva of ancient times, the Being
in his spiritual form who for thousands and thousands of years had
brought to men the message of compassion and love. Now, after his last
incarnation on the Earth, he soared in spiritual heights and appeared to
the shepherds together with the Angel who had announced to them the
Event of Palestine.

These are the findings of spiritual investigation. It was the
Bodhisattva of old who now, in the glory of Buddhahood, appeared to the
shepherds. From the Akashic Chronicle we learn that in Palestine, in the
'City of David', a child was born to parents descended from the priestly
line of the House of David. This child --- I say it with emphasis ---
born of parents of whom the father at any rate was descended from the
priestly line of the House of David, was to be shone upon from the very
day of birth by the power radiating from Buddha in the spiritual world.
We look with the shepherds into the manger where 'Jesus of Nazareth', as
he is usually called, was born, and see the radiance above the little
child; we know that in this picture is expressed the power of the
Bodhisattva who became Buddha --- the power that had formerly streamed
to men and, working now upon humanity from the spiritual world,
accomplished its greatest deed by shedding its lustre upon the child
born at Bethlehem.

When the Individuality whose power now rayed down from spiritual heights
upon the child of parents belonging to David\'s line was born in India
long ago --- when the Buddha to be was born as Bodhisattva --- the whole
momentous significance of the events described to-day was revealed to a
sage living at that time, and what he beheld in the spiritual world
caused that sage --- Asita was his name --- to go to the royal palace to
look for the little Bodhisattva-child. When he saw the babe he foretold
his mighty mission as Buddha, predicting, to the father\'s dismay, that
the child would not rule over his kingdom, but would become a Buddha.
Then Asita began to weep, and when asked whether misfortune threatened
the child, he answered: 'No, I am weeping because I am so old that I
shall not live to see the day when this Saviour, the Bodhisattva, will
walk the Earth as Buddha!' Asita did not live to see the Bodhisattva
become Buddha and there was good reason for his grief at that time. But
the same Asita who had seen the Bodhisattva as a babe in the palace of
King Suddhodana, was born again as the personality who, in the Gospel of
Luke, is referred to as Simeon in the scene of the presentation in the
temple. We are told that Simeon was inspired by the Spirit to go into
the temple where the child was brought to him ([**Luke II,
25--32**](javascript:void(0);)). Simeon was the same being who, as
Asita, had wept because in that incarnation he would not be able to see
the Bodhisattva attaining Buddhahood. But it was granted to him to
witness the further stage in the development of this Individuality, and
having 'the Holy Spirit upon him' he was able to perceive, at the
presentation in the temple, the radiance of the glorified Bodhisattva
above the head of the Jesus-child of the House of David. Then he could
say to himself: 'Now you need no longer grieve, for what you did not
live to see at that earlier time, you now behold: the glory of the
Saviour shining above this babe. Lord, now let thy servant die in
peace!'
