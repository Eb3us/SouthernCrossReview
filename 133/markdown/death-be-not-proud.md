# Death, be not proud\
### or\
### Life after the Coronavirus

![Art by William Blake](blake.jpg){class="alarge"}


**Death, be not proud**, *though some have called thee\
Mighty and dreadful, for thou art not so;\
For those whom thou think\'st thou dost overthrow\
Die not, poor Death, nor yet canst thou kill me.\
From rest and sleep, which but thy pictures be,\
Much pleasure; then from thee much more must flow,\
And soonest our best men with thee do go,\
Rest of their bones, and soul\'s delivery.\
Thou art slave to fate, chance, kings, and desperate men,\
And dost with poison, war, and sickness dwell,\
And poppy or charms can make us sleep as well\
And better than thy stroke; why swell\'st thou then?\
One short sleep past, we wake eternally\
And death shall be no more; Death, thou shalt die.*
John Donne

As I write this, the coronavirus (Covid-19) is still raging around the
world, in some countries more, in others less. It is especially
appreciated by the media, who have a subject with unequaled talent for
growing their ratings and the subsequent sales of the products their
advertisers are selling. And the so called "social" media, with its menu
of facts and lies, couldn\'t be happier. The disease is said to be fatal
to humankind, of which we all are members, ergo any one of us, or all of
us could be gasping for oxygen unto death at any moment. Mostly,
however, we forget that even if we are unlikely victims of death from
the virus, we are going to die anyway, sooner or later. But I\'m jumping
ahead.

We all know, theoretically, that we will die at some point in time. I
say "theoretically" because we don\'t *really *believe it until at least
the average milestone in life has been reached -- around 42 years,
unless, of course, serious illness or a life threatening accident has
brought the milestone closer. (It was generally agreed that Derek Jeter
was too old at 39 to keep playing shortstop for the New York Yankees,
and he agreed.) If we wish to follow the seven-year-itch model, man
reaches his physical prime between 21 and 28. Beyond that, if he is
engaged in a strenuous physical activity requiring a high level of
accuracy, he will notice a lessening of accuracy and an increase in the
amount of energy required to achieve the same result as before. At 42
the downward slope of mortality becomes shockingly evident, which is why
the necessity for eyeglasses is avoided by holding the page farther away
until the truth can no longer be denied.

The existential question: "Why am I here?" hits you like a sharp left to
the jaw. You don\'t know the answer, so it\'s best to ignore it: Why
worry about something you can do nothing about? But something has
changed. Maybe it\'s time to change spouses, buy that motorcycle you\'ve
always wanted, grow a beard. Or, best of all, chuck everything over the
edge and go to Costa Rica or India -- if you haven\'t already done some
of those things at a young age when they were applicable. Often,
however, releasing these safety valves isn\'t practical because of
family responsibilities -- especially children -- career ambition, or
just plain fear, all leading to remorse and, in the worst of cases,
despair. The greatest remorse, after all, is for the sins not committed.

To keep to the title\'s point, we must first define what we mean by
"death". When we die we are dead. Right? Maybe wrong. It depends on
whether we consider ourselves to be exclusively physical beings. Then
yes, when we die, which, remember, we inevitably will, we are
dead\...period. But if we also have a soul and/or spirit, the question
becomes quite a bit more complicated, for we must then ask if, when the
physical body dies, the soul and/or spirit also dies.

There is ample evidence that the physical body exists. Don\'t smirk.
Certain philosophers and mystics have affirmed that it\'s all an
illusion, "maya". Rene Descartes postulated the contrary: "I think,
therefore I exist." Samuel Johnson, annoyed at Berkeley for claiming
that physical objects don\'t exist when not observed, kicked a large
stone and said, \"I retort it thus!\" With or without such great minds,
we can be pretty sure that the physical body exists. We can see it, feel
it, suffer from its illnesses or because it doesn\'t always do what we
want or even *be* what we want. We can\'t all be quarterbacks for the
New England Patriots or shortstops for the New York Yankees.

There\'s a guy I see occasionally on TV. He\'s an astrophysicist with an
imposing name: Neil deGrasse Tyson and he\'s the director of New York\'s
Hayden Planetarium. A cool expert if there ever was one. His job
basically is to explain cosmology in layman\'s uncomplicated terms. The
last time I saw him the host of the TV program, Bill Maher, asked, when
Tyson had finished explaining the universe in five minutes, "And it\'s
random, right?" Tyson smiled as though conversing with a child, "Yes,
it\'s random." If I had been there, I\'d have asked him how he knows
it\'s random. But Bill Maher, a professional atheistic comedian, just
smiled, because it was what he wanted to hear. This, coming from the
mouth of a famous astrophysicist, was evidence enough for him.

But not for me, no sir. You see, that astrophysicist knows a lot more
than I do about the mechanics of the universe, the speed and density and
size of the planets and other heavenly bodies, but that doesn\'t mean he
knows the why of the cosmos or how it all began. So in respect to this
question he is a over-educated ignoramus, just as Bill Maher is a very
funny, over-egotistical comedian.

Within this universe, within this solar system, on this planet earth we
human beings live an average of 75 years or so if all goes well, which
it often doesn\'t. Such a short visit, considering the universe\'s age
and how long humans have been around, is no big deal. Is such a
comparative speck in time and space worth it? We seem to think so, or we
wouldn\'t hang around even as long as we do.

According to the Buddha, Kierkegaard and even Shakespeare, life is full
of the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. But, as even they would
admit, life may also experience moments of love and happiness.

Most of us experience moments or periods of depression, some more than
others, with or without reason. An effective antidote for melancholy is
to think about how much better off you are than so many others who are
suffering from war, violence, hunger, fear, illness, and so on. To be
despondent about what others suffer is at least not egotistic, except
for that queer feeling of relief that it isn\'t me.

The Danish philosopher Soren Kierkegaard (1813 - 1855) argued that
because the amount of suffering outweighs the amount of happiness, the
true philosopher, who must always act logically, should commit suicide.
Every man or woman comes to a crossroads in life, or rather a fork in
his path. The path to the left, that the physical body is all the human
being is and the physical world is the only world, is the path of
hopelessness. The path to the right is the path of hope. The traveler
must choose. He would be a poor philosopher if he chose the left path,
for it can only lead to despair. The right hand path at least offers
something, if not certainty. So the thinking person must choose it.
Along the way he will find faith, which will reward him for having
chosen the right way. (This is not a quote, only a personal remembrance
of the author\'s general intention as described in one of his books,
possibly "Fear and Trembling".) It worked for Kierkegaard, according to
him. He was a dedicated Christian, though very critical of the Danish
Lutheran Church. He asks ironically:

Where am I? Who am I?\
How did I come to be here?\
What is this thing called the world?\
How did I come into the world?\
Why was I not consulted?\
And If I am compelled to take part in it, where is the director?\
I want to see him.

He is considered to be the founder of existentialism. There are several
philosophical positions related to existential philosophy, but in
general it proposes that man exists and in that existence he defines
himself and the world in his own subjectivity, and wanders between
choice, freedom, and existential angst. Nevertheless, Kierkegaard\'s
existentialism was quite different from that of the modern
existentialists -- Sartre, Camus, et al, who were atheists implying that
life is hopelessly absurd, whereas K decided that hope and faith *could
*lead* *to certainty, so it is logical to at least try it. But faith in
what? For K it was Christ. For the modern existentialists this avenue is
closed by a flashing red light, so they are left with their existential
angst, existing, doing the good, or not.

When I was a child having my brain washed by Catholic priests and nuns,
to the question "Why am I here?", the catechism taught: "to know, love
and serve God," which has its own logic. To serve someone or something
one should love it; to love it one should know it. But how, in God\'s
name, are we to know God? "God" is a vague notion, once we slough off
the Santa Claus image. So let\'s start with something tangible: nature.
Nature is beautiful, good and wise. It exists on its own, not man-made
like a bridge, a building or the internet. Nature does more than exist;
it *lives. *Well, maybe it\'s not always good. "Nature is red in tooth
and claw," Tennyson said, and he had a point. And there are natural
disasters like earthquakes and tsunamis and viruses that kill a lot of
innocent people. Ah yes, the suffering of the innocents! How do we
explain it? It\'s one reason why the modern existentialists are
atheists: A good God would not permit such suffering, and we don\'t want
to know about an evil God. But what if there is one? But what if there
are both -- good and evil gods? In Dostoevsky\'s *The Brothers
Karamazov* Ivan, the eldest brother, observes the suffering of the
children of his time and place. As a result, although he doesn\'t deny
God\'s existence, he rejects Him as unjust and cruel. There must be
something else involved; there must be some other explanation. If not,
the absurdists are right, And we don\'t think they are. That other
explanation is reincarnation and karma. More on that later.

Does death really exist, or is it an ignorant invention of mankind?
M[]{#anchor}an is the only creature who could ask that question. You
might well object that the idea is ridiculous because we see death every
day. And even if we don\'t actually *see* it (leave that to the
hospitals and morticians), we know of relatives, friends, acquaintances
who were here yesterday and aren\'t here today. So yes, everything that
lives, dies. It is the inescapable condition, the fine print in the
contract of life. We see it or we know about it, but we don\'t
*experience* it. If we did we wouldn\'t be around talking about it. We
have the best-selling near-death experiences, sure. I don\'t doubt that
they are true, but those who report them are honest enough to describe
them as "near-death". No one has actually returned from *total* death --
except perhaps Jesus of Nazareth, and who knows what his resurrection
really means. According to Rudolf Steiner it was a kind of spiritual
(etheric) resurrection, which only the disciples were able to witness.

We can be certain that every living physical organism will
die\...physically. If, however, a spiritual world also exists alongside,
beyond or within the physical one, and if we can accept the existence of
that world at least as an hypothesis, then we have already taken the
first step on an existential path that does not depend on faith, and is
different from that other path, a surrender to atheistic nihilism. It is
the middle way -- always the best way -- which at first nods to the
spirit, greets it as an old friend whom we\'ve lost track of. "Hi there,
long time no see. My intuition tells me you\'re back."

The first signpost along this path indicates that although the physical
body dies, the spirit that energized it does not. It returns to that
other world, the one from which it originally sprang, one which it had
never completely abandoned. The fact that we are thinking it is of
itself evidence of the spiritual world\'s existence, for thinking is a
spiritual activity, the brain being the necessary physical instrument to
enable thinking during physical life. According to this way of seeing
things, the brain does not think; it reproduces the thoughts of
thinking, similar to the way a guitar, or other musical instrument,
produces the sound of music.

**Knowledge and Consciousness**

That some people know more than others is true, but all humans know more
than all animals. Why, then, are bees so intelligent, or dolphins or
whales, or cats? Such intelligence is instinctive, therefore not
learnable as reading and writing are. Young birds don\'t really learn
from their parents, they are only protected and helped along in order
that their instinct may develop. I know that I know; I also know that I
know not. No animal, though conscious, has that ability, also known as
thinking. The vegetable kingdom is imbued with enormous intelligence and
beauty. Plant intelligence, however, not only is not thinking; it\'s not
even truly conscious. Yet it exists. One level of being is always more
consciously intelligent than others: we know more than elephants,
elephants know more than trees, trees know more than rocks. In other
words, human consciousness made an existential leap at some point in
evolution, whereas animal consciousness reached a dead-end.

Is the human being then the highest level, the epitome of being,
all-knowing? If, as the experts claim, the cosmos is random, then the
answer is yes, for then no higher level or form of being exists. And no
higher level of consciousness and knowledge exists. This means that the
animal\'s intelligent instinct is also random. But instinct is not
random. It follows stringent rules. Intelligence is also not random.
Random is chaos, intelligence is form. In order for intelligence,
whether instinctive or thinking, to exist, there must also exist a being
or beings who possess it. And to know that intelligence exists, thinking
is required. And the only being who can think is the human being. But
wait! Human beings are not all-knowing, not by a long shot. Certain
scientists think that it\'s merely a matter of time before we are able
to know everything. But if it\'s all only random, what else is there to
know? Only details. The essential, existential questions remain
unanswered evermore. Higher knowledge, then, must exist, but it can only
be possessed by higher beings, sometimes known as God, gods, angels,
whatever. Or, perhaps, by certain exceptional human beings.

According to Rudolf Steiner, the earth is a cosmos of wisdom: nature is
wise, everything fits, the sun will rise tomorrow as it has since the
beginning of time. In fact, if we hadn\'t had the days to count,
there\'d be no time. The earth\'s mission, meaning humanity\'s goal on
earth, is to transform this cosmos of wisdom into a cosmos of love.

We are far from achieving this goal, that\'s for sure. And there\'s no
guarantee that we will be able to do so. The first step is achieving
freedom, for without freedom real love is not possible -- it is a
prerequisite. Freedom of the spirit. The physical body cannot be free;
it is constrained by its own needs from within and from without. The
spirit\'s constraints are self-imposed and thus subject to release. The
spirit\'s strongest weapon is thinking, a spiritual activity which can
lead to freedom, and then, in time and through much effort, to love - a
form of greatly enhanced feeling.

**Reincarnation and Karma**

The length of time and the amount of effort required to accomplish this
transformation of the earth is not sufficient in one lifetime.
Therefore, logically, more than one life, many lives, are necessary to
reach the finish line: love.

Reincarnation and karma (or destiny) are also, luckily, logical: if so
much time and effort is needed, then the only way is many lives. Ah, one
could object: although individuals die, their descendants live on and
could continue the work. Certainly, but who are these descendants and
where do they come from? Do they pop out of mother\'s womb ready-made,
like Barbies? Or do they also have long, many-lived biographies, and
loaded down -- or up -- with karmic baggage?

Nowadays ecological awareness has awakened. Humanity is responsible, for
example, for global warming, and through it and other destructive
actions, such as atomic weapons, the potential destruction of the earth
itself or at least its human and animal inhabitants. Consciously or
unconsciously we could feel: So what? I\'ll be long gone by then. But if
reincarnation is a fact, then saving and protecting the planet is for
our own benefit in future lives. An egocentric concept? Perhaps, but
also practical and logical. So I won\'t take it back.

This leads to thoughts about the present. Although good things do
happen, progress is slow, so slow that most of us will almost certainly
not see much of it during this lifetime. Young people are often cynical
about the possibility of real change. Here I\'d like to quote one of the
last things Bernard Lievegoed, a Dutch anthroposophist, psychiatrist and
educator, said:

It is not yet the time for reaping! It is the time to plant seeds, which
will bear fruit in a future time.

Patience is the watchword, to live with questions and wait for the
moment when the answer will come from the spiritual world. It is only by
planting seeds today that a better world can be possible in the future.
So what is done well today, even if it seems to have had little effect
or is a failure according to the usual standards, is well worth doing.
The secret is not to be despondent or surrender to failure; sooner of
later the seeds will sprout.

Recently a friend, a medical doctor, confided in me that he suffered
from thanatophobia (phobic fear of death) and it was *killing* him.
Thanatos is the god of death in Greek mythology, so the label is spot
on. Whether his condition is a true phobia causing pain and illness or a
passing anxiety attack related to a weak heart, I cannot judge. But it
seems to me that he and many others like him would do well to convince
themselves that death is a door to a new act of existence. In every good
play the lights go down at the end of each act and come up again at the
beginning of every new one. We may not be the lighting technician or the
director, yet, but we certainly are the principal actors. My doctor
friend, since deceased, may be already rehearsing.

I think that the fear of death, thanatophobia, is really the fear of
non-existence, something practically inconceivable, more threatening by
far than death itself. Existence is mine; how dare you take it from me,
Thanatos? But this inflates the angel of death enormously. He/she cannot
take away anyone\'s existence. The curtain rises inexorably upon the
next act, and "the play\'s the thing". So death, be not proud. I fear
you not.
