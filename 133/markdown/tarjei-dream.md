# The Trump-Pill

I almost forgot: I had a dream about Donald Trump when I woke up this
morning. Or was it yesterday morning? It just so happens that I had a
couple of bad falls in a parking lot a couple of weeks ago and cracked a
rib and also hurt my jaw because I fell flat on my face, nose bleeding
and black eye. The rib is OK now, but the jaw still hurts sometimes when
I've been lying for hours on the left side, because then it combines
with a headache and I have to get up and eat some painkillers.

Other people write about such stuff on Facebook constantly. I don't, but
this involves a dream about Trump, so bear with me.

So I was half awake and half asleep and in pain, thinking about taking
pills. And in the dream, Trump was passing out some white oblong pills,
not only to me, but to all the voters. I don't vote in America \[Tarjei
lives in Norway\], but this was a dream. As it turned out, they were
poisonous pills that knocked you out or killed you, like a Jim Jones
Kool Aid sort of thing, and he told everybody that this was how to vote
this year, by eating his pills. The pills were the ballots and they had
to be eaten, and they were likely to kill you. Then I woke up and ate
some pills that did me some good instead, but it was very creepy so no
wonder I forgot it. If anyone would like to interpret this dream, go
ahead.
