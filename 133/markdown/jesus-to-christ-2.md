### Lecture Two

Karlsruhe, October 6, 1911 -- GA 131

Yesterday I tried to give you a picture of a form of Initiation
which ought not to exist, according to our valuation of human
nature. This Initiation, as we have seen it in Jesuitism, leads to
the acquisition of certain occult faculties, but if we bring a
cleansed and purified occult vision to bear upon these faculties,
they cannot be considered good. It will now be my task to show that
the Rosicrucian way is characterised by all that high regard for
human nature which we recognise as equally our own. But we must
first be clear on certain points.

From explanations given previously in various forms, we know that
the Rosicrucian Initiation is essentially a development of the
Christian Initiation, so that we can speak of it as a
Christian-Rosicrucian Initiation. In earlier lecture-courses the
purely Christian Initiation; with its seven degrees, and the
Rosicrucian Initiation, also with seven degrees, have been compared.
But now we must note that with regard to Initiation the principle of
the progress of the human soul must be strictly maintained.

We know that the Rosicrucian Initiation had its proper beginning
somewhere about the thirteenth century. At that time it was
recognised by those individualities who have to guide the deeper
destinies of human evolution as the right Initiation for the more
advanced human souls. This shows that the Initiation of the
Rose-Cross takes full account of the continuous progress of the
human soul and must therefore pay particular attention to the fact
that since the thirteenth century the human soul has developed
further. Souls which are to be led to Initiation in our day can no
longer adopt the standpoint of the thirteenth century. I want
especially to point this out because in our time there is such a
strong desire to label everything with some catchword. From this bad
habit, and not for any justified reason, our anthroposophical
movement has been given a label which could lead gradually to
something like a calamity.

It is true that within our movement the principle of Rosicrucianism
can be found in all completeness, so that we can penetrate into the
sources of Rosicrucianism. So it is that persons who by means of our
anthroposophical training penetrate into these sources can properly
call themselves Rosicrucians. But it must be emphasised just as
strongly that outsiders have no right to designate as Rosicrucian
the anthroposophical stream we represent, simply because our
movement has been given --- consciously or unconsciously --- an
entirely false label. We are no longer standing where the
Rosicrucians stood in the thirteenth century and on through the
following centuries, for we take into account the progress of the
human soul. Hence the way indicated in my book, [***Knowledge of the
Higher Worlds***](https://www.rsarchive.org/Books/GA010/), as the
way best adapted for gaining access to the Higher Worlds must not
without further explanation be equated with what may be called the
Rosicrucian way. Through our movement we can penetrate into true
Rosicrucianism, but our movement extends over a far wider domain,
for it embraces the whole of Theosophy; hence it should not be
labeled Rosicrucian. Our movement must be described simply as the
spiritual science of today, the anthroposophical spiritual science
of the twentieth century. Outsiders, particularly, will fall ---
more or less unconsciously --- into some kind of misunderstanding if
they describe our movement simply as Rosicrucian. But an outstanding
achievement of Rosicrucianism since the dawn of modern spiritual
life in the thirteenth century has been to establish a rule which
must also be ours: the rule that all modern Initiation in the
deepest sense of the word must recognise and treasure the
independence of the most holy element in man\'s inner life, his
Will-centre, as indicated yesterday. The occult methods there
described are designed to overcome and enslave the human will and to
set it on a predetermined course; hence a true occultism will
rigorously avoid them.

Before characterising Rosicrucianism and present-day Initiation, we
must mention a decisively relevant point: the Rosicrucianism of the
thirteenth, fourteenth and even of the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries has again had to be modified for our time. The
Rosicrucianism of those earlier centuries could not reckon with a
spiritual element which has since entered into human evolution.
Without this element today we can no longer understand rightly the
fundamentals of all those spiritual streams which arise from the
ground of occultism, including therefore any theosophical stream.
For reasons we shall see more exactly in the course of these
lectures, the teaching of reincarnation and karma, of repeated
earth-lives, was excluded for many centuries from the external,
exoteric teachings of Christianity. In the thirteenth century the
teaching of reincarnation and karma had not yet entered, in the
highest sense, into the first stages of Rosicrucian initiation. One
could go far, up to the fourth or fifth degree; one could go through
what was called the Rosicrucian studium --- the acquiring of
Imagination, the reading of the occult script, the finding of the
philosopher\'s stone --- and one could experience something of what
is called the mystical death. One could reach this stage and acquire
exceptionally high secret knowledge, but without needing to achieve
full clarity concerning the illuminating teachings of reincarnation
and karma.

We must be clear that human thinking progresses and now embraces
forms of thought which, if only we follow them out logically --- and
this can easily be done on the external, exoteric level --- lead
unconditionally to a recognition of repeated earth-lives and so to
the idea of karma. The words spoken through the lips of Strader in
my second Rosicrucian drama, *The Soul\'s Probation*, are absolutely
true: namely that a logical thinker today, if he is not to break
with everything that the thought-forms of the last century have
brought in, must come finally to a recognition of karma and
reincarnation.

This is something deeply rooted in present-day spiritual life. Just
because this knowledge has been slowly prepared and has these deep
roots, it emerges little by little, as though independently, in the
West. It is indeed remarkable how the necessity of recognising
repeated earth-lives has independently made itself felt --- though
certainly only by outstanding individual thinkers. We need only call
attention to certain facts which are quite forgotten, intentionally
or unintentionally, in our present-day literature. Take, for
example, what comes out so wonderfully in Lessing\'s *Education of
the Human Race*. We see how Lessing, that great mind of the
eighteenth century who at the zenith of his life gathered up his
thoughts and wrote the *Education of the Human Race*, came as though
by inspiration to the thought of repeated earth-lives. So does the
idea of repeated earth-lives find its way, as though by inner
necessity, into modern life. It has to be taken into consideration,
but certainly not in the way that ideas of this kind are considered
in our history books or in cultured circles nowadays. For in such
cases resort is had to the familiar formula that when a clever man
grows old, excuses must be made for him. So it is said that although
we may appreciate Lessing in his earlier works, we must allow that
in later years, when he came to the idea of repeated earth-lives, he
had become somewhat feeble.

In more recent times the idea occurs sporadically. Drossbach, a
nineteenth-century psychologist, spoke of it in the only way then
possible. Without occultism, simply by observing nature, he tried in
his own way as a psychologist to establish the idea of repeated
earth-lives. Again, in the middle of the last century, a small
society offered a prize for the best essay on the immortality of the
soul. This was a remarkable occurrence in German spiritual life, and
is very little known. Moreover, the prize went to an essay by
Wiedenmann which tried to prove the immortality of the soul in the
sense of repeated earth-lives: certainly an imperfect attempt, but
it could not be otherwise in the fifties of the last century, when
the necessary thought-forms had not developed far enough. One could
quote various other instances where the idea of repeated earth-lives
springs up, as though in response to a postulate, a demand, of the
nineteenth century. Hence in my little book, [***Reincarnation and
Karma***](https:
//wn.rsarchive.org/Articles/GA034/English/AP1962/ReKarm_index.html),
and also in my
book, [***Theosophy***](https://www.rsarchive.org/Books/GA009/), the
ideas of repeated earth-lives and of karma could be worked out in
relation to the thought-forms of natural science, but with reference
to human individuality in contrast to the animal species.

We must, however, be clear on one essential point: there is an
immense difference between the way in which Western men have come to
this idea simply through thinking, and the way in which it figures
in Buddhism, for instance. It is most interesting to see how Lessing
came to the idea of repeated earth-lives. The result can of course
be compared with the idea of repeated earth-lives in Buddhism, and
even given the same name; but the way taken by Lessing is very
different and is not generally known. How did he come to this idea?

We can see this quite clearly if we go through the *Education of the
Human Race*. There is no doubt that human evolution gives evidence
of progress in the strictest sense. Lessing argued that this
progress is an education of humanity by the Divine Powers. God gave
into men\'s hands a first elementary book, the Old Testament.
Thereby a certain stage of evolution was achieved. When the human
race had gone further, it was given the second elementary book, the
New Testament. And then Lessing sees in our time something that goes
beyond the New Testament: an independent feeling in the human soul
for the true, the good, and the beautiful. This marks for him a
third stage in the education of the human race. The thought of the
education of mankind by the Divine Powers is worked out in a lofty
style.

Lessing then asks himself: What is the one and only way to explain
this progress? He cannot explain it otherwise than by allowing every
soul to participate in each epoch of human evolution, if human
progress is to have any meaning at all. For it would have no meaning
if one soul lived only in the epoch of Old Testament civilisation
and another soul only in the New Testament epoch. It has meaning
only if souls are taken through all the epochs of civilisation and
share in all the stages of human education. In other words, if the
soul lives through repeated earth-lives, the progressive education
of the human race makes good sense. So the idea of repeated
earth-lives springs up in Lessing\'s mind as something that belongs
to human destiny.

In a deeper sense the following underlies his thinking. If a soul
was incarnated at the time of the Old Testament, it took into itself
whatever it could take; when it reappears in a later time it carries
the fruits of its previous life into the next life, and the fruits
of that life into the one following, and so on. Thus the successive
stages of evolution are interlocked. And whatever a soul achieves is
achieved not only for itself, but for all mankind. Humanity is a
great organism, and for Lessing reincarnation is necessary in order
that the whole human race can progress. Thus it is historical
evolution, the concern of humanity as a whole, that he takes as his
starting-point, and from there he is impelled to a recognition of
reincarnation.

It is different if we trace out the same idea in Buddhism. There, a
person is concerned merely with himself, with his own psyche. The
individual says to himself: I am placed in the world of maya; desire
brought me into it, and in the course of repeated incarnations I
shall free myself as an individual soul from the necessity of living
again on earth. This applies to the single individual; all the
attention is centred on him. That is the great difference.

Whether a person looks at the process from within, as in Buddhism,
or from without, as Lessing does, his gaze takes in the whole of
human evolution. In both cases the same idea emerges, but in the
West the path to it is quite different. While the Buddhist limits
himself to concern for the individual, the man of the West is
concerned with the whole of humanity. He feels himself bound up with
all men as a single organism.

What is it that has taught Western man the necessity of realising,
above all, that his concern is with all mankind? The reason is that
into the sphere of the heart, into his world of feeling, he has
received the words of Christ Jesus concerning human brotherhood:
that it is beyond all nationality, beyond all racial
characteristics, and that humanity is a great organism.

Hence it is interesting to see how Drossbach, although his thinking
is still imperfect, because the scientific ideas of the first half
of the nineteenth century had not yet produced the corresponding
thought-forms, does not take the Buddhistic path, but a universal
cosmic one. Drossbach starts from the thoughts of natural science
and observes the soul in its cosmic aspect. He cannot think
otherwise of the soul than as a seed which goes through an external
form and reappears in other external forms, and so is reincarnated.
With him, this idea turns into fantasy, for he thinks that the world
itself must be transformed, whereas Lessing thought correctly of
short periods of time. Wiedenmann, too, in his prize essay, brings
the immortality of the soul into logical connection with the
question of reincarnation.

So we see that these ideas appear quite sporadically, and it is
right that in spite of faulty modes of thinking they should spring
up in minds such as these, and in others also. The great
evolutionary change which the human soul has undergone from the
eighteenth to the twentieth century is such that everyone today who
begins the study of world progress must above all assimilate those
thought-forms which lead quite naturally to the acceptance and
making credible of the ideas of reincarnation and karma. Between the
thirteenth and eighteenth centuries human thought was not
sufficiently advanced to come by itself to a recognition of
reincarnation. One has always to start from the stage reached by the
most highly developed thought of the period. Today the starting
point must be that form of thinking which, on the basis of natural
science, regards the idea of repeated earth-lives as logical ---
which means hypothetically true. So do the times advance.

Without describing the Rosicrucian path in detail today, we will
bring out what is essential both to it and to the way of knowledge
at the present time. The characteristic of both is that everyone who
gives advice and guidance for Initiation will value in the deepest
sense the independence and inviolability of the sphere of the human
Will. Hence the essential point is that through a special kind of
moral and spiritual culture the ordinary interweaving of the
physical body, etheric body, astral body, and I must be changed. And
those directions which are given for the training of the moral
feelings, as also those for concentration in thinking, for
meditation --- all this makes finally for the one goal of loosening
the spiritual texture which binds together the physical and etheric
bodies, so that the etheric body does not remain so firmly fitted
into the physical body as it naturally is. All the exercises strive
after this lifting out, this loosening, of the etheric body. Thereby
another union between the astral body and the etheric body is
brought about. It is because in ordinary life the etheric body and
the physical body are so firmly united that the astral body cannot
normally feel or experience what is going on in the etheric body.
Because the etheric body has its seat within the physical body, our
astral body, and our I perceive only what the physical body brings
them from the world and enables them to think of through the
instrument of the brain. The etheric body is too deeply embedded in
the physical body for it to be experienced in ordinary life as an
independent entity, as an independent instrument of cognition, or as
an instrument of feeling and willing.

The efforts in concentrated thinking, according to the instructions
given nowadays --- and given also by the Rosicrucians --- the
efforts in meditation, the cleansing of the moral feelings: all
these finally produce on the etheric body the effect described in my
book, [***Knowledge of the Higher
Worlds***](https://www.rsarchive.org/Books/GA010/). As we use our
eyes for seeing and our hands for grasping, so eventually we shall
use the etheric body with its organs, but for looking into the
spiritual, not the physical, world. The way in which we gather
together and concentrate our inner life works for the independence
of the etheric body.

It is necessary, however, that we should first permeate ourselves,
at least tentatively, with the idea of karma. And we do this when we
establish a certain moral equilibrium, a balance of the soul-forces
of feeling. A person who cannot to a certain extent grasp the
thought that 'in the long run I myself am to blame for my impulses',
will not be able to make good progress. A certain equanimity and
understanding with regard to karma, even if only a purely
hypothetical understanding, are necessary as a starting-point. A
person who never gets away from his ego, who is so dependent upon
his narrowly limited ways of feeling and perception that when things
go wrong he always blames others and never himself; a person who is
always filled with the idea that the world, or a part of his
environment, is against him; a man who never gets beyond the results
of applying ordinary thinking to whatever can be learnt from
exoteric Theosophy --- such a person will find progress particularly
difficult. Hence it is well that in order to develop equanimity and
calmness of soul we should make ourselves familiar with the idea
that when something does not succeed, particularly on the occult
path, we must blame not others but ourselves. This does most to help
our progress. What helps least is always wanting to lay the blame on
the world outside, or always wanting to change our training methods.

Our attitude in such matters is more important than perhaps appears.
It is better to test carefully, at all times, how little we have
learnt, and to seek the fault in ourselves when progress is not
made. It is a quite significant advance when we can make up our
minds always to seek the fault in ourselves. Then we shall see that
we are making progress not only in farther off things but also in
matters of external life. Those who have some experience in this
field will always be able to testify that by accepting the blame for
their own lack of success, they have found something that makes
precisely their external life easy and bearable. We shall get on
much more easily with our environment when we can truly grasp this
fact. We shall rise above much grumbling and hypochondria, above
complaining and lamenting, and pursue our way more calmly. For we
should reflect that in every true modern Initiation he who gives
advice is under the strictest obligation not to penetrate into the
innermost sanctuary of the soul. With regard to this most inward
part of the soul, therefore, we have from the start to undertake
something for ourselves, and we should not complain that we are
perhaps not getting the right advice. The advice may be right and
yet the results may not be satisfactory, if we fail to make the
resolve I have indicated.

This equanimity, this calmness, once we have made our choice --- and
the choice should come only from a serious resolve --- is a good
ground for meditation concerned with thoughts and feelings. In
everything founded on Rosicrucianism an important point is that in
meditation and concentration we are always directed not to dogma but
to the universally human. The deviation of which we spoke yesterday
takes its start from subject-matter that is first given to the
aspirant for holding in his mind. But what if this subject-matter
had first to be tested by occult cognition? What if it were not in
any way firmly established in advance? We must take our stand on
Rosicrucian principles, one of which is that we are not in a
position to decide about anything which is supported only by
external documents, for example, the accounts of what took place as
the Event of Golgotha. We must come to know these things first by
the occult path; we may not assume them beforehand. Hence we should
start from the universally human, from that which can be justified
by every soul.

A glance into the great world, marveling at the revelation of light
in the sun, feeling that what our eyes see of light is only the
external veil of the light, its external revelation, or, as is said
in Christian esotericism, the glory of light, and then yielding
oneself up to the thought that behind the external sensible light
something quite different is hidden --- all this is fundamentally
human. To think of, to gaze on, the light spread out through
infinite space, and then clearly to feel that in this infinitely
extended element of the light something spiritual must live,
something which weaves this web of light in space; to concentrate
upon these thoughts, to live in them --- here we have something
universally human, presented not through dogma but through universal
feeling. Or again, to perceive the warmth of nature, to feel how
through the universe, along with the warmth, something moves in
which there is spirit. Then, out of certain relationships in our own
organism with the feeling of love, to concentrate on the thought of
how warmth can exist spiritually, how it lives pulsing through the
world. Then, to sink oneself into what we can learn from intuitions
given to us by modern occult teaching. Then to take counsel with
those who know something in this realm as to concentrating in the
right way upon world thoughts, cosmic thoughts. And further, the
ennobling, the cleansing, of moral perceptions, whereby we come to
understand that what we feel to be moral is reality. So we rise
above the prejudice that these moral feelings are something
transitory; we realise that they live on, are stamped into us as
moral realities. We learn to feel the responsibility of being placed
in the world as conscious beings, together with our moral feelings.
All esoteric life is fundamentally directed towards universally
human experiences of this kind.

I will now describe how far we can go through exercises which take
their start in this way from human nature, if only we devote
ourselves to a clear-sighted examination of our own human nature.
From this beginning we come to a loosening of the connection between
the physical body and the etheric body, and to a new kind of
knowledge. We give birth as it were, to a second man within
ourselves, so that we are no longer so firmly connected with the
physical body as before. And in the finest moments of life we feel
the etheric and astral bodies as though enclosed in an external
sheath, and thereby know ourselves to be free from the instrument of
the physical body. That is what we attain. We shall then be led to
see our physical body in its true being, and to recognise how it
affects us when we are within it. We become aware of the whole
working of the physical body upon us only when we have in a certain
sense come out of it, like the snake which after casting its skin
can look upon the skin from outside, though feeling it as a part of
itself. Through the first stages of Initiation we learn in like
manner to feel ourselves free from the physical body, and learn to
recognise it. At this moment quite special feelings will steal over
us, which may be described as follows. (There are so many different
experiences along the path of Initiation that it has not yet been
possible to describe them all. In [***Knowledge of the Higher
Worlds***](https://www.rsarchive.org/Books/GA010/) you will find
much on the subject, but there is a great deal more.)

The first experience, open to nearly everyone who turns from
ordinary life to pursue the path of knowledge, leads us to say, in
accordance with our feeling: 'This physical body as it is, as it
appears to me, has not been formed by myself. Most certainly I have
not made this physical body, through which I have been brought to be
what I am in the world. Without this body, the "I" which I now
regard as my great ideal, would not have arisen within me. I have
become what I am only through having kept my physical body riveted
upon me.'

At first all this gives rise to something like resentment,
bitterness, against the Cosmic Powers. It is easy to say, 'I will
not cherish this resentment.' But when there arises before us in
melancholy majesty a picture of what we have become through being
bound up with the physical body, the effect is overwhelming. We feel
something like bitter hatred for the Cosmic Powers on this account.
But now our occult training must be so far advanced that we overcome
this hatred and on a higher level can say with our whole being, with
our individuality which has already come down into repeated
incarnations, that we ourselves are responsible for what our
physical body has become. When we have mastered the bitterness, we
experience the perception, already often described: 'Now I know I am
that very thing which appears there as the changed form of my
physical being. That I am myself. But because my physical being was
crushing me to death, I knew nothing of it.'

We stand here before the significant meeting with the Guardian of
the Threshold. But if we come so far, if through the strenuousness
of our exercises we experience what has just been said, then from
out of what is common to human nature we recognise that we are as we
are in our present form as the result of preceding incarnations. But
we also recognise that we can experience the deepest pain and must
work our way out beyond this pain to the overcoming of our present
existence. And for every man who is sufficiently far advanced and
has experienced these feelings in all their intensity, who has
looked upon the Guardian of the Threshold, there arises of necessity
an Imaginative picture, a picture not painted by constraint, as in
Jesuitism, from passages in the Bible but a picture that each man
experiences through having felt, in a general human sense, what he
is.

Through these experiences he will quite naturally come to know the
picture of the Divine Ideal-Man, who like us lived in a physical
body, and who like us in this physical body felt all that a physical
body can bring about. The Temptation, and the picture of it as
presented to us in the synoptic Gospels, the leading of Christ Jesus
to the mountain, the promise of all external realities, the desire
to cling to these outer realities, the temptation to remain attached
to matter: in short, the temptation to remain with the Guardian of
the Threshold and not to pass beyond him appears to us in the great
imaginative picture of Christ Jesus standing on the mountain, with
the Tempter beside Him --- a picture that would have arisen before
us even if we had never heard of the Gospels. And then we know that
he who wrote the story of the Temptation depicted his own experience
of seeing, in the spirit, Christ Jesus and the Tempter. Then we know
it is true in the Spirit that the writer of the Gospel has described
something that we ourselves can experience even if we knew nothing
of the Gospels. Thus we shall be led to a picture which is similar
to the picture in the Gospels. We gain for ourselves what stands in
the Gospels. Nothing is forced upon us; everything is drawn forth
from the depths of our own nature. We proceed from the universally
human and bring forth the Gospels afresh through our occult life. We
feel ourselves at one with the writers of the Gospels.

Then there arises within us another feeling, a next step along the
occult path. We feel how the Tempter has grown into a powerful Being
who is behind all the phenomena of the world. Yes, we learn indeed
to know the Tempter, but by degrees we learn in a certain way to
value him. We learn to say: 'The world spread out before us, whether
it be Maya or something else, has its right to exist; it has
revealed something to me.' Then comes a second feeling, a quite
definite one for every person who fulfils the conditions of a
Rosicrucian initiation. The feeling arises: 'We belong to the Spirit
Who lives in all things, and with Whom we have to reckon. We cannot
in the least comprehend the Spirit if we do not surrender ourselves
to it.' Then fear comes over us. We experience fear such as every
real knower must undergo; a feeling for the greatness of the Cosmic
Spirit who pervades the world. We are in the presence of this
greatness and we feel our own powerlessness. We feel also what we
might have become in the course of the earth\'s history, or in that
of the Cosmos. We feel our own impotent existence so far removed
from Divine existence. We feel fear in face of the ideal we must
come to resemble, and of the magnitude of the effort which should
lead us to that ideal. As through esotericism we must feel the whole
magnitude of the effort, so must we feel this fear as a struggle we
take upon ourselves, a wrestling with the Spirit of the Cosmos. When
we feel our own littleness, and the necessary struggle laid upon us
to attain our ideal, to become one with that which works and weaves
in the world --- when we experience this with fear, then only may we
lay fear aside and betake ourselves to the path, to the paths which
lead us to our ideal. And if we feel this completely and rightly,
there comes before us yet another significant Imagination. If we had
never read a Gospel, if mankind had never had such an external book,
a spiritual picture would rise before our clairvoyant sight.

We are led out into the solitude which stands clearly before the
inner eye, and we are brought before the picture of the Ideal Man
who in a human body experienced all the immeasurable fears and
anguish that we ourselves can taste in this moment. The picture of
Christ in Gethsemane stands before us, as He experienced fear to an
overwhelmingly intensified degree, the fear that we ourselves must
feel on the path of Initiation, the fear that wrung from His brow
the Bloody Sweat. That is the picture we encounter at a certain
point on our occult path, independently of all external documents.
So we have, standing before us like two great pillars on the occult
path, the story of the Temptation experienced spiritually, and the
scene on the Mount of Olives experienced spiritually. And then we
understand the words: Watch and pray, and live in prayer, so that
you will never be tempted to remain standing at any one point, but
will continually stride forward.

This means that first of all we experience the Gospel; we experience
everything so that we could write it down just as the writers of the
Gospels have described it. For we do not need to take these two
pictures from the Gospel; we can take them out of our own inner
consciousness; we can bring them forth out of the Holy of Holies of
the soul. No teacher is needed to come and say: 'You must place
before yourself in imagination the Temptation, and the scene on the
Mount of Olives.' We need only bring before ourselves that which can
be developed in our consciousness through meditation, purification
of our common human feelings, and so on. Then, without constraint
from anyone, we call forth the Imaginations which are contained in
the Gospels.

In the Jesuit spiritual movement the pupil had the Gospels given to
him first, and afterwards he experienced what the Gospels describe.
The way we have indicated today shows that when a man has taken the
path of the spiritual life, he experiences occultly that which is
connected with his own life, and thereby can experience through
himself the pictures, the Imaginations, of the Gospels.
