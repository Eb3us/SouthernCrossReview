<p class="intropoem">Ladies and Gentlemen,</p>
<p>In Economic Science, as I explained yesterday, it is essential to
take hold of something that is for ever fluctuating — namely: the
circulation of values and the mutual interplay of fluctuating values in
the forming of Price. Bearing this in mind, you say to yourselves: Our
first need is to discover what is really the proper <em>form</em> of the
science of Economics. For a thing that fluctuates cannot be taken hold
of directly. There is no real sense in trying to take hold by direct
observation of something that is forever fluctuating. The only sensible
procedure is to consider it in connection with what really lies beneath
it.</p>
<p>Let us take an example. For certain purposes in life we use a
thermometer. We use it to read the degrees of temperature, which we have
grown accustomed in a certain sense to compare with one another. For
instance, we estimate 20° of warmth in relation to 5° and so on. We may
also construct temperature curves. We plot the temperatures for instance
during the winter, followed by the rising temperatures in summer. Our
curve will then represent the fluctuating level of the thermometer. But
we do not come to the underlying reality till we consider the various
conditions which determine the lower temperature in the winter, the
higher temperature in the summer months, the temperature in one
district, the different temperature in another, and so forth. We only
have something real in hand, so to speak, when we refer the varying
levels of the mercury to that which underlies them. To record the
readings of the thermometer is in itself a mere statistical procedure.
And in Economics it is not much more than this when we merely study
prices and values and so forth. It only begins to have a real meaning
when we regard prices and values much as we regard the positions of the
mercury — as indications, pointing to something else. Only then do we
arrive at the realities of economic life. This consideration will lead
us to the true and proper <em>form</em> of Economic Science.</p>
<p>By ancient usage, as you are probably aware, the sciences are
classified as theoretical and practical. Ethics, for instance, is called
a practical science, Natural Science a theoretical one. Natural Science
deals with that which <em>is;</em> Ethics with that which <em>ought</em>
to be. This distinction has been made since ancient time: the Sciences
of that which <em>is,</em> the Sciences of that which <em>should
be.</em> We mention this here only to help define the concept of
Economic Science. For we may well ask ourselves this question: Is
Economics a science of what <em>is,</em> as Lujo Brentano, for instance,
would assert? Or is it a practical science — a science of what
<em>ought</em> to be? That is the question.</p>
<p>Now, if we wish to arrive at any knowledge in Economics it is
undoubtedly necessary to make observations. We have to make
observations, just as we must observe the readings of the barometer and
thermometer to ascertain the state of air and warmth. So far, Economics
is a theoretical science. But at this point, nothing has yet been
<em>done.</em> We only achieve something when we are really able to
<em>act </em>under the influence of this theoretical knowledge.</p>
<p>Take a special case. Let us assume that by certain observations
(which, like all observations, until they lead to action, will be of a
theoretical nature) we ascertain that in a given place, in a given
sphere, the price of a certain commodity falls considerably, so much so
as to give rise to acute distress. In the first place, then, we observe
— “theoretically,” as I have said — this actual fall in price. Here, so
to speak, we are still only at the stage of reading the thermometer. But
now the question will arise: What are we to <em>do</em> if the price of
a commodity or product falls to an undesirable extent? We shall have to
go into these matters more closely later on: for the moment I will but
indicate what should be done and by whom, if the price of some commodity
shows a considerable decrease. There may be many such measures, but one
of them will be to do something to accelerate the circulation, the
commerce or trade in the commodity in question. This will be one
possible measure, though naturally it will not be enough by itself. For
the moment, however, we shall not discuss whether it is a sufficient, or
even the right measure to take. The point is: If prices fall in such a
way, we must do <em>something</em> of a kind that can increase the
turnover [Umsatz].</p>
<p>It is in fact similar to what happens when we observe the
thermometer. If we feel cold in a room, we do not go to the thermometer
and try by some mysterious device to lengthen out the column of mercury.
We leave the thermometer alone and stoke the fire. We get at the thing
from quite a different angle; and so it must be in Economics too. When
it comes to action, we must start from quite a different angle. Then
only does it become practical. We must answer, therefore: The science of
Economics is both theoretical and practical. The point will be how to
bring the practical and the theoretical together.</p>
<p>Here we have one aspect of the <em>form</em> of Economic Science. The
other aspect is one to which I drew attention many years ago, though it
was not understood. It was in an essay I wrote at the beginning of the
century, which at that time was entitled: “Theosophy and the Social
Question.” It would only have had real significance if it had been taken
up by men of affairs and if they had acted accordingly. But it was left
altogether unnoticed; consequently I did not complete it or publish any
more of it. We can only hope that these things will be more and more
understood, and I trust these lectures will contribute to a deeper
understanding. To understand the present point, we must now insert a
brief historical reflection.</p>
<p>Go back a little way in the history of mankind. As I pointed out in
the first lecture, in former epochs — nay, even as late as the
15<sup>th</sup> or 16<sup>th</sup> century — economic questions such as
we have today did not exist at all. In oriental antiquity economic life
took its course instinctively, to a very large extent. Certain social
conditions obtained among men — caste-forming and class-forming
conditions — and the relations between man and man which arose out of
these conditions had the power to shape instincts for the way in which
the individual must play his particular part in economic life. These
things were very largely founded on the impulses of religious life,
which in those ancient times were still of such a kind as to aim
simultaneously at the ordering of economic affairs. Study oriental
history: you will see there is nowhere a hard and fast dividing line
between what is ordained for the religious life and what is ordained for
the economic one. The religious commandments very largely extended into
the economic life. In those early times, the question of labour, or of
the social circulation of labour-values did not arise. Labour was
performed in a certain sense instinctively. Whether one person was to do
more or less never became a pressing question, not at any rate a
pressing public question in pre-Roman times. Such exceptions as there
may be are of no importance, compared to the general course of human
evolution. Even in Plato we find a conception of social life wherein the
performance of labour is accepted as a complete matter of course. Only
those aspects are considered which Plato beholds as wisdom-filled
ethical and social impulses, excluding the performance of labour, which
is taken for granted.</p>
<p>But in the course of time this became more and more different. As the
religious and ethical impulses became less effective in creating
economic instincts, as they became more restricted to the moral life,
mere precepts as to how people should feel for one another or relate
themselves to extra-human powers, there arose more and more the feeling
in mankind which, pictorially stated, might be thus expressed: “<em>Ex
cathedra,</em> or from the pulpit, nothing whatever can be said about
the way a man should work!” Only now did Labour — the incorporation of
Labour in the social life — become a question.</p>
<p>Now this incorporation of Labour in social life is historically
impossible without the rise of all that is comprised in the term “law”
or “rights.” We see emerge at the same historical moment the assignment
of value to Labour in relation to the individual human being and what we
now call law. Go back into very ancient times of human history and you
cannot properly speak of law or rights as we conceive them today. You
can only do so from the moment when the Law becomes distinct from the
“Commandment.” In very ancient times there is only one kind of command
or commandment, which includes at the same time all that concerns
Rights. Subsequently, the “Commandment” is restricted more to the life
of the soul, while Law makes itself felt with respect to outer life.
This again takes place within a certain historic epoch, during which
time definite social relationships evolved. It would take us too far
afield to describe all this in detail, but it is an interesting study —
especially for the first centuries of the Middle Ages — to see how the
relationships of Law and Rights on the one hand, and on the other those
of Labour, became distinct from the religious organizations in which
they had hitherto been more or less closely merged. I mean, of course,
religious organizations in the wider sense of the term.</p>
<p>Now this change involves an important consequence. You see, so long
as religious impulses dominate the entire social life of mankind, human
Egoism does no harm. This is a most important point, notably for an
understanding of the social and economic life. Man may be never so
selfish; if there is a religious organization (and these, be it noted,
were very strict in certain districts in oriental antiquity) such that
in spite of his egoism the individual is fruitfully placed in the social
whole, it will do no harm. But Egoism begins to play a part in the life
of nations the moment human Rights and Labour emancipate themselves from
other social impulses or social currents. Hence, during the historical
period when Labour and legally determined Rights are becoming
emancipated, the spirit of humanity strives, as it were unconsciously,
to come to grips with Egoism, which now begins to make itself felt and
must in some way be allowed for in social life. And in the last resort,
this striving culminates in nothing else than modern Democracy — the
sense for the equality of man — the feeling that each must have his
influence in determining legal Rights and in determining the Labour
which he contributes.</p>
<p>Moreover, simultaneously with this culmination of the emancipated
life of Rights and human labour, another element arises which — though
it undoubtedly existed in former epochs of human evolution — had quite a
different significance in those times owing to the operation of
religious impulses. In European civilization, during the Middle Ages, it
existed only to a very limited degree, but it reached its zenith at the
very time when Rights and Labour were emancipated most of all. I refer
to the Division of Labour.</p>
<p>You see, in former epochs the division of labour had no peculiar
significance. It too was included in the religious impulses. Everyone,
so to speak, had his proper place assigned to him. But it was very
different when the democratic tendency united with the tendency to
division of labour — a process which only began in the last few
centuries and reached its climax in the nineteenth century. Then the
division of labour gained very great significance.</p>
<p>For the division of labour entails a certain economic consequence. We
shall yet, of course, have to consider its causes and the course of its
development. To begin with, however, if we think it abstractly to its
conclusion, we must say that in the last resort it leads to this: No one
uses for himself what he produces. Economically speaking, what will this
signify? Let us consider an example.</p>
<p>Suppose there is a tailor making clothes. Given the division of
labour, he must, of course, be making them for other people. But he may
say to himself: I will make clothes for others and I will also make my
own clothes for myself. He will then devote a certain portion of his
labour to making his own clothes, and the remainder — by far the greater
portion — to making clothes for other people. Well, superficially
considered, one may say: It is the most natural thing in the world, even
under the system of division of labour, for a tailor to make his own
clothes and then go on working as a tailor for his fellows. But,
<em>economically,</em> how does the matter stand? Through the very fact
that there is division of labour, and every man does not make all his
own things for himself — through the very fact that there is division of
labour and one man always works for another, the various products will
have certain values and consequently prices. Now the division of labour
extends, of course, into the actual circulation of the products.
Assuming, therefore, that by virtue of the division of labour, extending
as it does into the circulation of the products, the tailor's products
have a certain value; will those he makes for himself have the same
economic value? Or will they possibly be cheaper or more expensive? That
is the most important question. If he makes his own clothes for himself
one thing will certainly be eliminated. They will not enter into the
general circulation of products. Thus what he makes for himself will not
share in the cheapening, due to the division of labour. It will,
therefore, be dearer. Though he pays nothing for it, it will be more
expensive. For on those products of his labour which he uses for
himself, it is impossible for him to expend as little labour — compared
to their value — as he expends on those that pass into general
circulation.</p>
<p>Well, I admit, this may require a little closer consideration,
nevertheless it is so. What one produces for oneself does not enter into
the general circulation which is founded on the division of labour.
Consequently it is more expensive. Thinking the division of labour to
its logical conclusion, we must say: A tailor, who is obliged to work
for other people only, will tend to obtain for his products the prices
which ought to be obtained. For himself, he will have to buy his clothes
from another tailor, or rather, he will get them through the ordinary
channels: he will buy them at the places where clothes are sold.</p>
<p>These things considered, you will realise that the division of labour
tends towards this conclusion: No one any longer works for himself at
all. All that he produces by his labour is passed on to other men, and
what he himself requires must come to him in turn from the community. Of
course, you may object: If the tailor buys his suit from another tailor,
it will cost him just as much as if he made it for himself: the other
tailor will not produce it any more cheaply nor more expensively. But if
this objection were true, we should not have division of labour — or at
least the division of labour would not be complete. For it would mean
that the maximum concentration of work, due to the division of labour,
could not be applied to this particular product of tailoring. In effect,
once we have the division of labour, it must inevitably extend into the
process of circulation. It is in fact impossible for the tailor to buy
from another tailor; in reality he must buy from a tradesman and this
will result in quite a different value. If he makes his own coat for
himself, he will “buy” it from himself. If he actually buys it, he buys
it from a tradesman. That is the difference. If division of labour in
conjunction with the process of circulation has a cheapening effect, his
coat will, for that reason, cost him less at the tradesman's. He cannot
make it as cheaply for himself.</p>
<p>To begin with, let us regard this as a line of thought that will lead
us to the true form of Economic Science. The facts themselves will, of
course, all of them, have to be considered again later.</p>
<p>Meanwhile it is absolutely true — and indeed self-evident — that the
more the division of labour advances, the more it will come about that
one man always works for the rest — for the community in general — and
never for himself. In other words, with the rise of the modern division
of labour, the economic life as such depends on Egoism being extirpated,
root and branch. I beg you to take this remark not in an ethical but in
a purely economic sense. Economically speaking, egoism is impossible. I
can no longer do anything for myself; the more the division of labour
advances, the more must I do everything for others.</p>
<p>The summons to altruism has, in fact, come far more quickly through
purely outward circumstances in the economic sphere than it has been
answered on the ethical and religious side. This is illustrated by an
easily accessible historical fact.</p>
<p>The word “Egoism,” you will find, is a pretty old one, though not
perhaps in the severe meaning we attach to it today. But its opposite —
the word “Altruism,” “to think for another” — is scarcely a hundred
years old. As a word, it was coined very late. We need not dwell
overmuch on this external feature, though a closer historical study
would confirm the indication. But we may truly say: Human thought on
Ethics was far from having arrived at a full appreciation of altruism at
a time when the division of labour had already brought about its
appreciation in economic life. Taking it, therefore, in its purely
economic aspect, we see at once the further consequences of this demand
for altruism. We must find our way into the true process of modern
economic life, wherein no man has to provide for himself, but only for
his fellow-men. We must realise how by this means each individual will,
in fact, be provided for in the best possible way.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, this might easily be taken for a piece of
idealism, but I beg you to observe once more: In this lecture I am
speaking neither idealistically nor ethically, but from an
<em>economic</em> point of view. What I have just said is intended in a
purely economic sense. It is neither a God, nor a moral law, nor an
instinct that calls for altruism in modern economic life — altruism in
work, altruism in the production of goods. It is the modern division of
labour — a purely economic category — that requires it.</p>
<p>This is approximately what I desired to set forth in the essay I
published long ago. In recent times our economic life has begun to
require more of us than we are ethically, religiously, capable of
achieving. This is the underlying fact of many a conflict. Study the
sociology of the present day and you will find: The social conflicts are
largely due to the fact that, as economic systems expanded into a
World-Economy, it became more and more needful to be altruistic, to
organize the various social institutions altruistically; while, in their
way of thinking, men had not yet been able to get beyond Egoism and
therefore kept on interfering with the course of things in a clumsy,
selfish way.</p>
<p>But we shall only arrive at the full significance of this if we
observe not merely the plain and obvious fact, but the same fact in its
more masked and hidden forms. Owing to this discrepancy in the mentality
of present-day mankind — owing to the discrepancy between the demands of
the economic life and the inadequate ethical and religious response —
the following state of affairs is largely predominant in practice. To a
large extent, in present-day economic life, men are providing for
<em>themselves.</em> That is to say, our economic life is actually in
contradiction to what — by virtue of the division of labour — is its own
fundamental demand. The few who provide for themselves on the model of
our tailor do not so much matter. A tailor who manufactures his own
clothes is obviously one who <em>mixes up</em> with the division of
labour something that does not properly belong to it. But this is open
and unmasked. The same thing is present in a hidden form in modern
economic life where — though he by no means makes his products for
himself — a man has little or nothing to do with the value or price of
the products of his labour. Quite apart from the whole economic process
in which these products are contained, he simply has to contribute, as a
value to the economic life, the labour of his hands. It amounts to this:
To this day, every wage-earner in the ordinary sense is a man who
provides for himself. He gives only so much as he wants to earn. In
fact, he simply cannot be giving as much to the social organism as he
might give, for he will only give so much as he wants to earn. In
effect, to provide for oneself is to work for one's earnings, to work
“for a living.” To work for others is to work out of a sense of
<em>social</em> needs.</p>
<p>To the extent that the demand which the division of labour involves
has been fulfilled in our time, altruism is actually present — namely:
work for others. But to the extent that the demand is unfulfilled, the
old egoism persists. It has its roots in this — that men are still
obliged to provide for themselves. That is economic Egoism. In the case
of the ordinary wage-earner we generally fail to notice the fact. For we
do not ask ourselves: What is it that values are really being exchanged
for in this case? The thing which the ordinary wage-earner manufactures
has after all nothing to do with the payment for his work — absolutely
nothing to do with it. The payment — the value that is assigned to his
work — proceeds from altogether different factors. He, therefore, works
for his earnings, works “for a living.” He works to provide for himself.
It is hidden, it is masked, but it is so.</p>
<p>Thus one of the first and most essential economic questions comes
before us. How are we to eliminate from the economic process this
principle of work for a living? Those who to this day are still mere
wage-earners — earners of a living for themselves — how are they to be
placed in the whole economic process, no longer as such earners but as
men who work because of social needs? Must this really be done?
Assuredly it must. For if this is not done, we shall never obtain true
prices but always false ones. We must seek to obtain prices and values
that depend not on the human beings but on the economic process itself —
prices that arise in the process of fluctuation of values. The cardinal
question is the question of Price.</p>
<p>We must observe prices as we observe the degrees of the thermometer,
and then look for the underlying conditions.</p>
<p>Now to observe a thermometer we need some kind of zero point, from
which we go upward and downward. And for prices a kind of zero-level
does in fact arise in a perfectly natural way.</p>
<p>It arises in this way. Here we have Nature on the one side.</p>
<p><img src="steiner-economy-diagram.jpg" class="alarge" /></p>
<p>(Diagram 2) It is transformed by human Labour. Thus we get the
transformed products of Nature, and this is one point at which values
are created. On the other side we have Labour itself. It, in its turn,
is modified by the Spirit, and there arises the other kind of value.
Value 1, Value 2. And, as I said on a previous occasion, price
originates by the interaction of Value 1 and Value 2.</p>
<p>Now these Values on either hand — Value 1 and Value 2 — are in fact
related to one another as pole to pole. And we may put it as follows: If
a man is working in <em>this</em> sphere, for example (Diagram 2
right-hand side), or mainly so — in an absolute sense it is of course
impossible, but I mean mainly in this sphere — if in the main his work
is of the type that is organized by the spirit, then it will be to his
interest that the products of Nature should decrease in value. If on the
other hand a man is working directly upon Nature, it will be to his
interest that the other kind of products should decrease in value. Now
when this “interest” becomes an effective process (and so, in fact, it
is, for if it were not so, the farmers would have very different prices,
and <em>vice versa;</em> the actual prices on both sides are, of course,
very “occult”) we <em>may</em> be able to observe a kind of <em>Mean
Price</em> midway between the two poles where we have two persons (there
must always be two, for any economic dealings) with little interest
either in Nature or Spirituality or Capital. When is it so in practice?
We have the case in practice if we observe a pure trader, a pure
middleman, buying from and selling to a pure middleman. Here, prices
will tend towards a mean. If under normal conditions (we shall yet have
to explain this word “normal”) a middleman trading in boots and shoes
buys from a middleman trading in clothes and <em>vice versa,</em> the
prices that emerge will tend to assume the mean position. To find, the
mean price-level, we must not go to the interests of those producers who
are on the side of Nature, nor of those who are on the Spiritual side.
We must go to where middleman trades with middleman, buying and selling.
Here it is that the mean price will tend to arise. Whether there be one
middleman more or less is immaterial.</p>
<p>This does not contradict what we have said before. After all, look at
the typical modern capitalist. Are they not all of them traders? The
industrialist is after all a trader. Incidentally he is a producer of
his particular goods; but economically he is a trader. Commerce has
developed very largely on the side of production. In all essentials, the
industrial capitalist is a trader. This is important. In actual fact,
modern conditions amount to this: All that arises here in the middle
(Diagram 2) rays out to the one side and to the other. On the one side
you will soon recognise it if you study the typical business
undertaking; and we shall see how it appears on the other side in the
course of the next few days.</p>
