Pagels, professor of religion at Princeton University, became famous ï¿½ well, at
least well known ï¿½ with the publication of her book, <i><span style="font-style:
italic">The Gnostic Gospels, </span></i>in 1979. She has written several other
books as well on the history of Christianity, establishing her as the foremost
popular scholar in the field. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:

<p class="MsoNormal"><i><font size="3" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-style:italic">Beyond Belief</span></font></i><span lang="EN-US">, published in 2003 by Random House, is a sort of sequel to The
Secret Gospels, in that it incorporates the new scholarship that has come to
light since that book was published. Since Ms. Pagels' infant son was diagnosed
with fatal pulmonary hypertension, her pursuit of knowledge about who Jesus
really was has become a question of personal urgency for her. This need is
reflected in the text and transforms the book into much more than a scholarly
treatise for the curious. She wants to know what Christ meant to his followers
before doctrine and dogmas, in other words, before Christianity was invented by
the Church. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:
12.0pt"><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:
12.0pt">The discovery of the Gospel of Thomas, along with other early Christian
texts, offers revealing clues. Pagels compares Thomasï¿½s gospel (which claims to
give Jesusï¿½ secret teaching, and indicates an affinity with the Kabbalah) with
the canonic texts to show how the early Church chose to include some gospels
and exclude others from the collection we know as the New Testament ï¿½ and why.
During the time of persecution of Christians, the church fathers constructed
the canon, creed and hierarchy, suppressing many of its spiritual resources in
the process, in order to avoid conflict with Roman law and religion.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:
12.0pt"><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:
12.0pt">A prime example is the label of heresy attached to the Gospel of
Thomas, and its subsequent suppression. If a copy hadnï¿½t been found by accident
(or destiny?) in the caves of Nag Hammadi, along with many other documents
during the middle of the twentieth century, weï¿½d have never even known of its
existence. Such secret writings had been denounced by Irenaeus, bishop of Lyon
(c.180) as ï¿½an abyss of madness, and blasphemy against Christ.ï¿½ Pagels had
therefore expected to find madness and blasphemy in these texts, but when she
first studied them in Harvard graduate school she found the contrary in sayings
such as this from Thomas. ï¿½Jesus said: <i><span style="font-style:italic">If
you bring forth what is within you, what you will bring forth will save you. If
you do not bring forth what is within you, what you do not bring forth will
destroy you</span></i>. Pagels found that ï¿½..the strength of this saying is
that it does not tell us what to believe but challenges us to discover what
lies hidden within ourselves; and, with a shock of recognition, I realized that
this perspective seemed to me to be self-evidently true.ï¿½</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:
12.0pt"><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:
12.0pt">However, certain church leaders from the second through the fourth
centuries rejected many of these sources of revelation and constructed instead
the New Testament gospel canon of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, which has
defined Christianity to this day. The Gospel of John is of special importance
in church dogma, and its basic tenets seem to be in direct opposition to
Thomas. John says that he writes ï¿½so that you may <i><span style="font-style:
italic">believe</span></i>, <i><span style="font-style:italic">and believing</span></i>
may have life in [Jesusï¿½] name.ï¿½ Thomasï¿½s gospel, however, encourages us not so
much to <i><span style="font-style:italic">believe in Jesus, </span></i>as John
demands, as to <i><span style="font-style:italic">seek to know God </span></i>through
oneï¿½s own, divinely given capacity, since all are created in the image of God.
ï¿½For Christians of later generations, the Gospel of John helped provide a
foundation for a unified church, which Thomas, with its emphasis on each
personï¿½s search for God, did not.ï¿½</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:
12.0pt"><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:
12.0pt">According to Pagels, John is the only evangelist who actually states
that Jesus is God incarnated. But not only Pagels says so. In one of his
commentaries on John, Origen ï¿½ a church father, (c.240)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">ï¿½ </span></sub>- writes that while the other gospels
describe Jesus as human, ï¿½none of them clearly spoke of his divinity, as John
does.ï¿½ One may object that the other three, synoptic (ï¿½seeing togetherï¿½)
gospels call Jesus ï¿½son of Godï¿½, and this is virtually the same thing. But such
titles (son of God, messiah) in Jesusï¿½ time designated human, not divine roles.
When translated into English fifteen centuries later, these were capitalized ï¿½
a linguistic convention that does not occur in the original Greek. When all
four gospels, together with Paulï¿½s letters, were united in the New Testament
(c. 160 to 360) most Christians had come to read all
four through Johnï¿½s lens, that Jesus is ï¿½Lord and Godï¿½.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:
12.0pt"><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:
12.0pt">Pagels feels that if the Gospel of Thomas were included in the New
Testament instead of that of John, or even if it were included along with John,
the development of Christianity would have been quite different. Whereas Mark,
Matthew and Luke identify Jesus as Godï¿½s human agent, John and Thomas
characterize him as Godï¿½s own light in human form. Both claim to reveal, at
least to a certain extent, Jesusï¿½ ï¿½secret teachingsï¿½, and assume that their
readers are already familiar with the synoptic gospels. </span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:

<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:
12.0pt">Despite their similarities, John and Thomas point the secret teachings
in sharply different directions. John claims that we can experience God only
through the divine light embodied in Jesus, while Thomas says that the divine
light embodied in Jesus is already shared by humanity since we are all made ï¿½in
the image of Godï¿½. Thomas thus expresses what would become a central theme of
Jewish, and later Christian, mysticism a thousand years later: that the ï¿½image
of Godï¿½ is hidden within everyone, and it is a question of recognizing this and
finding it through oneï¿½s own efforts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:
12.0pt">(On the question of Jesusï¿½ divinity, Rudolf Steiner ï¿½ not consulted by
Pagels ï¿½<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">ï¿½ </span>offered an interesting
solution: that Jesus was indeed a human being, but that ï¿½a godï¿½, Christ,
incarnated in him at the moment of baptism in the Jordan.)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">ï¿½ </span></span></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:
12.0pt">At one point in her description of the dispute among the early
Christians about who Jesus really was, Pagels quotes Mark: <i><span style="font-style:italic">ï¿½he asked his disciples, ï¿½Who do people say that I
am?ï¿½ And they told him, ï¿½John the Baptist; and others say Elijah; and others,
one of the prophets.ï¿½ And he asked them, ï¿½But who do you say that I am?ï¿½ Peter
answered him, ï¿½You are the messiah.ï¿½ </span></i>In view of this passage, it has
always seemed contradictory to me the contention that Christianity ï¿½ and
Judaism ï¿½ do not embrace the idea of reincarnation, even reject it, when these
first Jewish Christians seem to act as though it were common knowledge. </span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:
12.0pt"><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:
12.0pt">The synoptic gospels claim that Jesusï¿½ teaching predicted the coming of
the kingdom of God some time in the future, an interpretation still adhered to
by many Christians. However, both John and Thomas say something different, the
latter very specifically: Jesus said, <i><span style="font-style:italic">If
those who lead you say to you, ï¿½Look, the kingdom is in the skyï¿½, then the
birds of the sky will get there before youï¿½.If they say to you, ï¿½It is in the
sea,ï¿½ then the fish will get there before you. </span></i>And: <i><span style="font-style:italic">His disciples said to him, ï¿½When will the
resurrection of the dead come, and when will the new world come?ï¿½ He said to
them, ï¿½What you look forward to has already come, but you do not recognize it.ï¿½
<o:p></o:p></span></i></span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><font size="3" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-style:italic"><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></font></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:
12.0pt">Though the Gospel of Luke includes an alternative version of the same
idea (ï¿½ï¿½the kingdom of God is within youï¿½), Luke later retreats from this
position and concludes with the apocalyptic warning that the Son of Man is not
a divine presence in us all but a terrifying judge.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:

<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:
12.0pt">A century ago Leo Tolstoy, in his monumental <i><span style="font-style:
italic">The Kingdom of God is Within you</span></i>, urged Christians to give
up coercion and violence in order to realize Godï¿½s kingdom here and now. Thomas
Merton, the twentieth century writer and Trappist monk, agreed with Tolstoy but
interpreted his kingdom mystically rather then practically. We are confronted
here with the Catholic churchï¿½s insistence that humanity is sinful, base and
unworthy <i><span style="font-style:italic">by nature</span></i> and that
salvation from the pangs of hell is only possible through faith in Jesus and,
by obvious extension, his church, and his representative on earth, the pope.
But the Gospel of Thomas leaves spiritual destiny up to each individual. There
Jesus treats us as equals, or at least as struggling siblings:</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:

<blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:
12.0pt">ï¿½According to Thomas, Jesus rebukes those who seek access to God
elsewhere, evenï¿½perhaps especiallyï¿½those who seek it by trying to ï¿½follow
Jesusï¿½ himself. When certain disciples plead with Jesus to ï¿½show us the place
where you are, since it is necessary for us to seek it,ï¿½ he does not bother to
answer so misguided a question and redirects the disciples away from themselves
toward the light hidden within each person: ï¿½There is light within a person of
light, and it lights up the whole universe; If it does not shine, there is
darkness.ï¿½ In other words, one either discovers the light within that
illuminates ï¿½the whole universeï¿½ or lives in darkness, within and
without.ï¿½<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">ï¿½ï¿½ </span></span></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:
12.0pt">Finally, after so many centuries, the heretics are having their say.
Another most interesting document found at Nag Hammadi is the Gospel of Philip,
who explains baptism. Sometimes the person who receives baptism ï¿½receives the
holy spiritï¿½this is what happens when one experiences a mystery.ï¿½ Divine grace,
this implies, isnï¿½t sufficient; the initiateï¿½s capacity for spiritual
understanding is also a factor. ï¿½Faith is our earth, in which we take root;
hope is the water through which we are nourished; love is the air through which
we grow; <i><span style="font-style:italic">gnosis</span></i> is the light
through which we become fully grown.</span></font></p>
