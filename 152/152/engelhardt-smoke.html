<p class="intro">As it turns out, it’s never too late. I mention that only because
last week, at nearly 79, I managed to visit Mars for the first time. You
know, the red planet, or rather — so it seemed to me — <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/07/nyregion/nyc-wildfire-smoke-scenes.html">the
orange plane</a><a
href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/photography/interactive/2023/canada-wildfires-smoke-nyc-photos/">t</a>.
And take my word for it, it was eerie as hell. There was no sun, just a
strange orange haze of a kind I had never seen before as I walked the
streets of that world (well-masked) on my way to a doctor’s
appointment.</p>
<p>Oh, wait, maybe I’m a little mixed up. Maybe I wasn’t on Mars. The
strangeness of it all (and perhaps my age) might have left me just a bit
confused. My best hunch now, as I try to put recent events in
perspective, is that I wasn’t in life as I’d previously known it.
Somehow — just a guess — that afternoon I might have become a character
in a science-fiction novel. As a matter of fact, I had only recently
finished rereading Walter M. Miller,Jr.’s sci-fi classic <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0060892994/ref=nosim/?tag=tomdispatch-20"><em>A
Canticle for Leibowitz</em></a>, last visited in 1961 at age 17.
It’s about a world ravaged by humanity (using nukes, as a matter of
fact) and, so many years later, still barely in recovery mode.</p>
<p>I must admit that the streets I was traversing certainly looked like
they existed on just such a planet. After all, the ambience had a
distinctly end-of-the-world (at least as I’d known it) feel to it.</p>
<p>Oh, wait! I checked the news online and it turns out that it was
neither Mars, nor a sci-fi novel. It was simply my very own city, New
York, engulfed in smoke you could smell, taste, and see, vast clouds of
it blown south from Canada where <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/09/world/canada/quebec-canada-wildfires-locations.html">more
than 400 wildfires</a> were then burning in an utterly out of control,
historically unprecedented fashion across much of that country — as, in
fact, all too many of them still are. That massive cloud of smoke
swamped my city’s streets and <a
href="https://www.newsweek.com/before-after-pictures-smoke-new-york-1805322">enveloped</a>
its most famous buildings, bridges, and statues in a horrifying
mist.</p>
<p>That day, New York, where I was born and have lived much of my life,
<a
href="https://www.indiatimes.com/trending/social-relevance/new-york-overtakes-new-delhi-to-have-worst-air-quality-index-605225.html">reportedly
had</a> the worst, most polluted air of any major city on the planet —
<a
href="https://www.cbsnews.com/philadelphia/news/philadelphia-air-quality-smoke-fire-canada-wildfire/">Philadelphia</a>
would take our place the very next day — including an air quality index
that hit a previously unimaginable <a
href="https://www.juancole.com/2023/06/courtesy-canadian-smokestorm.html">484</a>.
That day, my city was headline-making in a way not seen since September
11, 2001. In fact, you might think of that Wednesday as the
climate-change version of 9/11, a terror (or at least terrorizing)
attack of the first order.</p>
<p>Put another way, it should have been a signal to us all that we — New
Yorkers included — now live on a new, significantly <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/07/us/wildfire-smoke-safety-asthma-high-risk.html">more
dangerous</a> planet, and that June 7th may someday be remembered
locally as a preview of a horror show for the ages. Unfortunately, you
can count on one thing: it’s barely the beginning. On an overheating
planet where humanity has yet to bring its release of greenhouse gasses
from the burning of coal, oil, and natural gas under any sort of
reasonable control, where summer sea ice is almost certain to be a <a
href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/06/world/arctic-sea-ice-free-climate-change/index.html">thing
of the past</a> in a <a
href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/the-arctic-is-warming-nearly-four-times-faster-than-the-rest-of-the-world">fast-heating
Arctic</a>, where sea levels are rising ominously and fires, storms, and
droughts are growing more severe by the year, there’s so much worse to
come.</p>
<p>In my youth, of course, a Canada that hadn’t even made it to summer
when the heat hit record levels and fires began burning out of control
from Alberta in the west to Nova Scotia and Quebec in the east would
have been unimaginable. I doubt even Walter M. Miller, Jr., could have
dreamed up such a future, no less that, as of a week ago, <a
href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/canadas-wildfires-air-quality-warnings-connected-climate-change/story?id=99905554">1,400%</a>
of the normal acreage of that country, or more than 8.7 million acres,
had already burned (with so much more undoubtedly still to come); nor
that Canada, seemingly caught unprepared, without <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/09/world/canada/canada-firefighting-capacity.html">faintly
enough firefighters</a>, despite recent all-too-flammable summers — <a
href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/hundreds-of-american-firefighters-arrive-in-canada-to-help-battle-wildfires-1.6432188">having</a>,
in fact, to <a
href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/alberta-wildfires-university-of-alberta-jen-beverly-andrew-1.6863691">import
them</a> from around the world to help bring those blazes under some
sort of control — would be in flames. And yet, for that country,
experiencing its fiercest fire season ever, one thing seems guaranteed:
that’s only the beginning. After all, United Nations climate experts are
now suggesting that, by the end of this century, if climate change isn’t
brought under control, the intensity of global wildfires could rise by
<a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/07/canadas-wildfires-new-climate-reality-experts-officials-say">another
57%</a>. So, be prepared, New Yorkers, orange is undoubtedly the color
of our future and we haven’t seen anything like the last of such smoke
bombs.</p>
<p>Oh, and that June evening, once I was home again, I turned on the <a
href="https://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news-netcast/video/nightly-news-full-broadcast-june-7th-180966469551">NBC
nightly news</a>, which not surprisingly led with the Canadian fires and
the smoke disaster in New York in a big-time way — and, hey, in their
reporting, no one even bothered to mention climate change. The words
went unused. My best guess: maybe they were all on Mars.</p>
<p><strong>Been There, Done That</strong></p>
<p>In fact, you could indeed think of that June 7th smoke-out as the
2023 climate-change equivalent of September 11, 2001. Whoops! Maybe
that’s a far too ominous comparison and I’ll tell you why.</p>

<p>On September 11, 2001, at the World Trade Center in New York, the
Pentagon in Washington, and aboard four hijacked jets, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_September_11_attacks">almost
3,000 people died</a>. That was indeed a first-class nightmare, possibly
the worst terrorist attack in history. And the U.S. responded by
launching a set of invasions, occupations, and conflicts that came to be
known as “the global war on terror.” In every sense, however, it
actually turned out to be a global war <em>of</em> terror, a
20-plus-year disaster of losing conflicts that involved the killing of
staggering numbers of people. The latest estimate from the invaluable
Costs of War Project is: <a
href="https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/figures/2021/WarDeathToll">almost
a million</a> direct deaths and possibly <a
href="https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/papers/2023/IndirectDeaths">3.7
million</a> indirect ones.</p>
<p>Take that in for a moment. And think about this: in the United
States, there hasn’t been the slightest penalty for any of that. Just
ask yourself: Was the president who so disastrously invaded Afghanistan
and then Iraq, while he and his top officials <a
href="https://theintercept.com/2023/03/19/george-bush-iraq-lies-trump/">lied
through their teeth</a> to the American people, penalized in any way?
Yes, I do mean that fellow out in Texas who’s become known for his <a
href="https://www.bushcenter.org/events-and-exhibits/portraits-of-courage">portrait
painting</a> in his old age and who, relatively recently, <a
href="https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/george-bush-gaffe-ukraine-iraq-putin-rcna29829">confused</a>
his decision to invade Iraq with Vladimir Putin’s to invade Ukraine.</p>
<p>Or, for that matter, has the U.S. military suffered any penalties for
its record in response to 9/11? Just consider this for starters: the
last time that military actually won a war was in 1991. I’m thinking of
the first Gulf War and that “win” would prove nothing but a prelude to
the Iraq disaster to come in this century. Explain this to me then: Why
does the military that’s proven <a
href="https://tomdispatch.com/war-what-is-it-good-for/">incapable of
winning a war</a> since that 9/11 terror attack still get more money
from Congress than the next — your choice — <a
href="https://www.nationalpriorities.org/blog/2022/06/22/us-still-spends-more-military-next-nine-countries-combined/">9</a>
or <a
href="https://www.pgpf.org/blog/2023/04/the-united-states-spends-more-on-defense-than-the-next-10-countries-combined">10</a>
militaries on this planet combined, and why, no matter who’s in charge
in Washington, including cost-cutting Republicans, does the Pentagon
never — no, absolutely <em>never</em> — see a cut in its
funding, only yet more taxpayer dollars? (And mind you, this is true on
a planet where the real battles of the future are likely to involve fire
and smoke.)</p>
<p>There may indeed be a “debt ceiling” in this country, but there seems
to be no ceiling at all when it comes to funding that military. In fact,
Republican hawks in the Senate <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/01/us/politics/debt-limit-senate.html">only
recently demanded</a> yet more money for the Pentagon in the
debt-ceiling debate (despite the fact that, amid other cuts, its funding
was already guaranteed to rise by 3% or $388 billion). As Senator
Lindsey Graham so classically put it about that (to him) pitiful rise,
“This budget is a win for China.”</p>
<p>Now, I don’t mean to say that there’s been no pain anywhere. Quite
the opposite. American troops sent to Afghanistan, Iraq, and so many
other countries came home <a
href="https://tomdispatch.com/americans-in-pain/">suffering</a>
everything from literal wounds to severe post-traumatic stress syndrome.
(In these years, in fact, the suicide rate among veterans has been <a
href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/military-suicides-rise-15-as-senior-leaders-call-for-action">unnervingly
high</a>.)</p>
<p>And did the American people pay? You bet. Through the teeth, in fact,
in a moment when inequality in this country was already going through
the roof — or, if you’re not one of the <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/07/magazine/billionaires.html">ever-greater
numbers</a> of billionaires, perhaps the floor would be the more
appropriate image. And has the Pentagon paid a cent? No, not for a thing
it’s done (and, in too many cases, is <a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/29/niger-cycle-of-deadly-violence-raises-questions-over-us-counter-terror-role">still
doing</a>).</p>
<p>Consider this the definition of decline in a country that, as Donald
Trump and Ron DeSantis continue to make desperately clear, could be
heading for a place too strange and disturbing for words, a place both
as old as the present president of the United States (should he win
again) and as new as anyone can imagine.</p>
<p><strong>Will the Climate Version of 9/11 Become Daily Life?</strong></p>
<p>Throughout history, it’s true that great imperial powers have risen
and fallen, but lest you think this is just another typical imperial
moment when, as the <a
href="https://tomdispatch.com/clinging-bitterly-to-guns-and-religion/">U.S.
declines</a>, China will rise, take a breath — oops, sorry, watch out
for that smoke! — and think again. As those Canadian wildfires suggest,
we’re no longer on the planet we humans have inhabited these last many
thousand years. We’re now living in a new, not terribly recognizable,
ever more perilous world. It’s not just this country that’s in decline
but Planet Earth itself as a livable place for humanity and for so many
<a
href="https://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/452617-climate-change-is-killing-millions-of-plants-and-animals-and/">other
species</a>. Climate change, in other words, is quickly becoming the
climate emergency.</p>
<p>And as the reaction to 9/11 shows, faced with a moment of true
terror, don’t count on the response of either the United States or the
rest of humanity being on target. After all, as that smoke bomb in New
York suggests, these days, too many of those of us who matter — whether
we’re talking about the climate-change-denying <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/08/us/politics/wildfires-republicans-climate-change.html">Trumpublican
Party</a> or the leaders of the Pentagon — are fighting the wrong wars,
while the major companies responsible for so much of the terror to come,
the giant fossil-fuel outfits, continue to pull in <a
href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/exxon-chevron-shell-conocophillips-record-profits-earnings-oil-companies-most-profitable-year/">blockbuster</a>
— no, <a
href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/big-oil-doubles-profits-blockbuster-2022-2023-02-08/">record</a>!
— profits for destroying our future. And that simply couldn’t be more
dystopian or, potentially, a more dangerously smoky concoction. Consider
that a form of terrorism even al-Qaeda couldn’t have imagined. Consider
all of that, in fact, a preview of a world in which a horrific version
of 9/11 could become daily life.</p>
<p>So, if there is a war to be fought, the Pentagon won’t be able to
fight it. After all, it’s not prepared for increasing numbers of smoke
bombs, <a
href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/western-megadrought-is-the-worst-in-1-200-years/">scorching
megadroughts</a>, ever more powerful and <a
href="https://www.npr.org/2023/03/01/1160302594/why-is-climate-change-causing-hurricanes-to-be-stronger">horrific
storms</a>, melting ice, <a
href="https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/pace-rise-global-sea-level-has-doubled-un-climate-report-2023-04-21/">rising
sea levels</a>, <a
href="https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/parts-china-sees-record-breaking-temperatures-2023-03-09/">broiling
temperatures</a>, and so much more. And yet, whether you’re American or
Chinese, that’s likely to sum up our true enemy in the decades to come.
And worse yet, if the Pentagon and its Chinese equivalent find
themselves in a war, Ukraine-style or otherwise, over the island of
Taiwan, you might as well kiss it all goodbye.</p>
<p>It should be obvious that the <a
href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/092915/5-countries-produce-most-carbon-dioxide-co2.asp">two
greatest</a> greenhouse gas producers, China and the United States, will
rise or fall (as will the rest of us) on the basis of how well (or
desperately poorly) they cooperate in the future when it comes to the
overheating of this planet. The question is: Can this country, or for
that matter the world, respond in some reasonable fashion to what’s
clearly going to be climate terror attack after terror attack
potentially leading to dystopian vistas that could stretch into the
distant future?</p>
<p>Will humanity react to the climate emergency as ineptly as this
country did to 9/11? Is there any hope that we’ll act effectively before
we find ourselves on a version of Mars or, as Donald Trump, Ron
DeSantis, and others like them clearly wish, fossil-fuelize ourselves to
hell and back? In other words, are we truly fated to live on a smoke
bomb of a planet?</p>
