<p><strong>Londrina, June 1966</strong></p>
<p class="intro">This is a time of intense activity in the kindergarten. The school
vacation period has begun and the children come in droves to do
needlework, even the boys. So, with barely a pause for breath, I am busy
teaching them how to manipulate the needles, stitch and undo the
stitches again, unravel thread. Some also learn to knit.</p>
<p>After my vacation in July, I might start an arithmetic class. Mental
arithmetic or, for example, how to construct a cube with certain
dimensions, is not taught in the marginal schools. They don't know how
to draw a three-inch line with a ruler. Very few vendors know how to
multiply. In secondary school, however, they learn more mathematics than
in Germany.'</p>
<p>God protect us from missionaries. A missionary has been in the favela
since yesterday scaring people into church with loud, croaking music. No
method is too dumb to lure the people to church: German and American
military music, Mozart's A Little Night Music, The River Kwai March pour
over the huts in ear-splitting waves from loud-speakers. No sooner is
mass over than canvassing for the next event begins: meetings with
married women and widows, then for single girls, then come the fathers
and widowers. (They shouldn't beget so many children, the priest tells
them - but how?!) Marriages and baptisms are diligently performed, but
in heaven's name not for illegitimate children, who were conceived in
sin. The church considers such details un-Christian. But it seems to be
Christian when a Catholic priest says that we should only distribute
medicine in our favela, and send the other sick people home.</p>
<p>Sometimes the children can make me quite angry. I noticed just in
time that Darcy was throwing away his leftover sugar after the
milk-break. <em>Nao 'tou fome mais nao</em>. He's full, he says. And
tomorrow? I don't know about tomorrow.</p>
<p>No one would guess that this child comes from a slum, that his
parents emigrated from the hunger-stricken north to find work on the
coffee plantations in Paran√°. The same children who are wasteful with
sugar in the morning scramble crying for a few grains of rice that have
fallen from a donkey-cart in the afternoon; or share one sweet among
five of them.</p>
<p>The favela children, despite knowing hunger, have as little concept
of the value of things as the rich. How often do they say: my father
lost his job and we have nothing to eat. In spite of this, neither the
children nor their parents have a concept of saving or provision and
planning for the future. <em>Se Deus quiser</em>, if God wills,
everything will be all right. Is this fatalism and living only for today
an unchangeable basic characteristic, or a mental attitude developed
over the centuries which can be changed through education, by awakening
their slumbering capacities by means of training in thinking? Education
by experience is apparently not sufficient.</p>
<p>But nothing will be achieved if the schools stay the way they are:
schools for parrots who are bored to death memorizing the names of
rivers and mountain ranges which aren't even shown to them on a map; of
kings and explorers whose origins and aims remain unknown. Instead of
motivating the children, they suffocate their desire to learn, their
natural curiosity and joy of discovery through monotonous boredom.</p>
<p>It would be good if they could work together in groups: crafts,
reading fairy tales and myths, exploration trips, sports to learn
fairness, to learn to differentiate between beauty and kitsch by means
of art appreciation. The children should be given problems to solve and
objectives to be attained, so they will realize that in later life
objectives must be set and that thinking precedes acting.</p>
<p>But who will give the favela children such schools of thinking? The
politicians and the rich have no wish to stimulate the spirit of
criticism and reflection, for this criticism would eventually be
directed against them. And the poor do not possess the means. It's
beyond their strength. And it would result in the "revolution from
below".</p>
<p><strong>1966</strong></p>
<p>Today I received a letter from Brigitte, a school friend, in which
she writes about the affluence ecstasy in Germany. I wonder why we are
trying to elevate the favelas to the middle-class when the members of
the latter are so desolate, mediocre, satiated, limited in interest to
their stomachs, beds, automobiles and television.</p>
<p>Probably I have no right to ask this, coming as I do from the
middle-class, because I don't know, don't really know what it's like to
live in a leaking, wind-bent hut, and to have a stomach which contains
more worms than food. And the ascent of the favelados to the
middle-class - apart from the fact that it may be inevitable, the
question being when and how - would probably be good if only because of
the few people who aren't satisfied with a full stomach, but who use
their heads and seek a real meaning in life.</p>
<p><strong>Londrina, August 1966</strong></p>
<p>The knitting bug has invaded the favela. The children teach their
sisters and brothers and their mothers. Often you see them with their
knitting on street corners and in the playground teaching each other. I
didn't know where to get enough wool. Luckily, I am now able to buy
leftovers cheaply at Fuganti's department store.</p>
<p>I want to see if I can arrange an exhibition of the children's work,
perhaps even a bazaar to sell it. It's about time for the rich of the
city to realize that the favela children can also accomplish something,
if only given the chance. A few girls have begun to knit for this
purpose, but it is still somewhat difficult. I tremble with every fallen
stitch. Also the risk that I may be stuck until an advanced old age with
Christmas ornaments, baby clothes, table-cloths, baskets, etc., gives
pause for thought. Maybe their childish enthusiasm will fizzle out as
suddenly as it came, for this present eagerness can hardly long endure.
Last week I started to knit bigger things with some of the children and
thought they would be kept busy for the next two weeks. But the caps
were ready in two days and I had to think of something else.</p>
<p>Virginia's father just appeared, drunk again. The kitchen door opened
and a brown hand laid a pair of socks on the dresser. I went onto the
kitchen porch and saw him washing our towels and hang them carefully out
to dry. He only said <em>boa tarde</em>, good afternoon, and carried on,
as though it were the most natural thing in the world for him to be
washing our towels on Sunday. When he could find nothing else to wash he
thanked me and left. Surely this was his way of thanking me for the
sweater I gave his daughter. He probably had to sell his horse, on which
he always galloped past our dining-room window. To compensate he came
today in a fire-red shirt. He lives in the very last hut of the favela,
which is almost invisible because of the cacti climbing over it. His six
year old daughter was burned with boiling water when she was three. The
wound is still open.</p>

today in a fire-red shirt. He lives in the very last hut of the favela,
which is almost invisible because of the cacti climbing over it. His six
year old daughter was burned with boiling water when she was three. The
wound is still open.</p>
<p><strong>Londrina, August 1966</strong></p>
<p>It is uncomfortably cold. The Brazilians, especially the blacks, are
quite hardened to it and freeze less than we. Recently I saw a black man
sitting in front of his hut naked to the waist when the temperature was
just below freezing. I shivered just looking at him. I woke up today and
looked out the window: everything white! hoarfrost. It froze overnight.
You can imagine the panic of the coffee planters. The first coffee buds
are dead, the leaves hang black and limp on the trees; a pitiful sight.
Conversation-piece number 1: the burnt coffee. Strangely enough they say
burnt instead of frozen. Probably because it is not the frost itself
that causes the damage, but the morning sun shining on the iced-over
leaves. This year's harvest has just been brought in. The damage is
therefore to next year's crop, 50-60% loss, according to the
newspapers.</p>
<p>If it weren't for the workers, many of whom are being laid off and
therefore must bear the brunt of the loss, it would be the best and
cheapest way to get rid of the coffee. Instead of burning it after years
of storage, it is burned already on the tree, so it doesn't have to be
picked, cleaned, transported or stored. Over thirty thousand sacks are
stored, while at the most fourteen thousand sacks are exported yearly.
The fazendeiros, ringing their hands, wait for rain, so that the second
buds may appear. Coffee blossoms three times. Therefore black
(over-ripe), red (ripe) and green (unripe) beans hang simultaneously on
the same plant. Ripe and unripe beans are "picked" at the same time,
that is, knocked from the tree with a stick and gleaned from the ground.
That's the reason for the poor quality of Brazilian coffee. We wonder
why the planters haven't yet realized that there are more important
crops than coffee so they could pull out at least the unproductive trees
in order to plant rice, beans and wheat. Beans are imported from Mexico
in exchange for valuable hard currency. The state now gives subsidies
for every plucked out unproductive coffee tree and only gives credit for
so-called "white agriculture" (rice, wheat, soy beans, etc. and cattle),
which causes the coffee aristocracy to cry like stuck pigs. What they
must put up with, and how unthankful is the state, especially since they
bring in the hard currency in the first place.</p>
<p>Although the planters claim that their workers are protected, they
are laid off <em>en masse</em> and stream into the city. The prefecture
courtyard looks like a refugee camp. The empty coffee warehouses on the
periphery of the city serve as emergency shelters. Now and then beggars
come to the favela looking for something to eat. In their eyes the
people in the favela are lucky, because they at least have a roof over
their heads.</p>
<p>Yesterday I was at a German fazenda (farm) and spoke with the
workers. A Russian woman works there who had been carried off by German
soldiers in 1943, met a Pole in a concentration camp whom she eventually
married, but had to emigrate as a displaced person after the war and
arrived here with nothing. She has been working for the German fazenda
owners, mostly in the kitchen, for twelve years. Her husband, who earns
$150 per month, is the administrator of the farm. When he is ill he
earns nothing. His son earns 30 cents an hour. With a ten-hour workday,
he just about earns the <em>salario</em> <em>minimo</em>. He is always
on duty, even when the <em>senhor </em>calls for him at night. I asked
him if they are helped in case of sickness, if anyone cares for the
workers' children, if the young girls are given the opportunity to learn
something. Nothing! But many fazenda owners of German descent preach to
us about humanity and sacrifice: One must really do something for the
poor, who after all are so adept and willing to work. I asked the
Russian lady if this doesn't make her furious.</p>
<p>No, they are quite human, at least they speak to us.</p>
<p>The same fazendeiros who do nothing for their own workers jump on the
aid for development band-wagon as soon as they smell an advantage for
their social prestige. Why is it that the same person who deducts the
cost of rent, firewood and the use of the football field from his
workers' meager wages is the same person who builds a clinic for the
poor in the city? The reason: one happens in silence, the other in
public view accompanied by the applause of the press and the acclaim of
<em>sociedade</em>. It almost seems as if money for development is made
available in order to enhance the prestige of a rich minority. How
sensible!</p>
<p><strong>Londrina, October, 1966</strong></p>
<p>During the past few weeks we have done a lot of work on the
kindergarten with the boys of the favela, whitewashed the building,
painted the chairs and tables, put in window-panes, planted flowers and
dug a pit for high and long-jumping. When the kindergarten, together
with surroundings, stood ready in its new splendor, self-made, so to
speak, we were all very proud. It is quite different if a kindergarten
is placed ready-made into its surroundings, or if it is just a shell
which the children beautify by their own efforts and make their own. It
is infuriating how German technicians from the GDS are used to nail
boards together to make wooden houses and to excavate ditches, instead
of having them teach the masses of unemployed youths in the favela to do
their own work. It's really a pity! They are cooperative, adroit,
interested, not lazy, but at an age when they should be preparing
themselves for a trade, they do absolutely nothing. They no longer go to
school, they have outgrown the work they did as ten-year-olds
(shoe-shine boys, scrap paper collectors) and they don't find other
work. After the coffee froze almost all minors were laid off to make
room for the unemployed agricultural workers, so they accustom
themselves to sweet idleness. They aren't bored, because there is always
a group hanging around for fun.</p>
<p>Training courses or trade schools which would take the young people
off the streets ‚Äì that would be true development and would really
benefit the poor. There are very few such GDS projects however. It makes
no sense for Adolf and Kaspar to be making small houses when any
Brazilian carpenter could do it just as well. Could...if the GDS people
weren't around to take the work away from them. Strangest of all is that
the GDS doesn't understand the absurdity. <em>Cabeca dura demais</em> -
pigheaded. (The GDS have since learned from such experiences.)</p>
<p>With respect to my exhibition, I waver hourly between great
enthusiasm and thinking that it will be completely impossible. We have
made tablecloths with matching napkins using hem and cross-stitches. The
abstract patterns and stitch counting are very difficult for some
children; the boys usually do it better than the girls, which makes them
very proud. Weaving with bast is easier because the work process is
clearer. They also now understand that you cannot just select any color,
that colors often clash. It is certainly good for them not to see only
manufactured junk around them, but also pretty things which they can
make. Native crafts which exist in countries that have ancient cultures
don't exist here, except for the bone-lace of Bahia. The handicrafts of
the original Indian inhabitants disappeared along with their culture as
a result of the collision with European culture. The Portuguese masters,
plantation owners, didn't respect handicrafts, so an artisan class never
developed. The lack of this tradition is making itself felt now during
the industrialization process. A factory in a country in which the
carpenter's trade, with apprentice and master carpenters, didn't exist
in pre-industrial times results ‚Äì at least at the present stage ‚Äì in
work of inferior quality. Our sloppily joined closets and beds that fall
apart are prime examples.</p>
<p><strong>Londrina, November 1966</strong></p>
<p>In general, life in the favela is peaceful and calm. But now and then
this smooth surface cracks under the pressure of poverty or passion.
Recently a woman lay in wait on a street corner for a girl from our
favela and killed her with a kitchen-knife because she was living with
the woman's husband. Then she went directly to the police and said, Lock
me up, I want a rest from life. Now both she and her husband are in jail
and their five children have been distributed among relatives. People
help each other because state welfare is ineffective. At best the state
would put the children in jail with their parents. Several children
twelve to thirteen years old have been interned in Londrina's jail for
years because they were once caught stealing.</p>
<p>Or recently: the father of Irany, one of my kindergarten children,
took his revolver out of its box and wanted to kill his wife and twelve
children. Irany had the presence of mind to run out of the house with
his bullets ‚Äì to the kindergarten! The father was fed up with being a
night-watchman and a laborer during the day, all to barely feed his
family. The next day he left them.</p>
<p>The Londrina jail isn't a pleasant place to pass the time. Twenty to
thirty prisoners are jammed into tiny cells where they all sleep on a
few thin mattresses, with a single bucket serving as the toilet. The
walls are covered with graffiti depicting their wishful thinking. A rich
person wouldn't last a day there. I can only imagine that the rich buy
their freedom, or that there are also first-class jails. Many criminals
are released so they can care for their families; they must report
weekly to the police.</p>
<p>There are fewer drunks than one would expect, considering how cheap
<em>pinga</em> (sugarcane liquor) is. But when they do get drunk they go
all out. A few day ago we were playing, about forty children and adults,
on the street in the fresh evening air, when a group of boys being
chased by a drunk armed with a brick came running toward us. Screaming,
everyone tried to get into the nearest house, with the drunk after them.
There was total panic. Forty people trying to get through a tiny doorway
at the same time. I grabbed a two-year old and stood in the shade of a
tree waiting for them to come out. The woman of the house dropped the
egg she was about to fry. Men in this condition are so dangerous because
they are almost always carrying a knife. The police were called.</p>
<p>In Brazil crime is elementary and spontaneous, conceived in a
passionate, uncontrolled instant and, above all, perpetrated against a
certain individual. A murder is committed for a specific motive
(jealousy, insult, etc.) and involves a certain person and no other.
Murderer and victim are related by personal contact. Not like in Germany
and other so-called civilized countries where unknown people are
murdered, where lack of social contact engenders anonymous aggression,
which is directed against defenseless people as revenge against society
in general. Murder in Brazil is (except for political murder committed
by professional assassins, <em>capanzas</em>), strange at it sounds,
more "human". As long as you have no personal enemies you are safer in a
favela than in a European metropolis.</p>
<p>The longer I live together with the favela people, the clearer it
becomes to me that the Brazilian people, especially the poorer classes,
are uprooted, and at many levels. Even outwardly, in respect of origins.
Brazil was discovered, explored and colonized by the Portuguese. Later
immigrants arrived from Germany, Italy, Poland, Russia, Syria and,
increasingly, Japan. And, of course, the involuntary immigrants.
Thousands of blacks were abducted to work on the sugar plantations, were
torn from their homes like weeds from the earth. From Africa they
brought with them their Gods, their Macumba-cult, their ritual songs. So
Brazil's roots are in Europe on one hand and Africa on the other. Until
the First World War the center of gravity was the northeast, Bahia and
Minas Gerais. With the decline of the sugar monoculture and the economic
center's shift to the south (Sao Paulo, Paran√°), many lost their homes
for the second time. Thousands migrated south seeking work on the sugar
plantations and the newly developing industries. Most landed in favelas.
They aren't driven from their homes for political reasons, but by
hunger, drought, unemployment and the government's reluctance to
energetically tackle the problems of the northeast. It is difficult to
imagine the mobility of the poor. In times of drought, vague rumors that
work is available in other parts of the country are sufficient to
mobilize vast armies of people, on foot, or by train or truck.
Industrial centers such as Sao Paulo, Belo Horizonte and Recife attract
them like magnets. This is also why nostalgia for <em>minha terra, minha
namorada</em> (my land, my loved-one) is the theme of so many folk-songs
and pop hits.</p>
<p>This mobility leads to a second uprooting. Despite their lack of
freedom and their poverty, the slaves lived in relative security because
of the land-owners' patriarchal attitude, at least in the 18/19
centuries. After the freeing of the slaves the poverty remained, but the
security was gone. The ex-slaves became the industrial and agricultural
proletariat, to be fired at any time, continually seeking employment.
Industrialization and mechanization have a negative effect on the poor.
It is true that new jobs are created -- but at what of wage level?
Profits are for the rich. And isn't it true that capital influx from the
"first world" only serves to intensify this tendency?</p>
<p>Theocratic thinking and patriarchal attitudes and their related
agrarian system were replaced by industrialization, accompanied by its
way of thinking and its social order. People no longer live in the
stable framework of a tribe or clan which dictates the laws of life.
They no longer find support in myths, art, folk-songs and dances. They
have forgotten their intuitive knowledge and natural healing methods.
There are only vestiges of these to be seen. The Macumba cult, mixed
with Catholicism and the worship of saints, is only partially
understood. Due to the invasion of technology in their lives, the
traditional commitment to their Gods has been lost, their ancient
culture has become unintelligible to them, without a substitute existing
for what has been lost. The knowledge which is passed on from generation
to generation about, for instance, education or work methods, is lost or
ignored, but there are too few schools to replace that knowledge with
another which corresponds to the necessities of the times. Another
example: Macumba is decadent, but there is no church which gives the
poor a new religious understanding. Religious instruction is limited to
memorizing prayers and church hymns.</p>
<p>Thus the poor oscillate between two worlds, separated from one and
not yet accepted in the other. They suffer spiritual as well as physical
hunger.</p>
<p><strong>Londrina, December 1966</strong></p>
<p>We are preparing for Christmas. We intend to have a big celebration
for all the favela children. A meeting takes place every Saturday and
there is an abundance of things to fix and to make ‚Äì hundreds of paper
stars for a sky-tent, a small fence to separate the audience from the
"actors", a wardrobe to change in, etc. Otalino is "chief artisan", Cido
is "<em>Maitre de Plaisir</em>", he rehearses verses, dances and songs.
It is a true trial of patience. Someone is always absent from
rehearsals. They don't feel like it, or have to help their mothers, or
they just sit apathetically in the corner (which is understandable, as
the kindergarten is like an oven in the afternoon), and after a
half-hour most of them want to dance and sing according to their own
fantasy. Then I think as, dripping with sweat, I cry <em>silencio
</em>at children who lose all control when music is playing, that I am
ripe for the GDS medal. But it is well known that for that you have to
be where the medals are awarded, not where they are earned.</p>
<p>As I was thinking about how to make a Christmas crib scene, my
mother's <em>Weg zur Krippe</em> (The Way to the Crib) arrived. We found
it so beautiful that we started cutting out with great enthusiasm till
late in the afternoon and with growling stomachs, for the children
decided it would be a waste to break for lunch. We also have a Christmas
tree, a small araukery, the symbol of Paran√°. Costumes for the Queen of
the celebration, the kings, Indians, dancers, doormen, curtain-openers,
waitresses as well as the Christmas tree decorations are all finished.
Now we are baking a mountain of cornmeal cookies for us and the
audience; the only thing lacking is cold and snow. It's 90 degrees
outside and the red earth reflects back the shimmering heat.</p>
<p><strong>Londrina, January 1967</strong></p>
<p>The parcel with the work material is here. I rushed to the post
office and found a half-shredded parcel. With the worst presentiment I
ran down the hill to the favela, feeling it all over. In my mind I could
see the customs official's wife with the pearls around her neck, but
<em>gracas a Deus</em> my fears were unfounded: everything has arrived.
Opening it was pure joy, together with Tereza, Cido, Otalino and other
children. They all experienced the arrival and opening of a parcel for
the first time. Solemnly they handed each little package to me, which I
opened, and they stood around watching in amazement, oh oh-ing. They
were all thrilled with the pearls and wanted to start stringing them
immediately.</p>
<p>We began the day before yesterday and today there are hardly any
pearls left. The first night we sat working until one o'clock in the
morning in my room and at eight we were at work again. About 30 strings
of pearls are now ready, some of them really ripe for display. The time
has come to have the bazaar, but where?</p>
<p>We have begun weaving. But our minds are mainly on corn. We used the
corn harvest for a corn festival. Together with Zeca, Otalino, and Cido,
I went to a fazenda to pick up three large sacks. We met at 6 a.m., when
it was still dark, in order to arrive there early. Lunch consisted
exclusively of corn, roasted in a fire. In the afternoon we really got
going though. We tried out various Brazilian (or rather Indian)
specialties: one husked the corn, another ground it fine, still another
pressed it through a cloth. It sprayed in all directions and the dark
faces were sprinkled white. Another formed bags from the corn husks in
which the corn meal was placed and then cooked in hot water. The result
is called <em>pamonha</em>, a kind of corn cake. For dessert me made
<em>curral</em>, corn pudding. The only thing lacking was corn whiskey,
but even without it we were intoxicated by corn. Soon we will be walking
around in corn slippers and will lay the fruit in corn bowls, then the
remaining husks will be dried out and used for handicrafts.</p>
<p>A characteristic of the kindergarten day is the children's
unrestrained chatter. Listening, I learn quite a bit about their way of
life and their feelings. Dalva came running to me today: I am so ugly,
<em>feia mesmo</em> (really ugly). Why was I born so black, I'll have to
marry someone just as black and then my children will be just as ugly
and black as me. She is 16 years old, absolutely not ugly, very clean
and correctly dressed and works as an <em>empregada</em> (maid) in the
city. To her great regret, her skin is dark brown, her hair is frizzled
and her nose is somewhat wide. Her efforts to bleach her skin with a
thick layer of rice powder and to straighten her hair are touching, but
unsuccessful.</p>
<p>In Germany the people lie in the sun to become brown, I tell them.
The children are skeptical.</p>
<p>You seem to think that black and ugly are one and the same. Whites
can be just as ugly as blacks can be beautiful."</p>
<p>Zeca, thirteen years old, a lot of black with some Indian and
Portuguese blood, says: I would much prefer to have straight hair. When
I am collecting old paper and find a nylon stocking, I put it over my
head to control the frizzles.</p>
<p>Twelve year old Maria Jos says she would never marry a black, because
‚Äì my mother says that life is hard enough as it is and the only thing we
have left is our light skin.</p>
<p>In Brazil white seems to be the ideal of beauty. Advertising models,
beauty queens, movie stars are all white. At official functions, in the
clubs and universities, on the fazendas and in the government: all
pale-faces. The reigning color in the favelas, however, is
brown-black.</p>
<p>The average Brazilian associates white with such words as pretty,
rich, clever, initiative. The word "black" indicates characteristics
such as lazy, ugly and childish. These crass value comparisons lead
directly to Brazil's racial prejudices and latent social
confrontations.</p>
<p>You often hear that Brazil is the land of racial equality. It is true
that you can see white, brown and black children playing together in the
slums and going together to school; a young black dates a light-brown
girl. Blacks and whites squeeze into the same bus and sit on the same
park bench. Upon closer examination however, this harmonious surface is
shot through with cracks. There is no racial hatred like in the United
States and South Africa, but that doesn't mean you can deny the
political and social racial discrimination. It would not occur to a
Brazilian to feel physically disgusted by blacks, but the white ruling
class would certainly oppose any black who tried to enter their
exclusive clubs or have an important position in a bank, university or
in the government. They would consider it infiltration and a great
<em>faux pas</em> because it would amount to the entrance of a socially
unfit person into a realm in which, according to the unspoken social
code, he did not belong. If the black keeps to the place assigned to him
by the rich since the times of slavery, that is, in the miserable huts
of the plantations and the favelas; if he works in "his" professions -
laborer, street-sweeper, etc. or, at the most, mechanic or chauffeur; if
he goes to the assigned schools (elementary schools, there are no blacks
to speak of in the universities), he is treated kindly and with true
Brazilian courtesy. The danger that he will work his way up from the
serving to the ruling class is next to non-existent, for it is terribly
difficult in Brazil to go from low to high, even for the
light-skinned.</p>
<p>But if some energetic and talented person tries to overcome the
social barriers, obstacles are put in his way, especially if he is
black. It is relatively easy for a white who eventually rises to a
position in administration or in a bank to become integrated; you can't
see his favela origins in his skin color. For a black, however, all
defenses are well prepared. When a personnel manager must choose between
a white, brown and black employee, the white comes first, then the brown
and last of all the black. Once I spoke with Antonio about the race
problem. He works at the prefecture, his mother is black, his father
white. He believes that as a black he is judged more critically at work
than his white colleagues.</p>
<p>This example of Antonio indicates the possible solution to the racial
question in Brazil: Blacks and whites intermix. The blacks become
lighter, the whites darker; both find themselves to be <em>moreno</em>,
brown-skinned. Thus the problem would be resolved ‚Äì on the surface. But
the question really lies deeply embedded in Brazil's great social
problem: the difference between rich and poor. <em>Os problemas sao
inumerais!</em></p>
<p><strong>Londrina, February 1967</strong></p>
<p>Time flies. It's almost July, when my work here will be at an
end.</p>
<p>My birthday was the occasion for a three-day celebration. It enriched
me with a porcelain penguin of considerable size, two small porcelain
dogs of various breeds and several bowls and dishes. On the previous day
the wood-burning stove was inspected for serviceability, we gathered
wood in a forest and vegetables on abandoned farms. We cooked, roasted,
baked, one cake-pan after the other was shoved into the oven (over 100
children and adults had to be provided for), <em>pipoca</em> (popcorn)
puffed, many tins of <em>mamao-marmalade</em> (a kind of tree melon)
prepared, while we drank cafezinho - it was really gem√ºtlich. I was only
allowed to watch, not lift a hand. If I wanted to intervene, the work
was immediately snatched from my hand. Gelsa baked a twelve-storey
birthday cake! And best of all, the children earned the necessary funds
with their knitting. In the evening we continued the party in Cido's
house. His father's boss donated a barrel of beer to commemorate my
"self-sacrificing" work.</p>
<p>On Sunday the play "Little Red Riding Hood" was performed, twice,
because not everyone fit into the kindergarten at once. Also
extemporized skits about Brazilian comical figures in which the contrast
between country bumpkins and city people lightly touched by civilization
were characterized. The city folk, even the poorest of the favelas,
consider themselves to be on a higher plane. And, in fact, most
favelados are really a step higher on the social ladder. They have
schools, aren't so at the mercy of illness or dependent on the coffee
monoculture.</p>
<p><strong>Londrina, April 1967</strong></p>
<p>There was finally an article in <em>Folha de Londrina</em> (Londrina
newspaper) with the elegant headline: I. <em>Exposicao de Artisanato da
Vila de Fraternidade</em> about the <em>voluntarios</em>, that is,
social development workers: our bazaar was opened. Last month (during
Lent, when we were supposed to be calm, diligent and not playful), we
worked like maniacs and when I desperately needed money for more
material, we took courage and went public with our handmade products.
Now we sit every afternoon and evening in the Engineers' club, which was
kindly put at our disposal, selling our necklaces, bracelets, wallets,
book-markers, our embroidered and knitted articles. Between sales we
play quartet (in German!), dance the twist, paint cloth and paper. It is
a lot of fun. In the evening Otalino brings our royal supper: rice and
beans. We sit in a circle around the pot. Everyone helps himself.</p>
<p>Although the exposition is well attended, you can see that most of
the visitors make no attempt to understand what such an accomplishment
means to favela children. Children who until a few months ago never had
a needle in their hands, who no one had ever helped until recently; who,
though enthusiastic, have difficulty with sustained work, and are now
experiencing how High Society comes to admire what they have
accomplished. For the children it is a wonderful experience. For the
rich it is, unfortunately, just another way to spend their free
time.</p>
<p>While we were preparing the bazaar and exposition, hordes of powdered
and painted "society ladies" came fluttering around to see the children
at work. It is strange how little contact they have with the lower
classes and how insecure they are even with the children. Made somewhat
uncomfortable by the closeness of the room, the numerous shabbily
dressed children and the smell of poverty, they don't have more to say
than <em>que bonitinho</em> (oh, how nice). With many promises to return
with work material, they disappear never to be seen again.</p>
<p>There seem to be two Brazils. The one that Europeans know: white
population, American style skyscrapers, Catholicism, in short, a
tropical Europe. Then the other Brazil: colored, living in poverty, with
a culture and religion which don't derive only from European
Christianity, but also from African and Indian tribal cultures. And both
parts feel Brazilian. The gap between the upper and lower classes isn't
only that of the unequal division of wealth. The contrast is more
profound than that of rich and poor. Two different worlds seem to exist
alongside each other, without touching, without mutual
understanding.</p>
<p>Even the origins of the upper and lower classes is different. In
general, the upper class is composed of the descendants of Portuguese
colonialists and later European immigrants. The lower class largely
consists of blacks and mixtures of Black, Indian and European. Europeans
and European consciousness opposed to Afro-Indian origin and Afro-Indian
consciousness. The former is immersed in the development of the
intellect and will to freedom, while the latter don't yet seem to be
able to utilize to the full their intellect and reason (which doesn't
mean that they are stupid!). They are in the process of emerging from an
existence devoid of history, unburdened by questions of where to? why?
where from? Mostly their lives are unorganized, without orientation
(Where am I in the past, present and future? What is my place in
society? Is this place just, changeable, or ordained by God?).</p>
<p>Modern thinking and mechanization have uprooted these people and they
have lost their culture through contact with Europeans. Therefore the
argument that they have always been poor and why should they suddenly be
different, is not valid. They already suffer the negative effects of
industrialization; it is only just that they also enjoy some of the
blessings of civilization.</p>
<p><strong>Londrina, June 1967</strong></p>
<p>After not having rained for three months ‚Äì one literally sank
ankle-deep in fine red dust and passing cars covered the houses with
clouds of dust ‚Äì the daily processions praying for rain finally worked:
it is pouring ceaselessly and the soft dust has changed to slippery mud
in a matter of hours.</p>
<p>As July and our departure date is not far off, a good-bye atmosphere
is gradually being felt, as well as a kind of last-minute panic. Our
heads are full of ideas, only time is lacking. Some children want to
learn to crochet, we want to organize a exhibition and a trip to a
nearby river, I want to enroll some boys in the <em>senai</em>-school
(trade school), others in the <em>escoteiros,</em> the Boy Scouts.</p>
<p>Even the Boy Scout movement is for wealthy children. There also only
white faces. By favela standards the uniform alone costs a fortune.
Despite their poverty, Otalino, Zeca and Joao have been accepted. I was
glad that they introduced Brazil's brown element there. Such enthusiasm
has never been seen among the boys of the favela. Whenever our new
Scouts return from their tents or meetings they are immediately
surrounded by a crowd of the curious, to whom they must relate their
experiences in detail.</p>
<p>We are rehearsing the quadrilla, a folk-dance that will be performed
during the St.¬†John's season, on the Sao Joao, Sao Pedro and Sant'
Antonio holidays. A children's wedding is also part of a real quadrilla.
Tereza as the bride has been talking for months about this, the happiest
day of her nine-year-old life. Her bridegroom takes his happiness more
calmly -- he is, after all, only eight. The wedding is performed by a
thirteen-year-old priest in the "church", an empty house which we have
decorated with an altar, pictures of saints and flowers. The wedding
dance and dinner follow, and in the evening you sit around the fire
roasting mandioca-roots and sweet potatoes, pine-kernels and
<em>churrasquinho</em>, pieces of meat on a spit. The whole favela is
invited. You can imagine the crowd and the congestion.</p>
<p><strong>Santos, August 2, 1967</strong></p>
<p>I'm going home! It's hard to believe. I'm sitting here in the port of
Santos on the same bench as two years ago, while Kaspar is looking after
the tickets. One day walking around Sao Paulo, one day walking around
Santos and today, we hope, <em>se Deus quiser</em>, we sail for
Genoa.</p>
<p>Maybe I'll come back soon. Dona Lina, the president of a Women's
assistance association who obtained the space for our exhibition, has
had for years the idea to organize work-at-home so that women may earn
something extra by selling homemade articles. Many work in the city as
maids or do laundry for the rich, but this involves the disadvantage
that they must work regular hours and therefore leave their children
alone. Something similar has already been done with success in Sao
Paulo: One favela weaves, for example, another crochets, a third sews
and a fourth knits (on a knitting machine bought on credit and paid off
monthly with the proceeds of the work). A senhora from sociedade is
responsible for a certain favela, teaches the women how to do the work
and then organizes the sale in a Sao Paulo shopping center. Dona Lina
has something similar in mind for Londrina and as I know at least one of
the favelas better than the Londrina rich do, and as I already began
something in this direction with our bazaar-exhibition, she thinks I
should help her to tackle this initiative.</p>
<p>Thank God the farewell from the Vila is over. The whole gang brought
me to the train. The station has probably never seen so much shouting,
hooting, viv√° calls and running after the departing train. Today I leave
Brazilian soil and on the 20th of August arrive in Italy.</p>
