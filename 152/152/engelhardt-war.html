<h3>Remarkably Little If You're a "Great" Power on Planet Earth in the Twenty-First Century</h3>
<h2>By <a href="https://tomdispatch.com/authors/tomeditor/">Tom Engelhardt</a></h2>

<main>
<p class="intro">I was born on July 20, 1944, amid a vast global conflict already
known as World War II.  Though it ended with the atomic bombings of
Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945 before I could say much more than
“Mama” or “Dada,” in some strange fashion, I grew up at war. </p>
<p>Living in New York City, I was near no conflict in those years or in
any since. My dad, however, had volunteered for the Army Air Corps at
age 35 on December 8, 1941, the day after the Japanese attack on Pearl
Harbor. He fought in Burma, was painfully silent about his wartime
experiences, and died on Pearl Harbor Day in 1983. He was the operations
officer for the 1st Air Commandos and his war, in some strange sense,
came home with him. </p>
<p><span id="anchor"></span>Like so many vets, then and now, he was
never willing to talk to his son about what he had experienced, though
in my early years he still liked his friends to call him “Major,” his
rank on leaving the military.  When his war did come up in our house, it
was usually in the form of anger — because my mother had shopped at a
nearby grocery store whose owners, he claimed, had been “war profiteers”
while he was overseas, or because my first car, shared with a friend,
was a used Volkswagen (German!), or my mom was curious to go — god save
us! — to a Japanese restaurant! </p>
<p>The strange thing, though, was that, in those same years, for reasons
we never discussed, he allowed me briefly to have <a
href="https://tomdispatch.com/bunker-busting-the-nuclear-taboo/">a
Japanese pen pal</a> and, though my dad and I never talked about the
letters that boy and I exchanged, we did soak the stamps off the
envelopes he sent and paste them into our latest Scott stamp album. </p>
<p>As for evidence of my father’s wartime experience, I had two
sources.  In the guest room closet in our apartment, he had an old green
duffle bag, which he’d go through now and then. It was filled to the
brim with everything from Army Air Corps documents to his portable mess
kit and even — though I didn’t know it then — his pistol and bullets
from the war. (I would turn them over to the police upon his death a
quarter-century later.) </p>
<p>Though he wouldn’t talk with me about his wartime experience, I lived
it in a very specific way (or at least so it felt to me then). After
all, he regularly took me to the movies where I saw seemingly endless
versions of war, American-style, from the Indian wars through World War
II.  And when we watched movies of his own conflict (or, in my early
years, replays of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victory_at_Sea"><strong>Victory at
Sea</strong></a> on our TV at home) and he said nothing, that only
seemed to confirm that I was seeing his experience in all its glory, as
the Marines inevitably advanced at film’s end and the “Japs” died in a
spectacle of slaughter without a comment from him. </p>
<p>From those Indian wars on, as I wrote long ago in my book <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/155849586X/ref=nosim/?tag=tomdispatch-20"><strong>The
End of Victory Culture</strong></a>, war was always a tale of their
savagery and our goodness, one in which, in the end, there would be an
expectable “spectacle of slaughter” as we advanced and “they” went
down.  From the placement of the camera flowed the pleasure of watching
the killing of tens or hundreds of nonwhites in a scene that normally
preceded the positive resolution of relationships among the whites.  It
was a way of ordering a wilderness of human horrors into a celebratory
tale of progress through devastation, a victory culture that, sooner or
later, became more complicated to portray because World War II ended
with the atomic devastation of those two Japanese cities and, in the
1950s and 1960s, the <a
href="https://tomdispatch.com/prophesies-then-and-now/">growing
possibility</a> of a future global Armageddon.</p>
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/155849586X/ref=nosim/?tag=tomdispatch-20">

<img class="b" src="engelhardt-war-book-img.png" alt="The End of Victoy Culture" style="width:100%">
<div class="container"><p>Buy the Book!</p></div></div></a>
<p>If war was hell, in my childhood at the movies, killing
<strong>them</strong> wasn’t, whether it was the Indians of the American
West or the Japanese in World War II.</p>
<p>So, yes, I grew up in a culture of victory, one I <a
href="https://tomdispatch.com/in-the-zone-with-g-i-joe/">played out</a>
again and again on the floor of my room.  In the 1950s, boys (and some
girls) spent hours <a
href="https://tomdispatch.com/in-the-zone-with-g-i-joe/">acting out</a>
tales of American battle triumph with generic fighting figures: a crew
of cowboys to defeat the Indians and win the West, a bag or two of
olive-green Marines to storm the beaches of Iwo Jima.</p>
<p>If ours was a sanguinary tale of warfare against savages in which
pleasure came out of the barrel of a gun, on floors nationwide we kids
were left alone, without apparent instruction, to reinvent American
history. Who was good and who bad, who could be killed and under what
conditions were an accepted part of a collective culture of childhood
that drew strength from post-World War II Hollywood.</p>
<h4>What Would My Dad Think?</h4>
<p>Today, 60-odd years later, having never been to war but having
focused on it and written about it for so long, here’s what I find
eerily strange: since 1945, the country with the greatest military on
the planet that, in budgetary terms, now leaves the <a
href="https://ips-dc.org/u-s-still-spends-more-on-military-than-next-nine-countries-combined/">next
nine countries combined</a> in the dust, has never — and let me repeat
that: <strong>never</strong>! — won a war that mattered (despite
engaging in all too many spectacles of slaughter).  Stranger yet, in
terms of lessons learned in the world of adult culture, every lost war
has, in the end, only led this country to <a
href="https://tomdispatch.com/congress-has-been-captured-by-the-arms-industry/">invest
more taxpayer</a> dollars in building up that very military.  If you
needed a long-term formula for disaster in a country threatening to come
apart at the seams, it would be hard to imagine a more striking one. So
long after his death, I must admit that sometimes I wonder what my dad
would think of it all.</p>
<p>Here’s the thing: the American experience of war since 1945 should
have offered an all-too-obvious lesson for us, as well as for the
planet’s other great powers, when it comes to the value of giant
military establishments and the conflicts that go with them.</p>
<p>Just think about it a moment, historically speaking.  That global
victory of 1945, ending all too ominously with the dropping of those two
atomic bombs and the slaughter of possibly <a
href="https://thebulletin.org/2020/08/counting-the-dead-at-hiroshima-and-nagasaki/">200,000
people</a>, would be followed in 1950 by the start of the Korean War. 
The statistics of death and destruction in that conflict were, to say
the least, staggering.  It was a spectacle of slaughter, involving the
armies of North Korea and its ally the newly communist China versus
South Korea and its ally, the United States.  Now, consider the figures:
out of a Korean population of 30 million, as many as <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War">three million may have
died</a>, along with an estimated <a
href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/16/asia/china-south-korea-war-remains-repatriated-intl-hnk-mic-ml/index.html">180,000
Chinese</a> and about <a
href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/2000/06/25/death-miscount-etched-into-history/ab9d6830-b10d-429c-a3b0-cbdbaa3a23d1/">36,000
Americans</a>.  The North’s cities, bombed and battered, were left in
utter ruin, while the devastation on that peninsula was almost beyond
imagining. It was all too literally a spectacle of slaughter and yet,
despite ours being the best-armed, best-funded military on the planet,
that war ended in an all-too-literal draw, a 1953 armistice that has
never — not to this day! — turned into an actual peace settlement. </p>
<p>After that, another decade-plus passed before this country’s true
disaster of the twentieth century, the war in Vietnam — the first
American war I opposed — in which, once again, the U.S. Air Force and
our military more generally proved destructive almost beyond imagining,
while at least a <a
href="https://www.britannica.com/question/How-many-people-died-in-the-Vietnam-War">couple
of million</a> Vietnamese civilians and more than a million fighters
died, along with 58,000 Americans.</p>
<p>And yet, in 1975, with U.S. troops withdrawn, the southern regime we
had supported collapsed and the North Vietnamese military and its rebel
allies in the South took over the country.  There was no tie as there
had been in Korea, just utter defeat for the greatest military power on
the planet.</p>
<h4>The Rise of the Pentagon on a Fallen Planet</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, that other superpower of the Cold War era, the Soviet
Union, had — and this should sound familiar to any American in 2023 — <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet–Afghan_War">sent its massive
military</a>, the Red Army, into… yes, Afghanistan in 1979. There, for
almost a decade, it battled Afghan guerrilla forces <a
href="https://tomdispatch.com/best-of-tomdispatch-chalmers-johnson-the-cia-and-a-blowback-world/">backed
and significantly financed</a> by the CIA and Saudi Arabia (as well as
by a specific Saudi named <a
href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/binladen/etc/cron.html">Osama
bin Laden</a> and the tiny group he set up late in the war called — yes,
again! — al-Qaeda). In 1989, the Red Army limped out of that country,
leaving behind <a
href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet–Afghan_War">perhaps two
million</a> dead Afghans and <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/16/world/last-soviet-soldiers-leave-afghanistan-after-9-years-15000-dead-and-great-cost.html">15,000</a>
of its own dead. Not so long after, the Soviet Union itself imploded and
the U.S. became the only “great power” on planet Earth. </p>
<p>Washington’s response would be anything but a promised “peace
dividend.” Pentagon funding barely dipped in those years. The U.S.
military did manage to invade and occupy the tiny island of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_invasion_of_Grenada">Grenada</a>
in the Caribbean in 1983 and, in 1991, in a highly publicized but
relatively low-level and one-sided encounter, drove Iraqi ruler Saddam
Hussein’s Iraqi troops out of Kuwait in what would later come to be
known as the <strong>First </strong>Gulf War. It would be but a preview
of a hell on Earth to come in this century.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, of course, the U.S. became a singular military power on
this planet, having established <a
href="https://tomdispatch.com/the-all-american-base-world/">at least 750
military bases</a> on every continent but Antarctica.  Then, in the new
century, in the immediate wake of the 9/11 terror attacks, President
George W. Bush and his top officials, incapable of imagining a
comparison between the long-gone Soviet Union and the United States,
sent the American military into — right! — Afghanistan to overthrow the
Taliban government there. A disastrous occupation and war followed, a
prolonged <a
href="https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/costs/human/civilians/afghan">spectacle
of slaughter</a> that would only end after 20 years of blood, gore, and
massive expense, when President Biden pulled the last U.S. forces out
amid chaotic destruction and disorder, leaving — yes, the Taliban! — to
run that devastated country. </p>
<p>In 2003, with the Bush administration’s invasion of Iraq (on the <a
href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/3/20/18274228/ari-fleischer-iraq-lies-george-w-bush-wmds">false
grounds</a> that Saddam Hussein was developing or had weapons of mass
destruction and was somehow linked to Osama bin Laden), the Second Gulf
War began. It would, of course, be a disaster, leaving <a
href="https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/figures/2021/WarDeathToll">several
hundred thousand</a> dead Iraqis in its wake and (as in Afghanistan)
thousands of dead Americans as well.  Another spectacle of slaughter, it
would last for endless years and, once again, Americans would draw <a
href="https://bracingviews.substack.com/p/learning-nothing-from-the-iraq-war">remarkably
few</a> lessons from it.</p>
<p>Oh, and then there’s the war on terror more generally, which
essentially helped spread terror around significant parts of the planet.
Nick Turse recently caught this reality with a single statistic: in the
years since the U.S. first began its counter-terror efforts in West
Africa early in this century, terror incidents there have soared <a
href="https://theintercept.com/2023/04/02/us-military-counterterrorism-niger/">by
30,000%</a>.</p>
<p>And the response to this? You know it all too well. Year after year,
the Pentagon’s budget has only grown and is now heading for the <a
href="https://tomdispatch.com/congress-has-been-captured-by-the-arms-industry/">trillion-dollar
mark</a>.  In the end, the U.S. military may have achieved just one
success of any significance since 1945 by becoming the most valued and
best-funded institution in this country. Unfortunately, in those same
years, in a genuinely strange fashion, America’s wars came home (as they
had in the Soviet Union once upon a time), thanks in part to the spread
of military-style assault rifles, now owned by <a
href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/ar15-rifle-nashville-school-shooting-b2310833.html">one
in 20</a> Americans, and <a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/15/south-dakota-governor-kristi-noem-grandchild-guns-nra">other
weaponry</a> (and the barrage of <a
href="https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/reports/mass-shooting">mass
killings</a> that went with them). And there remains the distinctly
unsettling possibility of some version of a new civil war with all its
Trumpian implications developing in this country.</p>
<p>I doubt, in fact, that Donald Trump would ever have become president
without the disastrous American wars of this century. Think of him, in
his own terrorizing fashion, as “fallout” from the war on terror.</p>
<p>There may never, in fact, have been a more striking story of a great
power, seemingly uncontested on Planet Earth, bringing itself down in
quite such a fashion. </p>
<h4>Last Words</h4>
<p>Today, in Ukraine, we see but the latest grim example of how a
vaunted military, strikingly funded in the wake of the collapse of the
Soviet Union — and I’m talking, of course, about Russia’s army — has
once again been sent into battle against lesser forces with remarkably
disastrous results.  Mind you, Vladimir Putin and crew, like their
American counterparts, should have learned a lesson from the Red Army’s
disastrous experience in Afghanistan in the previous century.  But no
such luck.</p>
<p>There should, of course, be a larger lesson here — not just that
there’s no glory in war in the twenty-first century but that, unlike in
some past eras, great powers are no longer likely to experience success,
no matter what happens on the battlefield.</p>
<p>Let’s hope that the rising power on this planet, China, takes note,
even as it regularly organizes <a
href="https://apnews.com/article/china-military-taiwan-us-7549c646a377f1f199d2cda983573279">threatening
military exercises</a> around the island of Taiwan, while the Biden
administration continues to ominously <a
href="https://www.thenation.com/article/world/philippines-balikatan-war-games-us-military/">heighten</a>
the U.S. military presence in the region.  If China’s leaders truly want
to be successful in this century, they should avoid either the American
or Russian versions of war-making of our recent past. (And it would be
nice if the Cold Warriors in Washington did the same before we end up in
a conflict from hell between two nuclear powers.)</p>
<p>It’s decades too late for me to ask my father what his war truly
meant to him, but at least when it comes to “great” powers and war these
days, one lesson seems clear enough: there simply is nothing great about
them, except their power to destroy not just the enemy, but themselves
as well.</p>
<p>I can’t help wondering what my dad might think if he could look at
this increasingly disturbed world of ours.  I wonder if he wouldn’t
finally have something to say to me about war.</p>
