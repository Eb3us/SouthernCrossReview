<h3>America’s Continuing Quest to Hide Torture</h3>

<main>
<p class="intro">In the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_man%27s_buff#/media/File:Blind-Man&#39;s_Buff,_Paul_Jarrard_&amp;_Sons.JPG">Blindman’s
Buff</a> variation of tag, a child designated as “It” is tasked with
tapping another child while wearing a blindfold. The sightless child
knows the other children, all able to see, are there but is left to
stumble around, using sounds and knowledge of the space they’re in as
guides. Finally, that child does succeed, either by bumping into
someone, peeking, or thanks to sheer dumb luck.</p>
<p>Think of us, the American public, as that blindfolded child when it
comes to our government’s torture program that followed the 9/11
disaster and the launching of the ill-fated war on terror. We’ve been
left to search in the dark for what so many of us sensed was there.</p>
<p><span id="anchor"></span>We’ve been groping for the facts surrounding
the torture program created and implemented by the administration of
President George W. Bush. For 20 years now, the hunt for its
perpetrators, the places where they brutalized detainees, and the
techniques they used has been underway. And for 20 years, attempts to
keep that blindfold in place in the name of “national security” have
helped sustain darkness over light.</p>
<p>From the beginning, the torture program was enveloped in a language
of darkness with its <a
href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2017/01/25/what-are-black-sites-6-key-things-to-know-about-the-cias-secret-prisons-overseas/">secret
“black sites”</a> where savage interrogations took place and the <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0521853249/nationbooks08">endless
blacked-out pages of documents</a> that might have revealed more about
the horrors being committed in our name. In addition, the <a
href="../../../../../../../../../Users/karengreenberg/Desktop/4/mar/12/cia-senate-row-documents-feinstein-brennan">destruction
of evidence</a> and the <a
href="https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/cia-refuses-disclose-interrogation-tape-documents?redirect=cpredirect/39807">squelching
of internal reports</a> only expanded that seemingly bottomless abyss
that still, in part, confronts us. Meanwhile, the courts and the justice
system consistently supported those who insisted on keeping that
blindfold in place, claiming, for example, that were defense attorneys
to be given details about the interrogations of their clients, national
security would somehow be compromised.</p>
<p>Finally, however, more than two decades after it all began, the tide
may truly be turning.</p>
<p>Despite fervid attempts to keep that blindfold in place, the search
has not been in vain. On the contrary, over these last two decades, its
layers have slowly worn away, thread by thread, revealing, if not the
full picture of those medieval-style practices, then a damning set of
facts and images relating to torture, American-style, in this century.
Cumulatively, investigative journalism, government reports, and the
testimony of witnesses have revealed a fuller picture of the places,
people, nightmarish techniques, and results of that program.</p>
<p><strong>First Findings</strong></p>
<p>The fraying of that blindfold took endless years, starting in
December 2002, when <em>Washington Post</em> writers Dana Priest
and Barton Gellman <a
href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2002/12/26/us-decries-abuse-but-defends-interrogations/737a4096-2cf0-40b9-8a9f-7b22099d733d/">reported</a>
on the existence of secret detention and interrogation centers in
countries around the planet where cruel, unlawful techniques were being
used against war-on-terror captives in American custody. Quoting from a
2001 State Department report on the treatment of captives, they wrote,
“The most frequently alleged methods of torture include sleep
deprivation, beatings on the soles of the feet, prolonged suspension
with ropes in contorted positions and extended solitary
confinement.”</p>
<p>Less than a year later, the American Civil Liberties Union, along
with other groups, filed <a
href="https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/torturefoia/legaldocuments/nnACLUFOIArequest.pdf">a
Freedom of Information Act request</a> (the first of <a
href="https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/torturefoia/legaldocuments/index.html">many</a>)
for records pertaining to detention and interrogation in the war on
terror. Their goal was to follow the trail leading to “numerous credible
reports recounting the torture and rendition of detainees” and our
government’s efforts (or the lack thereof) to comply “with its legal
obligations with respect to the infliction of cruel, inhuman, or
degrading treatment or punishment.”</p>
<p>Then, in 2004, the blindfold began to show some initial signs of
wear. That spring, <a
href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/abuse-at-abu-ghraib/">CBS News’s 60
Minutes II</a> showed the first photographs of men held at Abu Ghraib,
an American-controlled prison in Iraq. They were, among other things,
visibly naked, hooded, shackled, and threatened by dogs. Those pictures
sent journalists and legal advocates into a frenzied search for answers
to how such a thing had happened in the wake of the Bush
administration’s invasion of Iraq. By that fall, they had obtained
internal government documents exempting any war on terror captives from
the usual legal protections from cruelty, abuse, and torture. <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Torture-Papers-Road-Abu-Ghraib/dp/0521853249">Documents</a>
also appeared in which specific techniques of torture, renamed “enhanced
interrogation techniques” (EITs), were authorized by top officials of
the Bush administration. They would be used on prisoners in secret CIA
locations around the world (119 men in 38 or more countries).</p>
<p>None of this, however, yet added up to “Tag! I found you!”</p>
<p><strong>Senator Feinstein’s Investigation</strong></p>
<p>Before George Bush left office, <a
href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/the-inside-war">Senator
Dianne Feinstein</a> began a congressional investigation into the CIA
interrogation program. In the Obama years, she would battle to mount a
full-scale one into the torture program, defying most of her colleagues,
who preferred to follow President Obama’s <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/12/us/politics/12inquire.html">advice</a>
to “look forward as opposed to looking backwards.”</p>
<p>But Feinstein refused to back down (and we should honor her courage
and dedication, even as we witness <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/19/us/politics/dianne-feinstein-older-lawmakers-senate.html">the
present drama</a> of her insistence on remaining in the Senate despite a
devastating process of aging).  Instead of retreating, Feinstein only
doubled down and, as chair of the Senate Select Committee on
Intelligence, launched an in-depth investigation into the torture
program’s evolution and the grim treatment of those prisoners at what
came to be known as “CIA black sites.”</p>
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0691216576/ref=nosim/?tag=tomdispatch-20">
<div class="polaroid">
<img class="b" src="greenberg-book-cover.png" alt="Subltle Tools" style="width:100%">
<div class="container"><p>Buy the Book!</p></div></div></a>
<p>Feinstein’s investigator, Daniel Jones, spent years reading through
six million pages of documents. Finally, in December 2014, her committee
issued a <a
href="https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/publications/CRPT-113srpt288.pdf">525-page
“executive summary”</a> of his findings. Yet his full report — 6,700
pages with 35,300 footnotes — remained classified on the grounds that,
were the public to see it, national security might be harmed. Still,
that summary convincingly laid out not just the widespread use of
torture but how it “proved not to be an effective means of obtaining
accurate information.” In doing so, it dismantled the CIA’s
justification for its EITs which rested on “claims of their
effectiveness.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Leon Panetta, Obama’s director of the CIA, conducted an
internal investigation into torture. Never declassified, the <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/21/world/cia-report-found-value-of-brutal-interrogation-was-inflated.html">Panetta
Review</a>, as it came to be known, reportedly found that the CIA had
inflated the value of the information it had gotten with the use of
torture techniques. For example, in the brutal interrogation of the
alleged mastermind of 9/11, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the Agency claimed
that those techniques had elicited information from him that helped
thwart further terrorist plots. In fact, the information had been
obtained from other sources. The review reportedly acknowledged that
EITs were <a
href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/panetta-review-cia_n_6334728">in no
way as effective</a> as the CIA had claimed.</p>
<p><strong>The Cultural Sphere</strong></p>
<p>In those years, bits of light from the cultural world began to
illuminate the dark horror of those enhanced interrogation techniques.
In 2007, after President Bush had acknowledged the use of just such
“techniques” and had moved 14 detainees from the CIA’s black sites to
Guantánamo, his infamous offshore prison of injustice in Cuba,
documentary filmmaker Alex Gibney directed <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/18/movies/18taxi.html"><strong>Taxi
to the Dark Side</strong></a>. It told the story of Dilawar, a taxi
driver in Afghanistan who died in American custody after severe
mistreatment. That film would be one of the earliest public exposés of
cruelty and mistreatment in the war on terror.</p>
<p>But such films <a
href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/zero-dark-thirty-the-report/id1683056140?i=1000613172772">didn’t
always yield</a> doses of light. In 2012, for instance, <em>Zero
Dark Thirty</em>, a movie heavily <a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/11/zero-dark-thirty-cia-access-three-internal-agency-investigations-kathryn-bigelow-mark-boal">influenced
by CIA advisers</a>, argued that those harsh interrogations had helped
keep America safer — specifically by leading U.S. authorities to bin
Laden, a meme often repeated by government officials. In fact, reliable
information leading to bin Laden had been obtained without those
techniques.</p>
<p>Increasingly, however, films began to highlight the voices of those
who had been tortured. <em>The Mauritanian</em>, for example,
was based on <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Guantanamo-Diary/dp/1786891859/ref=asc_df_1786891859/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=509360428472&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=13690828645247236586&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9004228&amp;hvtargid=pla-673603193494&amp;psc=1"><strong>Guantánamo
Diary</strong></a>, a memoir by Mohamedou Ould Slahi<a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/12/us/politics/torture-post-9-11.html">,</a>
a tortured Mauritanian held at that prison for 14 years. Slahi, never
charged, was finally released and returned to Mauritania. As <em>New
York Times</em> reporter <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/12/us/politics/torture-post-9-11.html">Carol
Rosenberg</a> summed up his experience, “The confessions he made under
duress [were] recanted [and] a proposed case against him [was] deemed by
the prosecutor to be worthless in court because of the brutality of the
interrogation.”</p>
<p><strong>Abu Zubaydah</strong></p>
<p>Last year, award-winning documentary filmmaker Alex Gibney once again
gave us a film on torture, <em>The Forever Prisoner</em>,
focused on a Guantánamo detainee, Abu Zubaydah, whose real name is Zayn
al-Abidin Muhammed Husayn. On him, the CIA first tested its harsh
interrogation techniques, claiming he was a leading member of al-Qaeda,
an assumption later disproved. He remains one of only three Gitmo
detainees neither charged by the military commissions at that prison,
nor cleared for release.</p>
<p>Nothing captures the futility of the blindfold — or sometimes even
the futility of lifting it — more than Zubaydah’s story, which was at
the heart of the story of torture in these years. The Senate Select
Committee’s 525-page executive summary referred to him no less than
1,343 times.</p>
<p>Captured in Pakistan in 2002 and first taken to a series of black
sites for interrogation, <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/01/us/politics/un-gitmo-abu-zubaydah.html">Zubaydah</a>
was initially believed to be the third highest-ranking member of
al-Qaeda, a claim later abandoned, along with the allegation that he had
even been a member of that terrorist organization. He was the detainee
for whom enhanced interrogation techniques were first authorized by
National Security Advisor <a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/apr/23/condoleezza-rice-cia-waterboarding">Condoleezza
Rice</a>, relying in part on the Justice Department’s greenlighting of
such techniques as “lawful” rather than as torture (legally forbidden
under both domestic and international law). Joe Margulies, Zubaydah’s
lawyer, <a
href="https://www.nybooks.com/online/2018/09/28/the-innocence-of-abu-zubaydah/">summarized</a>
the horrific techniques used on him this way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“His captors hurled him into walls and crammed him into boxes and
suspended him from hooks and twisted him into shapes that no human body
can occupy. They kept him awake for seven consecutive days and nights.
They locked him, for months, in a freezing room. They left him in a pool
of his own urine. They strapped his hands, feet, arms, legs, torso, and
head tightly to an inclined board, with his head lower than his feet.
They covered his face and poured water up his nose and down his throat
until he began to breathe the water, so that he choked and gagged as it
filled his lungs. His torturers then left him to strain against the
straps as he began to drown. Repeatedly. Until, just when he believed he
was about to die, they raised the board long enough for him to vomit the
water and retch. Then they lowered the board and did it again. The
torturers <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/20/world/20detain.html">subjected
him</a> to this treatment at least eighty-three times in August 2002
alone. On at least one such occasion, they waited too long and Abu
Zubaydah nearly died on the board.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition, as <a
href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-did-abu-zubaydah-lose-his-eye">Dexter
Filkins</a> reported in the <em>New Yorker</em> in
2016, Zubaydah lost his left eye while in CIA custody.</p>
<p>As the Feinstein committee’s <a
href="https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/publications/CRPT-113srpt288.pdf">torture
report</a> makes clear, CIA personnel present at that black site cabled
back to Washington the importance of erasing any information about the
nature of Zubaydah’s interrogation, implicitly acknowledging just how
wrongful his treatment had been. The July 2002 cable asked for
“reasonable assurance that [Abu Zubaydah] will remain in isolation and
incommunicado for the remainder of his life.” CIA higher-ups assured the
agents that “all major players are in concurrence that [Abu Zubaydah]
should remain incommunicado for the remainder of his life.”</p>
<p>Sadly enough, that promise has been kept to this very day. In 2005,
CIA officials <a
href="https://jnslp.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/04_Cox.pdf">authorized
the destruction</a> of the tapes of Zubaydah’s questioning and, never
charged with a crime, he is still in Guantánamo.</p>
<p>And yet, despite the promise that he would remain incommunicado, with
each passing year we learn more about what was done to him. In October
2021, in fact, in the <em>United States v. Zubaydah, </em>the
justices of the Supreme Court for the first time openly discussed his
treatment and Justices Sonia Sotomayer, Neil Gorsuch, and Elena Kagan
publicly <a
href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/2021/20-827_l6gn.pdf">used
the word</a> “torture” to <a
href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/2021/20-827_l6gn.pdf">describe</a>
what was done to him.</p>
<p>Elsewhere as well, the blindfold has been shredded when it comes to
the horror of torture, as ever more of Zubaydah’s story continues to see
the light of day. This May, <a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/2023/may/11/abu-zubaydah-drawings-guantanamo-bay-us-torture-policy">the</a><a
                                                                                                                     href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/2023/may/11/abu-zubaydah-drawings-guantanamo-bay-us-torture-policy"> <em>Guardian</em></a>
published a story about a report done by the Center for Policy and
Research at Seton Hall University Law School that included a series of
40 drawings Zubaydah had made and annotated at Guantánamo. In them, he
graphically depicted his torture at CIA black sites and at that
prison.</p>
<p>The images are beyond grotesque and, like a cacophonous symphony you
can’t turn off, it’s hard to witness them without closing your eyes.
They show beating, shackling from the ceiling, sexual abuse,
waterboarding, confinement in a coffin, and so much more. In one picture
that he titled “The Vortex,” the techniques were combined as Zubaydah —
in a self-portrait — cries out in agony. Attesting to the accuracy of
the scenes he drew, the faces of his torturers have been blacked out by
the authorities to protect their identities.</p>
<p>As the <em>Guardian</em>’s Ed Pilkington reported, Helen Duffy, Mr.
Zubaydah’s international legal representative, highlighted how
“remarkable” it was that his drawings had ever seen the light of day
even though he hasn’t “been able to communicate directly with the
outside world” in all these endless years.</p>
<p><strong>Calls for Action</strong></p>
<p>In the years of the Biden presidency, the international community has
focused on Guantánamo in unprecedented ways. In January 2022, “after 20
years and well over 100 visits,” the International Committee of the Red
Cross (the <a
href="https://www.icrc.org/en/document/icrc-calls-transfers-eligible-guantanamo-detainees">ICRC)</a>
called for the release of as many of the remaining prisoners there as
possible and, more recently, raised alarm over the failing health and
premature aging of its 30 aging inmates.  </p>
<p>Recently, the United Nations carved out new ground as well. In April,
the U.N. Working Group on Arbitrary Detention issued <a
href="https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/documents/issues/detention-wg/opinions/session95/A-HRC-WGAD-2022-66-Advance-Edited-Version.pdf">an
opinion</a> condemning the brutality long used against Mr. Zubaydah and
called for his immediate release. That group further noted that the
continued detention of the prisoners at Guantánamo could potentially
“constitute crimes against humanity.”</p>
<p>With each passing year, ever more details about Washington’s torture
programs have come to light. Yet, even now, ferocious attempts are still
being made to keep the blindfold in place. As a result, to this day
we’re left searching, arms extended, while those who have crucial
information about this country’s nightmarish commitment to torture do
their best to avoid us, hoping that the endless passage of time will
keep them out of reach until we pursuers finally run out of energy.</p>
<p>To this day, much still remains in darkness, while Congress and
American policymakers continue to refuse to address the legacy of such
wrongdoing. But as the constant dribble of information suggests, the
story simply won’t go away until, someday, the United States officially
acknowledges what it did — what, if others were now doing it, would be
instantly denounced by the same lawmakers and policymakers. That history
of torture won’t go away, in fact, until this country apologizes for it,
declassifies as much of the Feinstein report as possible, and provides
for the rehabilitation of Abu Zubaydah and others whose physical and
psychological health was savaged by their mistreatment at American
hands.</p>
<p>It’s one thing to say, as Barack Obama <a
href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-obama-torture-sb/america-does-not-torture-obama-tells-congress-idUSTRE51O0RY20090225">told
Congress</a> a month into his presidency, that the United States “does
not torture.” It’s another to expose the misdeeds of the war on terror
and accept the costs as deterrence against it ever happening again.</p>
