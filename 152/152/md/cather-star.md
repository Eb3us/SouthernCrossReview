When the moon was high I waited,\
Pale with evening's tints it shone;\
When its gold came slow, belated,\
Still I kept my watch alone

When it sank, a golden wonder,\
From my window still I bent,\
Though the clouds hung thick with thunder\
Where our hilltop roadway went.

By the cypress tops I've counted\
Every golden star that passed;\
Weary hours they've shone and mounted,\
Each more tender than the last.

All my pillows hot with turning,\
All my weary maids asleep;\
Every star in heaven was burning\
For the tryst you did not keep.

Now the clouds have hushed their warning,\
Paleness creeps upon the sea;\
One star more, and then the morning---\
Share, oh, share that star with me!

Never fear that I shall chide thee\
For the wasted stars of night,\
So thine arms will come and hide me\
From the dawn's unwelcome light.

Though the moon a heav'n had given us,\
Every star a crown and throne,\
Till the morn apart had driven us---\
Let the last star be our own.

Ah! the cypress tops are sighing\
With the wind that brings the day;\
There my last pale treasure dying\
Ebbs in jeweled light away;

Ebbs like water bright, untasted;\
Black the cypress, bright the sea;\
Heav'n's whole treasury lies wasted\
And the dawn burns over me.
