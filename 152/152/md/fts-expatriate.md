# The Expatriate

## by Frank Thomas Smith

The problem with most foreign lands\
is that they\'re much too far away,\
like the Dodgers\' bleachers used to be\
before the debacle of technology.\
Also, either they\'re terribly bland,\
foggy, windy and damp, or,\
if southerly, downright dangerous,\
where bullets fly and sunscreen 21\
can\'t ward off the assassin sun.

Why, then, does he dwell,\
ducking and frying, far from the *patria*\
he tearfully invokes over juice of the grape\
at a sidewalk table of the corner taberna?\
Call it if you will, with a shrug, \"escape\".\
He\'ll smile and wave away a fly\
or toss aside some graying hair\
from his glabrous suntanned brow.\
\"Could be,\" he mutters, \"but who cares now?\"

Loneliness is livelier in a distant land,\
Be it ever so infuriatingly bland.\
But why does it have to be so awfully far,\
As distant lands inevitably are?\
The answer applies both near and far,\
Accessible if the door is left ajar\
To contemplate the delight brimming over\
In the smirking smile of the expat lover.

He\'ll bid goodbye to you and,\
sandal-clad as once Ulysses,\
his uncashed pension check\
snug against his bony chest,\
walk along the winding lane\
home to his dark-tressed mistress\
who waits with kisses and a wanton caress.\
Foreign lands are far away,\
it\'s true, but so is the expatriate.
