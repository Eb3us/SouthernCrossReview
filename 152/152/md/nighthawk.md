# The Nighthawk

The Nighthawk ponders how and why\
Now is today, will be yesterday,\
And was once tomorrow.

Tackle time (he says to himself)\
As a bouquet of roses, which,\
Like so many other beauties\
Will, quicker than a lie,\
Whimper, lie down and die. \
Oh, they lived for a time,\
An eternally recurring instant.

The earth is made of bytes of matter,\
Curiously crafted and joined to form\
A solid living mass on which\
We stride the day, long in light,\
On which we lay our weary heads\
When the Nighthawk nightly spreads\
His quilt upon our shivering bodies.

The Nighthawk now is more alone\
Than any visible finite star.\
He shivers despite the calefacient quilt\
And the raging fire he has built.

Warmth can come from a southern breeze:\
When the heart beats and breathes.  \
No warmth will willingly come\
From northern gales: the head\'s details.

Wander the world, quoth the Nighthawk,\
As does the tiger burning bright\
In the forests of the night,\
In the jungle\'s warming breath\
till timeless time whistles death.
