	<p class="intro">If (as the Greek affirmed in the Cratylus)<br>
	the name is archetype of the thing<br>
	in the letters of “rose” is the rose<br>
	and all the Nile in the word “Nile”.<br>
<br>
	And, made of consonants and vowels,<br>
	there'll be a terrible Name, which<br>
	guards in precise letters and syllables<br>
	the ciphered essence of God and the Omnipotence.<br>
<br>
<p>*</p>
<br>
	Adam and the stars knew it<br>
	in the garden. The corrosion of sin<br>
	(the qabalists say) has erased it,<br>
	And the generations have lost it.<br>
<br>
	The artifices and candor of man<br>
	are endless. We know there was a day<br>
	when God’s people were seeking the Name<br>
	in the solemn vigils of Jewry.<br>
<br>
	Not in the way of others where an obscure<br>
	shadow insinuates in the obscure history,<br>
	still young and alive is the memory<br>
	of Judah Loew, who was a rabbi in Prague.<br>
<br>
	Thirsting to know what God knows,<br>
	Judah Loew arranged permutations<br>
	of letters and complex variations<br>
	and finally pronounced the Name: the Key,<br>
<br>
	the Door, the Echo, the Guest and the Palace,<br>
	over a doll which with clumsy hands<br>
	he carved, to teach it the secrets<br>
	of the Letters, of Time and of Space.<br>
<br>
	The simulacrum lifted its sleepy<br>
	lids and saw forms and colors<br>
	it did not understand, and lost in sounds<br>
	it rehearsed fearful movements.<br>
<br>
	Gradually, it saw itself (as do we)<br>
	imprisoned in this sonorous web<br>
	of Before, After, Yesterday, Meanwhile, Now,<br>
	Right, Left, I, You, Those, Others.<br>
<br>
	(The qabalist who presided as numen<br>
	named the immense creature Golem;<br>
	these truths are given by Scholem,<br>
	in a learned part of his volume.)<br>
<br>
	The rabbi explained to it the universe<br>
	“This is my foot, this is yours, this the rope.”<br>
	And after years got the perverse creature<br>
	To sweep the synagogue, well or badly.<br>
<br>
	Perhaps twas an error in penmanship<br>
	or in pronouncing the Sacred Name,<br>
	for despite such avid enchantment,<br>
	the apprentice of man learned not to speak.<br>
<br>
	Its eyes, less of man than of dog,<br>
	and even less of dog than of thing,<br>
	followed the rabbi around the pallid<br>
	penumbra of the confining rooms.<br>
<br>
	Something abnormal and gross was in the Golem.<br>
	because the Rabbi’s cat at its passing<br>
	would hide. (This cat is not in Scholem,<br>
	But in the passing of time I divine it.)<br>
<br>
	Lifting filial hands to its God<br>
	it copied its own god's devotions;<br>
	or, stupid and smiling, it would bow<br>
	in concave oriental salaams.<br>
<br>
	The Rabbi observed it with tenderness<br>
	and with some horror. “How” (he asked)<br>
	“could I beget this sorry son<br>
	and abandon inaction, wherein sanity lies?”<br>
<br>
	“Why did I add to the infinite<br>
	series another symbol? Why to the vain<br>
	skein that winds in the eternal<br>
	did I give another cause, an effect, and grief?”<br>
<br>
	In the hour of anguish and lack of light,<br>
	his eyes on his Golem would rest.<br>
	Who will tell us the things God felt<br>
	when looking at his rabbi in Prague?</p>
