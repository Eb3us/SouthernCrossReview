<h3>	                Stages</h3>



	                            <p>As every flower fades and as all youth<br>

	                            Departs, so life at every stage,<br>

	                            So every virtue, so our grasp of truth,<br>

	                            Blooms in its day and may not last forever.<br>

	                            Since life may summon us at every age<br>

	                            Be ready, heart, for parting, new endeavor,<br>

	                            Be ready bravely and without remorse<br>

	                            To find new light that old ties cannot give.<br>

	                            In all beginnings dwells a magic force<br>

	                            For guarding us and helping us to live.<br>

	                            Serenely let us move to distant places<br>

	                            And let no sentiments of home detain us.<br>

	                            The Cosmic Spirit seeks not to restrain us<br>

	                            But lifts us stage by stage to wider spaces.<br>

	                            If we accept a home of our own making,<br>

	                            Familiar habit makes for indolence.<br>

	                            We must prepare for parting and leave-taking<br>

	                            Or else remain the slaves of permanence.<br>
<br>
	                            Even the hour of our death may send<br>

	                            Us speeding on to fresh and newer spaces,<br>

	                            And life may summon us to newer races.<br>

	                            So be it, heart: bid farewell without end.<br>
<br>

	                            <h3>Worship</h3>



	                            <p>In the beginning was the rule of sacred kings<br>

	                            Who hallowed field, grain, plow, who handed down<br>

	                            The law of sacrifices, set the bounds<br>

	                            To mortal men forever hungering<br>

	                            For the Invisible Ones' just ordinance<br>

	                            That holds the sun and moon in perfect balance<br>

	                            And whose forms in their eternal radiance<br>

	                            Feel no suffering, nor know death's ambience.<br>
<br>


	                            Long ago the sons of the gods, the sacred line,<br>

	                            Passed, and mankind remained alone,<br>

	                            Embroiled in pleasure and pain, cut off from being,<br>

	                            Condemned to change unhallowed, unconfined.<br>

<br>

	                            But intimations of the true life never died,<br>

	                            And it is for us, in this time of harm,<br>

	                            To keep, in metaphor and symbol and in psalm,<br>

	                            Reminders of that sacred reverence.<br>

<br>

	                            Perhaps some day the darkness will be banned,<br>

	                            Perhaps some day the times will turn about,<br>

	                            The sun will once more rule us as our god,<br>

	                            And take the sacrifices from our hand. </p>

	                            <hr>

	                            <h3>Soap Bubbles</h3>

	                            <p>From years of study and of contemplation<br>

	                            An old man brews a work of clarity,<br>

	                            A gay and convoluted dissertation<br>

	                            Discoursing on sweet wisdom playfully.<br>

<br>

	                            An eager student bent on storming heights<br>

	                            Has delved in archives and in libraries,<br>

	                            But adds the touch of genius when he writes<br>

	                            A first book full of deepest subtleties.<br>

<br>

	                            A boy, with bowl and straw, sits and blows,<br>

	                            Filling with breath the bubbles from the bowl.<br>

	                            Each praises like a hymn, and each one glows;<br>

	                            Into the filmy beads he blows his soul.<br>

<br>

	                            Old man, student, boy, all these three<br>

	                            Out of the Maya-foam of the universe<br>

	                            Create illusions. None is better or worse.<br>

	                            But in each of them the Light of Eternity<br>

	                            Sees its reflection, and burns more joyfully.</p>
