<h1>Donald at the Bat</h1>

<table style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto">
	<td>
	<p class="intro">The outlook wasn't brilliant for the Shithole nine that day:<br>
	The score stood four to two, with but one inning more to play,<br>
	And then when Sessions died at first, and Cohen did the same,<br>
	A pall-like silence fell upon the patrons of the game.</p>

	<p>A straggling few got up to go in deep despair. The rest<br>
	Clung to the hope which springs eternal in the human breast;<br>
	They thought, "If only Donald could but get a whack at that—<br>
	We'd put up even money now, with Donald at the bat."</p>

	<p>But Rudi preceded Donald, as did also Huckabee,<br>
	And the former was a hoodoo, while the latter was a cake;<br>
	So upon that stricken multitude grim melancholy sat,<br>
	For there seemed but little chance of Donald getting to the bat.</p>

	<p>But Rudi let drive a single, to the wonderment of all,<br>
	And Hucky, the much despised, tore the cover off the ball;<br>
	And when the dust had lifted, and men saw what had occurred,<br>
	There was Hucky safe at second and Rudi a-hugging third.</p>

	<p>Then from five thousand throats and more there rose a lusty yell;<br>
	It rumbled through the valley, it rattled in the dell;<br>
	It pounded on the mountain and recoiled upon the flat,<br>
	For Donald, mighty Donald, was advancing to the bat.</p>

	<p>There was ease in Donald's manner as he stepped into his place;<br>
	There was pride in Donald's bearing and a smile lit Donald's face.<br>
	And when, responding to the cheers, he lightly doffed his hat,<br>
	No stranger in the crowd could doubt 'twas Donald at the bat.</p>

	<p>Ten thousand eyes were on him as he rubbed his hands with dirt;<br>
	Five thousand tongues applauded when he wiped them on his shirt;<br>
	Then while the writhing pitcher ground the ball into his hip,<br>
	Defiance flashed in Donald's eye, a sneer curled Donald's lip.</p>

	<p>And now the leather-covered sphere came hurtling through the air,<br>
	And Donald stood a-watching it in haughty grandeur there.<br>
	Close by the sturdy batsman the ball unheeded sped—<br>
	"That ain't my style," said Donald. "Strike one!" the umpire said.</p>

	<p>From the benches, black with people, there went up a muffled roar,<br>
	Like the beating of the storm-waves on a stern and distant shore;<br>
	"Kill him! Kill the umpire!" shouted someone on the stand;<br>
	And it's likely they'd have killed him had not Donald raised his hand.</p>

	<p>With a smile of Christian charity great Donald's visage shone;<br>
	He stilled the rising tumult; he bade the game go on;<br>
	He signaled to the pitcher, and once more the dun sphere flew;<br>
	But Donald still ignored it and the umpire said, "Strike two!"</p>

	<p>"Fraud!" cried the maddened thousands, and echo answered "Fraud!"<br>
	But one scornful look from Donald and the audience was awed.<br>
	They saw his face grow stern and cold, they saw his muscles strain,<br>
	And they knew that Donald wouldn't let that ball go by again.</p>

	<p>The sneer is gone from Donald's lip, his teeth are clenched in hate,<br>
	He pounds with cruel violence his bat upon the plate;<br>
	And now the pitcher holds the ball, and now he lets it go,<br>
	And now the air is shattered by the force of Donald's blow.</p>

	<p>Oh, somewhere in this favored land the sun is shining bright,<br>
	The band is playing somewhere, and somewhere hearts are light;<br>
	And somewhere men are laughing, and somewhere children shout,<br>
	But there is no joy in Shithole—mighty Donald has struck out.</p>
