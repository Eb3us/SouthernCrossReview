<p class="intro">This article, if read at all, will likely be read by people who already
know something about Anthroposophy and others who are just curious. As
readers I am more interested in reaching them in reverse order. This
innocent group probably heard the Word from contact with a Waldorf
school or with someone who went to one or had a child who did, or
teaches in one. Or from anthroposophical medicine and real physicians
who practice it for patients who are open-minded (or intelligent) enough
to confide in them. And there is also bio-dynamic agriculture. And, of
course, there’s Rudolf Steiner’s spiritual-scientific teaching.</p>
<p>However you may have come across the Word, I think it would be
helpful if there were a place where you could get at least a general
idea of what it’s all about. If it then interests you more than just
enough, you can easily begin more detailed study. I hope to provide that
general idea here, rent free – at least my understanding of and feeling
for it.</p>
<p>There has been and still is much criticism and even ridicule of
Anthroposophy and of its founder Rudolf Steiner, especially in Germany.
And why not? We live in a materialistic age in which the opposite –
spiritual-science or Anthroposophy – is condemned by the kind of
academics and natural scientists and philosophers who are unable to
accept anything as remotely true if it is not measurable or observable
through the physical senses. The subject may be evolution or astronomy
or birth and death, good and evil or much more, such as a spiritual
world and spiritual beings behind it all.</p>
<p>Then prove it, damn you!</p>
<p>That would make it too easy, for it’s necessary to work your way
through to the actual proof—to yourself.</p>
<p>“The preliminaries leading up to the conditions under which spiritual
observation is possible have to be furnished by the soul itself and by
the total disposition of the soul”, Rudolf Steiner maintained. “This
will of course be indignantly denied; but the only real reason for
insisting on ‘external proofs’ is the fact that they can be obtained in
reasonable comfort, whereas the authentically spiritual-scientific
method is a laborious and disconcerting one.”</p>
<p>I remember a TV interview program in which the interviewer asked his
expert guest – the physicist director of the Hayden Planetarium in New
York – to explain certain complicated aspects of the starry and
planetary movements. After he had done so, the interviewer said, “And
it’s random?” “Yes, it’s all random,” the physicist replied.</p>
<p>Then prove it’s random, I mutter from my couch.</p>
<p>The existence of nature as we know it today must then also be random:
microbes and elements and such stuff bounce and join together over the
millennia until they randomly merge into trees and flowers and rivers
and chipmunks and tigers and apes and, yes, human beings, that is, human
beings’ bodies – which will also, inevitably, wither away like
everything else living. Exceptionally, however, humans, some or many,
wonder about the meaning of life, or rather wonder if life has meaning.
It’s worrisome really. The human body returns to nature in ashes, but
what about the rest of him/her? Well, if you think everything is random,
the only logical answer is <em>nada</em>. When all those nerve cells and
the brain itself revert to nature and dies, randomness takes over and
you cease to exist. Period!</p>
<p>“Wait a minute. I’m not an atheist,” you’ll say just in case someone
or something is listening. “What if when I die – yeah, I know, can’t
avoid that – it’s not <em>nada</em> and I’m still conscious …
somehow?”</p>
<p>Good for you; at least you’re thinking.</p>
<p><strong>Reincarnation and karma</strong></p>
<p>One of the basic elements of Anthroposophy is the reality of
reincarnation and karma. This is not unique to Anthroposophy, it is in
fact accepted by the various schools of Buddhism and other oriental
religions and philosophies. But it is neither accepted nor even
considered by Christian churches or western philosophy. Why not? After
all, there is no proof either of the resurrection of Christ. Ah, but the
resurrection is described in the Gospels and that is proof enough for
the priests and the faithful.</p>
<p>“But that’s not proof, it’s blind faith!!” you counter.</p>
<p>Well yeah, and it’s not Anthroposophy either. There are several ways
to consider reincarnation. One is to use your capacity for logical
thinking: Does life have meaning? Does <em>human</em> life have meaning?
More personally: Does <em>my</em> life have meaning? You don’t know? Why
in God’s name are you wasting time here? Hamlet asked himself the same
question – poetically:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>To be, or not to be, that is the question:</strong><br />
Whether ’tis nobler in the mind to suffer<br />
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,<br />
Or to take Arms against a Sea of troubles,<br />
And by opposing end them: to die, to sleep<br />
No more; and by a sleep, to say we end<br />
The heart-ache, and the thousand natural shocks<br />
That Flesh is heir to? ’Tis a consummation<br />
Devoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep,<br />
To sleep, perchance to Dream; aye, there’s the rub,<br />
For in that sleep of death, what dreams may come,<br />
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,<br />
Must give us pause. There’s the respect<br />
That makes Calamity of so long life:<br />
For who would bear the Whips and Scorns of time,<br />
The Oppressor’s wrong, the poor man’s Contumely,<br />
The pangs of dispriz’d Love, the Law’s delay,<br />
The insolence of Office, and the spurns<br />
That patient merit of th’unworthy takes,<br />
When he himself might his Quietus make With a bare Bodkin?<br />
Who would these Fardels bear,<br />
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,<br />
But that the dread of something after death,<br />
The undiscovered country, from whose bourn<br />
No traveller returns, puzzles the will,<br />
And makes us rather bear those ills we have,<br />
Than fly to others that we know not of?<br />
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,<br />
And thus the native hue of Resolution<br />
Is sicklied o’er, with the pale cast of Thought,<br />
And enterprises of great pith and moment,<br />
With this regard their Currents turn away,<br />
And lose the name of Action. Soft you now,<br />
The fair Ophelia? Nymph, in thy Orisons<br />
Be all my sins remember’d.</em></p>

<p>He decides against suicide, but at the end he dies anyway: All he had
to do was be ready for it. ‘<em>Readiness is all,’</em> he says as he
prepares for his final hour. Stabbed with a poison-tipped rapier, he
dies and utters his last words:’<em>The rest is silence.’</em></p>
<p>Horatio is left alone with the bodies all around him. He looks down
at his friend and says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>‘Now cracks a noble heart. Good night, sweet prince,  And flights
of angels sing thee to thy rest.’</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Anthroposophy flights of angels do indeed exist, and archangels,
archai and on up, good and evil ones. All in a process of development
or, if you prefer, evolution. The human being under the best of
circumstances can live from eighty to a hundred years nowadays. Some die
younger, others never even grow to maturity. How much can the long-lived
develop in such a short time, let alone the short-lived? And to what
extent can we become free of the constraints of nature? We can’t fly
like birds or swim like fish – despite our airplanes and submarines.</p>
<p>If you decide that you need concrete (material) evidence that
something exists, then you will never find the meaning of life or even
be able to determine that such a meaning exists. And if it doesn’t? Then
you may as well give up the ghost now. What’s the point of all the
suffering and worry? Really?</p>
<p>Is suffering also random? Or is there meaning in it? What about the
innocent children killed in warfare. As I write, genocidal murder is
still going on in Gaza, Israel. Is it the dead children’s end? Or will
they be reincarnated? And what about all those murdered in the
holocaust? If life has meaning it must include reincarnation and the
justice of karma, or destiny. If not, it is meaningless.</p>
<p>Casey Stengel said “It’s not over ´til it’s over”. He was talking
about a baseball game, but we can extend his wisdom to “...and even then
it’s not over” when referring to life. Just as a new game with the same
team is played another day, a new life is born of the same person – and
the game goes on.</p>
<p>There are not only good angels in Anthroposophy. There are also evil
ones. Rudolf Steiner calls the two chief ones, or types, Lucifer and
Ahriman. Both try to influence human beings negatively, but in opposite
directions. Lucifer wants you to be over-spiritual, that is, to not let
your feet touch the ground, rejecting the earthly physical world in
favor of a mystical never-never land of fairies and drug-induced
fantasy. Ahriman’s ambition is to sink humanity into materialism,
causing us to believe that matter is the <em>only</em> reality. Also,
and more importantly, he induces us to substitute machines for human
contact. I sit here typing away on my computer as I condemn Ahriman for
helping to invent it. I also buy many of the goods I used to buy from
people in stores with an internet “app”. I also pay most of my bills on
it, when I used to interchange greetings with other people in banks or
the cooperative in our village. I see none of these people anymore.
Actually, I have no real need to have contact with any living human.</p>
<p>It hasn’t gotten that far yet, but it’s on the way with “artificial
intelligence”. In the newspaper I read on the internet I have become
aware of an increasing incidence of suicides in the United States, and
elsewhere, especially among adolescents. The “experts” have so many
theories as to the reason that they betray their desperation. They blame
social media, for example.</p>
<p>How about materialism as the cause, when young people have a dire
need for a conviction that life has meaning beyond whatever level of
depression they are experiencing? In other words, a spiritual
shortcut.</p>
<p><strong>The Nature of Man</strong></p>
<p>Humans have physical bodies, as do animals and plants. They are
composed of the same elements as Nature is: solids, liquids (mostly) and
air. These elements are shaped by a formative life force, aka etheric
force. Animals and humans have more than a life-force, they also have
astral bodies, or souls, with which they are conscious and have
feelings. Human beings also possess individual selves; each human being
can only say “I” when referring to him or her self. Therefore, a human
being possesses a life-being, which he shares with the vegetable
kingdom, an astral-being, which he shares with the animal kingdom and an
individual “I”.</p>
<p>When a person dies, his physical body decomposes and returns to
nature. Nature can only disintegrate or destroy a physical body. It does
so when the etheric or life force leaves it upon death – and returns
when the individual’s spirit or I is ready to reincarnate after a
sojourn in the spiritual world. It returns carrying its karmic baggage,
so to speak, accumulated during many previous incarnations.</p>
<p><strong>Christianity</strong></p>
<p>An essential element of Anthroposophy is Christianity. Not the
organized churchly kind, where everything seemingly illogical is
explained away as a “mystery”. Ah yes, God’s work is indeed mysterious,
but not in the way the churches mean. Rudolf Steiner wrote a book
entitled “Christianity as Mystical fact”. If you’re interested in
Christianity, it’s a must read. In it he explains that the Gospels were
written as mystery documents, that is, by initiates in the ancient
mystery cults. Only other initiates were allowed to read them and only
they could truly understand them. Therefore, the Gospels are literally
true, but they were not meant to be easily understood by the
uninitiated. For example, Mary the mother of Jesus is claimed to have
been a virgin. The meaning is that she had a pure soul. It does not mean
that there was no sexual relationship with Joseph. After all, Jesus had
brothers – and perhaps sisters as well.</p>
<p>The Gospel of John begins, according to the accepted translation: “In
the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was
God.” You don’t have to be an initiate to realize that this is a
contradiction, even an impossibility. How can the Word [logos] be with
God and be God at the same time? In the original ancient Greek, there is
no grammatical difference between “...was God.” and “...was a God.”
Common sense tells us that the correct translation must be “and the Word
was <strong>a</strong> god. Or a divinity or a divine being. There are
many such apparent Biblical contradictions and impossibilities also
clarified in Anthroposophy.</p>
<p>Did you know that there were two Jesus children? Actually there were.
If you were to take the time to compare the Luke Gospel with the Matthew
Gospel, you would note that the birth stories are completely different.
First of all, Jesus’s genealogy (A was the son of Y, who was the son of
X, etc.) is completely different from David to Joseph in the Matthew and
Luke Gospels. There was no room in the inn for the Luke Jesus, so he was
born in a stable and the shepherds came to adore him. Hardly the setting
for the future king of the Jews. Why? Because the future king of the
Jews was not born in a stable, but he was sought and found by the Magi,
who adored him and gave him precious gifts worthy of a king. But he was
so feared by King Herod that he and his parents had to flee to Egypt in
order to avoid being massacred along with the rest of the “holy
innocents” under the age of two. Once Herod had died, they were able to
return to Nazareth. This is related in the Gospel of Matthew, but not
mentioned nor even hinted at in the Gospel of Luke.</p>
<p>There is much more to all those paragraph headings. But please be
kind and remember that this is a mere introduction.</p>
<p><strong>The Triformation of the Social Organism</strong></p>
<p>This will take more space to describe, even cryptically, all the
above – by me at least. So it will be dealt with separately – as Part
Two – in case you are interested. When? To be announced.</p>
