<h1>Midnight Christmas</h1>

<h2>by Frank Thomas Smith</h2>
<p>The midnight air was a crystal vise<br />
Crushing a billion bits of ice â€“<br />
One stood out grand and glaring.<br />
Mary, a virgin in her bearing,</p>
<p>Joseph trying to make the best<br />
Of expectations. You know the rest:<br />
Denied the use of house and table,<br />
The birth took place in a humble stable.</p>
<p>Shepherds, black and yellow kings,<br />
The sky a feast of angels' wings.<br />
Thirty years later came the dove,<br />
Ushering in the age of love.</p>
<h3>The Return of the Magi</h3>

<p>This town is one we've seen before:<br />
These crooked lanes, that stable door,<br />
Although it must have been a dream,<br />
For never were we here before.</p>
<p>And that quick dog, scared and lean,<br />
Crossing the square scarcely seen<br />
And the dark-haired girl leaning out<br />
The hostel window familiar seem.</p>
<p>The sky was lit by the evening star<br />
As now, but brighter then by far;<br />
Above us shuddered angels' wings<br />
And we had journeyed far, so far.</p>
