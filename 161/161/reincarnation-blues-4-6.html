<h3>Reincarnation Blues – Canto IV</h3>
      <img class="a" src="reincarnation-blues-1.jpg"/>
      <h2>by Frank Thomas Smith</h2>

</header>

<main style="display:flex;flex-direction:column;align-items:center">
<div>

<p class="intropoem">Meditating on the mother of questions,<br />
(I don't mean the coronavirus<br />
Or the First Class Esoteric Lessons)<br />
But the one that necessarily concerns us:</p>


<p>Sooner or later you'll want to know<br />
If life has meaning and if so: what?<br />
We can start be presuming the answer is: no!<br />
If that's the case are we alive or: not?</p>


<p>Or are we actors in a computer game<br />
As the movie Matrix wonkly warned?<br />
Like death itself it's all the same:<br />
No one emerges wholly unharmed.</p>


<p>But if life – human life I mean –<br />
Is real, then so are you and I<br />
Not to mention nature's green<br />
Life of leaves that will also die.</p>


<p>Don't bother going to church<br />
To confess your tawdry trespasses;<br />
It'll surely leave you in the lurch<br />
Cause God doesn't give freepasses.</p>


<p>The killing going on with so much terror<br />
Could make you resort to Brother Booze<br />
But that would be a fateful error<br />
Intones the Reincarnation Blues.</p>
</div>

<h3>Reincarnation Blues – Canto V</h3>
      <div>
<p class="intropoem">We'll meet again some day somewhere<br />
The songsters sing, the lovers cry,<br />
As though they knew or even cared,<br />
Forgetting that we all must die,</p>


<p>Some day, somehow, somewhere, some place.<br />
Little do they know it's true<br />
That we all must meet somewhere in space<br />
Although in bodies ever new.</p>


<p>To believe in God is a pretty good start.<br />
To reject him though is also done<br />
By putting the donkey before the cart:<br />
It's not His fault the bad guys won.</p>


<p>You wonder why she died so young<br />
So good, so beautiful, so loved by you,<br />
A love alas not lasting long,<br />
Laced with pain biting through.</p>


<p>I Know, I know, it doesn't seem fair<br />
Perhaps it isn't, but who are we<br />
To Judge? Who are we to care?<br />
Time is long or short, you see.</p>


<p>It's time to stop and dry your tears,<br />
There's nothing more to win or lose,<br />
At least not now as the ending nears:<br />
So rules the Reincarnation Blues.</p>
</div>
<h3>Reincarnation Blues – Canto VI</h3>
      <div>

<p class="intropoem">You want to live to a ripe old age,<br />
But rather not by growing old.<br />
Can't be done so tether your rage,<br />
Relax, be smart, come in from the cold.</p>


<p>Join the toothless-talking droll,<br />
Balding braggarts who roll the dice<br />
And hesitate to sell their soul<br />
(To you-know-whom) at any price.</p>


<p>Something I almost forgot (on purpose):<br />
Not made and sold by Big Pharma,<br />
Likely as lively as a three-ring circus:<br />
Yours and yours alone: it's karma!</p>


<p>Nothing is forgotten, my friend,<br />
Nothing forgiven without repentance;<br />
No matter how hard you try to bend it<br />
There's no confounding karma's ascension.</p>


<p>Reincarnation Blues has a drumbeat ,<br />
A rhythm that keeps your blood awake.<br />
To challenge it results in a drab defeat,<br />
A sudden sodden chilly checkmate.</p>


        <p>Whether you're black or white or in-between,<br/>
          Your attack is obvious or by a queenly gambit,<br/>
          It depends on how by the gods you're seen<br/>
          To have loved – truly or merely faking it.</p>
