La Orana Maria by Paul Guaguin

Paul Guaguin: (7 June 1848 -- 8 May 1903) was a French painter,
sculptor, ceramist and writer, whose work has been primarily associated
with the post-impressionist and symbolist movements. While only
moderately successful during his lifetime, Gauguin has since been
recognized for his experimental use of color.

By the 1890s, Gauguin\'s art took a significant turn during his time in
Tahiti, then a French colony. During that time, he controversially
married three adolescent Tahitian girls with whom he later fathered
children. His paintings from that period, characterized by vivid colors
and Symbolist themes, would prove highly successful among the European
viewers for their exploration of the relationships between people,
nature, and the spiritual world. Gauguin\'s art became popular after his
death. His work was influential on the French avant-garde and many
modern artists, such as Pabli Picasso and Henri Matisse, and he is well
known for his relationship with Vincent and Theo[ van
Gogh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theo_van_Gogh_(art_dealer)).
