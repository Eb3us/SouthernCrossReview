# Midnight Christmas

## by Frank Thomas Smith

The midnight air was a crystal vise\
Crushing a billion bits of ice --\
One stood out grand and glaring.\
Mary, a virgin in her bearing,

Joseph trying to make the best\
Of expectations. You know the rest:\
Denied the use of house and table,\
The birth took place in a humble stable.

Shepherds, black and yellow kings,\
The sky a feast of angels\' wings.\
Thirty years later came the dove,\
Ushering in the age of love.

### The Return of the Magi

This town is one we\'ve seen before:\
These crooked lanes, that stable door,\
Although it must have been a dream,\
For never were we here before.

And that quick dog, scared and lean,\
Crossing the square scarcely seen\
And the dark-haired girl leaning out\
The hostel window familiar seem.

The sky was lit by the evening star\
As now, but brighter then by far;\
Above us shuddered angels\' wings\
And we had journeyed far, so far.
