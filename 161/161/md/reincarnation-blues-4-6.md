# Reincatarnation Blues -- Canto IV to VI 
### Reincarnation Blues -- Canto IV

> Meditating on the mother of questions,\
> (I don\'t mean the coronavirus\
> Or the First Class Esoteric Lessons)\
> But the one that necessarily concerns us:

> Sooner or later you\'ll want to know\
> If life has meaning and if so: what?\
> We can start be presuming the answer is: no!\
> If that\'s the case are we alive or: not?

> Or are we actors in a computer game\
> As the movie Matrix wonkly warned?\
> Like death itself it\'s all the same:\
> No one emerges wholly unharmed.

> But if life -- human life I mean --\
> Is real, then so are you and I\
> Not to mention nature\'s green\
> Life of leaves that will also die.

> Don\'t bother going to church\
> To confess your tawdry trespasses;\
> It\'ll surely leave you in the lurch\
> Cause God doesn\'t give freepasses.

> The killing going on with so much terror\
> Could make you resort to Brother Booze\
> But that would be a fateful error\
> Intones the Reincarnation Blues.

Reincarnation Blues -- Canto V

> We\'ll meet again some day somewhere\
> The songsters sing, the lovers cry,\
> As though they knew or even cared,\
> Forgetting that we all must die,

> Some day, somehow, somewhere, some place.\
> Little do they know it\'s true\
> That we all must meet somewhere in space\
> Although in bodies ever new.

> To believe in God is a pretty good start.\
> To reject him though is also done\
> By putting the donkey before the cart:\
> It\'s not His fault the bad guys won.

> You wonder why she died so young\
> So good, so beautiful, so loved by you,\
> A love alas not lasting long,\
> Laced with pain biting through.

> I Know, I know, it doesn\'t seem fair\
> Perhaps it isn\'t, but who are we\
> To Judge? Who are we to care?\
> Time is long or short, you see.

> It\'s time to stop and dry your tears,\
> There\'s nothing more to win or lose,\
> At least not now as the ending nears:\
> So rules the Reincarnation Blues.

Reincarnation Blues -- Canto VI

> You want to live to a ripe old age,\
> But rather not by growing old.\
> Can\'t be done so tether your rage,\
> Relax, be smart, come in from the cold.

> Join the toothless-talking droll,\
> Balding braggarts who roll the dice\
> And hesitate to sell their soul\
> (To you-know-whom) at any price.

> Something I almost forgot (on purpose):\
> Not made and sold by Big Pharma,\
> Likely as lively as a three-ring circus:\
> Yours and yours alone: it\'s karma!

> Nothing is forgotten, my friend,\
> Nothing forgiven without repentance;\
> No matter how hard you try to bend it\
> There\'s no confounding karma\'s ascension.

> Reincarnation Blues has a drumbeat ,\
> A rhythm that keeps your blood awake.\
> To challenge it results in a drab defeat,\
> A sudden sodden chilly checkmate.

> Whether you\'re black or white or in-between,\  
> Your attack is obvious or by a queenly gambit,\  
> It depends on how by the gods you\'re seen\  
> To have loved -- truly or merely faking it.
