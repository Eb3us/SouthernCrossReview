<br />
<p class="intro">When you consider what has been said here during the past two days
you will see that what belongs to the essence of imperialism is that in
an imperialistic community something that was felt to be part of a
mission – not necessarily justified, but understandable – later
continued on as an automatism, so to speak. In the history of human
development things are retained – simply due to indolence – which were
once justified or explicable, but no longer are.</p>
<p>If a community is obliged to defend itself for a period of time, then
it is surely justified to create certain professions for that purpose:
police and military professions. But when the danger against which
defense was necessary no longer exists, the professions continue to
exist. The people involved must remain. They want to continue to
exercise their professions and therefore we have something which is no
longer justified by the circumstances. Something develops which,
although perhaps originating due to the necessity for defense, takes on
an aggressive character. It is so with all empires, except the original
imperialism of the first human societies, of which I spoke yesterday, in
which the people’s mentality considered the ruler to be a god and thus
justified in expanding his domain as far as possible. This justification
was no longer there in all the subsequent empires.</p>
<p>Let us now consider once again from definite viewpoints what is
apparent in the historical evolution of mankind. We find that in the
oldest times the will of the individual who was seen as divine was the
indisputable power factor. In public life there was in reality nothing
to discuss in such empires; but this impossibility of discussion was
grounded in the fact that a god in human form walked the earth as the
ruler. That was, if I may say so, a secure foundation for public
affairs.</p>
<p>Gradually all that which was based on divine will and was thus secure
passed over to the second stage. In that stage the things which can be
observed in physical life, be they persons, be they the persons’
insignias, be they the deeds of the governing or ruling persons, it was
all symbols, signs. Whereas during the first phase of imperialism here
in the physical world the spirit was considered directly present, during
the second stage everything physical was thought of as a reflection, as
an image, as a symbol for what is not actually present in the physical
world, but only illustrated by the persons and deeds in the physical
world.</p>
<p>Such times, when the second stage appeared, was when it first
occurred to people that a possibility for discussion of public affairs
was possible. What we today call rights can hardly be considered as
existing during the first stage. And the only political institution
worth mentioning was the phenomenon of divine power exercised by
physical people. In social affairs the only thing that mattered was the
concrete will of a physical person. To try to judge whether this will
was justified or not makes no sense. It was just there. It had to be
obeyed. To discuss whether the god in human form should or should not do
this or that made no sense. In fact it was not done during those times
when the conditions I have described really existed. But if one only saw
an image of the spiritual world in physical institutions, if one spoke
of what Saint Augustine called the “City of God” - that is, the state
which exists here on earth, but which is really an image of heavenly
facts and personalities, then one can hold the opinion that what the
person does who is a divine image is right, is a true image: someone
else could object and say that it is not a true image. That’s when the
possibility of discussion originated. The person of today, because he is
accustomed to criticize everything, to discuss everything, thinks that
to criticize and discuss was always present in human history. That is
not true. Discussing and criticizing are attributes of the second stage,
which I have described for you. Thus began the possibility to judge on
one’s own, that is, to add a predicate to a subject. In the oldest forms
of human expression this personal judging was not at all present in
respect to public affairs. During the second stage what we call today
parliament for example was in preparation; for a parliament only makes
sense when it is possible to discuss public affairs. Therefore, even the
most primitive form of public discourse was a characteristic of the
second stage.</p>
<p>Today we live in the third stage, insofar as the characteristic form
of the western countries more or less spreads over the world. This is
the stage of platitudes. This stage of platitudes, as I characterized it
to you yesterday, is the one in which the inner substance has also
disappeared from discussion and therefore everyone can be right, or at
least think that they are right, when it can’t be proved that they are
wrong, because basically within the world of platitudes everything can
be affirmed. Nevertheless, previous stages are always retained within
the next stages. Therefore the inner impulse to imperialism exists.
People observe things very superficially. When the previous German
kaiser wrote in a book that was opened out to write in: “The king’s will
is sublime law” – what did it mean? It meant that he expressed himself
in the age of platitudes in a manner that only had meaning for the first
stage. In the first stage it was really the case that the ruler’s will
was highest law. The concept of rights, which includes the right of free
speech, and involves lawyers and courts, is essentially a characteristic
of the second stage, and can only be grasped in its reality from the
viewpoint of the second stage. Whoever has followed how much discussion
has taken place about the origin and character of rights will have
noticed that there is something shimmering in the rights concept as
such, because it is applicable to the symbolic stage, where the
spiritual shimmers through the material, shines, so that when only the
external signs, the legal aspects and words appear, one can argue and
discuss what are rights and the legal system in public discourse.</p>
<p>In the age of the platitudes, however, understanding of what is
necessary for rights in society is completely lost: that the spiritual
kingdom shines through into the physical kingdom. And then one arrives
at such definitions as I described yesterday using the example of
Woodrow Wilson. I will now read to you a definition of the law that
Woodrow Wilson gave so you can see how this definition consists of
nothing but platitudes. He said: “The law is the will of the state in
respect to those citizens who are bound by it.” So the state unfolds a
will! One can well imagine that someone who is embedded so strongly in
abstract idealism, not to mention materialism – for they are practically
the same – can claim that the state is supposed to have a will. He would
have to have lost all sense of reality to even conceive of such a thing
let alone write it down. But it is in the book I spoke to you about
yesterday – the codex of platitudes: <em>The State, Elements of
Historical and Practical Politics.</em></p>
<p>There are other interesting things in it. Only in parenthesis I would
like to draw your attention to what Wilson says in this book about the
German Empire after he describes how the efforts to found it were
finally successful in 1870/71. He describes this with the following
sentences: “The final incentive for achievement of complete national
unity was brought about by the German-French war of 1870/71. Prussia’s
brilliant success in this struggle, fought in the interest of German
patriotism against French impertinence, caused the cool restraint of the
central states towards their powerful neighbor in the north to end; they
united with the rest of Germany and the German Empire was founded in the
royal palace at Versailles on January 18, 1871.“ The same man wrote that
who a short time later in Versailles united with those whose
impertinence had once been the motivation for the founding of the German
Empire. Much of present day public opinion derives from the fact that
people are so terribly superficial and pay no attention to the facts. If
you decide to decide according to objective information, then things
look quite different from what is propounded in public and accepted by
thousands upon thousands of people. It wouldn’t have hurt one bit if
when Woodrow Wilson arrived in Paris in glory, praised from all sides,
if these remarks had been held up to him. That is what must be striven
for, to take the facts into account, which means also the truth.</p>
<p>So the second stage is when discussion arises, which is what makes
the civil rights concept possible. The third stage is when economic life
is the essential reality. And yesterday we showed how this [present] age
of platitudes is absolutely necessary in the course of historical
evolution in order that the platitude, which is empty, can open people’s
eyes to the fact that the only reality is economic life and how it is
therefore so necessary to propagate spirituality, the new spirituality
in the world.</p>
<p>People have quite a skimpy idea about this new spiritual life. And it
is therefore understandable that it is burdened with the most ridiculous
misunderstandings. For this new spirituality must penetrate into the
depths of human life. And although those secret societies, about which I
spoke yesterday, only traditionally preserve the old forms, the slogan
“brothers”, meaning not to let social class or an individual’s religion
play a part in the lodges, in a certain sense does prepare for it in the
right way.</p>
<p>We say today – I beg you to pay special attention to this, let’s take
something quite banal, quite common: “The tree is green”. This is a
manner of speaking which is common to the second stage of human
development. Perhaps you will understand me better if you imagine that
we try to paint this opinion – that “the tree is green”. You cannot
paint it! There will be some white surface and green will be added, but
nothing about the tree has been painted. And when something of the tree
is painted which isn’t green all you do is disturb the effect even more.
If you try to paint “The tree is green”, you are painting something
dead. The way we combine subject and predicate in our speech is only
useful for our view of the dead, of the non-living in the world. As we
still have no idea of how everything in the world is alive, and how to
express ourselves about what is alive, we form such judgments as “The
tree is green”, which presupposes that a relationship exists between
something and the color green, whereas the color green is itself the
creative element, the force which acts and lives. The transformation of
human thinking and feeling will have to take place within the innermost
life of the soul. This will take a long time to accomplish, but when it
does it will affect social conditions and how people relate to each
other.</p>
<p>Today we are only at the beginning of all this. But it is necessary
to know which paths lead to the light. I have said that it is meaningful
when people get together and each one’s subjective beliefs play no role.
And consider it from this viewpoint – really think about it – the way in
which anthroposophy is described. It is not described through
definitions or ordinary judgments. We try to create images, to present
things from the most varied sides, and it is senseless to try and nail
down something meant in a spiritual-scientific sense with a mere yes or
no opinion. People today always want to do that, but it isn’t
possible.</p>
<p>In happens ever more frequently – because we are growing out of the
second stage and into the third – that someone asks: What is good for me
in order to counter this or that difficulty in life? Advice is given.
Aha! The person concerned says, so in this or that situation in life one
must do this or that. They generalize. But it has only a limited
meaning, for judgments given from the spiritual world always only have
only an individual meaning, are only applicable to one case. This way of
generalizing, which we have become accustomed to in the second stage,
must not continue into the third stage. People today are very much
inclined to carry things over from the past into the future. One can
become disinclined towards the things which are pernicious for the soul
by seeing clearly what is happening.</p>
<p>Yesterday I indicated to you that in many respects the Catholic
Church harks back to the first stage. It contains something like a sham
or a shadow of the first stage of human evolution, which sometimes
solidifies into a kind of spiritual imperialism, as for example in the
11th century when the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluny_Abbey">Monks of Cluny</a>
ruled over Europe more than than is thought. From their ranks the
powerful, imperialistic Pope Gregory VII emerged. Therefore Roman
Catholic dogma enables the priest to feel greater than Christ, because
he can force him to be present at the altar. This clearly shows that the
institution of the Catholic Church is a relic, a shadow-image of what
existed in the very first imperialism.</p>
<p>You know that a great enmity existed between the Catholic Church and
the secret societies which used Freemasonry in the west – a certain form
of Freemasonry at least – as their instrument. It would go too far in
this lecture to describe in detail how this enmity has gradually
increased over time. But one thing can be said, how in these secret
societies the opinion is very strong that the Catholic Church is a relic
of the first stage of imperialism. The Holy Roman Empire used this
framework to have Charlemagne and the Ottos crowned by the pope, thereby
using the imperialism of the soul as the means of mundane anointment.
They took what still remained from older times and poured it into the
new. Thus the imperialism of the second stage was poured into the
framework of the first imperialism.</p>
<p>Now we have arrived at the third stage, which shows itself to be
economic imperialism, especially in the west. This economic imperialism
is connected to a background culture of secret societies, which are
sated with empty symbols. But while it has become clear that the social
constitution of the Church is a shadow-image of what once existed and no
longer has meaning, it is still not understood that in the second stage
the statesmen of the west still suffer under a great illusion. Woodrow
Wilson would no longer speak of the will of the Church, but he speaks of
the will of the State as being self-evident.</p>
<p>But the state only had the importance attributed to it during the
second stage of human development. Whereas during the oldest, the first
stage the Church was all-powerful, in the second stage the state
contains everything that was attributed to the Church in the first
stage. Thus the economic imperialism of Great Britain and even a certain
idea of freedom has been poured into the state. And those who were
educated in Great Britain see in the state something that can well have
a will of its own.</p>
<p>But we must perceive that this concept of the state must take the
same road the concept of the Church has traveled. It must be realized:
If we retain this concept of the state for the entire social organism, a
mere rights institution, and force everything else into this rights
institution, we are propagating a shadow just as the Church has
propagated a shadow – recognized as such by the secret societies. There
is little awareness of this though. Think of all the public affairs that
people are enthusiastic about which are pressed into the concept of the
political state. There are nationalists, chauvinists and so forth;
everything we call nation, national , chauvinism, it’s all incorporated
into the framework of the state. Nationalism is added and the concept of
the “nation-state” is construed. Or we may have a certain opinion about,
say socialism, even radical socialism: the framework of the state is
used. Instead of nationalism, socialism is incorporated. But then we
have no concept; it can only be a shadow-image, as the constitution of
the Church has become.</p>
<p>In some Protestant circles the idea has arisen that the Church is
only the visible institution, that the essence of religion must take
root in people’s hearts. But this degree of human development has not
yet arrived in respect to the political state, otherwise we wouldn’t be
trying to squeeze all kinds of nationalisms into the political
boundaries which exist as the result of the war [First World War –
trans.] All this neglects to take one thing into consideration – the
fact that what occurs in the historical development of humanity is life
and not mechanism. And a characteristic of life is that it comes and
goes. The imperialistic approach is different however. According to this
approach one does not think about the future. This is part of the
present-day approach to public affairs, that people have no living
thoughts, only dead ones. They think: Today we instituted something, it
is good, therefore it must remain forever. The feminist movement thinks
like this, as do the socialists and the nationalists. We have founded
something, it begins with us, everything waited for us until we became
clever enough. And now we have discovered the cleverest that exists and
it will continue to exist forever. It’s as though I have brought up a
child until he is eighteen years old and I say: I have brought him up
correctly, and he will stay as he is. But he will get older, and he will
also die, as does everything in the course of human evolution.</p>
<p>Now I come to what I mention before about what must accompany the
principle of indifference to one’s religious beliefs and fraternity.
What must accompany them is the awareness that life on earth includes
death and that we are aware that the institutions we create must of
necessity also cease to exist, because the death principle already
resides in them and they therefore have no wish to exist forever, do not
consider being permanent.</p>
<p>Of course under the influence of the thinking characteristic of the
second stage this is not possible . But if the feeling of shame of which
I spoke yesterday arises, when we realize that we are living in the
kingdom of platitudes under which only economic imperialism glimmers –
then will we call for the spirit, invisible but real. We will call for a
knowledge of the spirit, one which speaks of an invisible kingdom, a
kingdom which is not of this world in which the Christ-impulse can
actually gain a foothold.</p>
<p>This can only happen when the social order is tripartite, threefold:
The economy is auto-administered, the political state is no longer the
absolute, all-inclusive entity, but is exclusively concerned with with
rights alone, and spiritual/cultural life is truly free, meaning that
here in reality a free spiritual sector can be organized. The spiritual
life of humanity can only be free if it is dependent only upon itself
and when all the institutions responsible for cultivating the spirit,
that is, cultural life, are dependent only upon themselves.</p>
<p>What do we have then, when we have this tripartite organism, this
social organism? We have an economy in which the living physical earth
is predominant. In this sector the economic forces of the economy itself
are active. I doubt anyone will think that if the economy is organized
as described in my book <a
href="https://southerncrossreview.org/Ebooks/ebbasicissues2.htm">Towards
Social Renewal – Basic Issues of the Social Question</a> some kind of
super-sensible forces will be present. When we eat, when we prepare out
food, when we make our clothing, it is all reality. Esthetics may be
symbolically present, but the actual clothing is the reality.</p>
<p>When we look at the second sector of the future social organism [the
rights sector], we don’t a symbolism like the second stage, where the
political state constituted the totality, but we have what is valid for
one person being equally valid for the other.</p>
<p>And the third sector will be neither symbol nor platitude, but a
spiritual/cultural reality. The spirit will possess the possibility of
really living within humanity.</p>
<p>The inner social order can only be built through a transition to
inner truthfulness. In the age of platitudes this will be especially
difficult though. For during the age of platitudes people acquire a
certain ingenious cleverness, which is, however, nothing more than a
play on words of the old concepts. Just consider for a moment a
characteristic example. Suddenly from the imperialism of platitudes
comes the idea that it would be good if the queen of England also has
the title “Empress of India”. One can invent the most beautiful reasons
for this, but if it didn’t happen, nothing would have changed. The
Emperor of Austria, who now belongs to the deposed royalty, before he
was chased out carried around along with his other titles a most unusual
one: Franz Joseph I, Emperor of Austria, Apostolic King of Hungary, King
of Bohemia, Dalmatia, Croatia, Slovenia, Galizia, Lodomeria, Illyia and
so on. Among all these titles was also “King of Jerusalem”! The Austrian
Emperor also carried, until he was no longer emperor, the title “King of
Jerusalem”. It came from the crusades. It would be impossible to give a
better example of meaninglessness than this. And such meaninglessness
plays a much greater role than you imagine. It a question of whether we
can arise to a recognition of the present-day platitudes. It is made
difficult because those who live in platitudes are the verbal
representatives of the old concepts that stagger around in their brains
imitating thoughts. But one can only achieve real thinking again when
the inner soul-life is filled with substance and that can only come from
knowledge of the spiritual world, of spiritual life. Only by being
relieved by the spirit can one become a complete person, after having
been constipated with platitudes.</p>
<p>What I described yesterday as a feeling of shame will result in the
call for the spirit. And the propagation of the spirit will only be
possible if the spiritual/cultural sector is allowed to develop
independently. Otherwise we will always have to take advantage of
loopholes, as was the case with the Waldorf School because the
Württemberg Province education law had such a loophole which made it
possible to establish a Waldorf school only according spiritual laws,
according to spiritual principles, something which in practically no
only place on earth would be possible. But one can only organize the
things concerning the spiritual life from the spirit itself if the other
two sectors do not interfere, if everything is taken directly from the
spiritual sector itself.</p>
<p>At present the tendency is the reverse. But this tendency does not
reckon with the fact that with every new generation a new
spiritual/cultural life appears on earth. It’s immaterial whether a
dictatorship or a republic is established, if it is not understood that
everything which appears is subject to life and must be continuously
transformed, must pass through death and be formed anew, pass through
metamorphoses, then all that will be accomplished is that every new
generation will be revolutionary. Because only what is considered good
for the present will be established. A fundamental concept for the
western areas which are so mired in platitudes must be to see the social
organism as something living. And one sees it as living only when it is
considered in its threefold nature. It is just those whose favorable
economic position allows them to spread an [economic] imperialism over
practically the whole world who have the terrible responsibility of
recognizing that the cultivation of a true spiritual life must be poured
into this imperialism. It is ironic that an economic empire which spread
over the whole world was founded on the British Isles and then when they
were seeking mystical spirituality turned to those whom they had
economically conquered and exploited. [India – Tr.] The obligation
exists to allow one’s own spiritual substance to flow into the social
organism.</p>
<p>That is the awareness which our British friends should take with
them, that now, in this worldwide important historic moment, in all the
world’s economic institutions where English is spoken, the
responsibility exists to introduce true spirituality into the exterior
economic empire. It’s an either/or situation: Either efforts remain
exclusively oriented towards the economy – in which case the fall of
earthly civilization is the inevitable result – or spirit will be poured
into this economic empire, in which case what was intended for earthly
evolution will be achieved. I would like to say: Every morning we should
bear this in mind very seriously and all activities should be organized
according to this impulse. The bell tolls with extreme urgency at
present – with terrible urgency. In a certain sense we have reached the
climax of platitudes. In an age when all content has been squeezed out
of platitudes, content which came to humanity previously but which no
longer has any meaning, we must absorb real substantial content into our
psychological and social life. We must be clear about the fact that this
either/or must be decided by each individual for him or her self and
that each must participate in this decision with his most inner force of
soul. Otherwise he does not participate in the affairs of humanity.</p>
<p>But the attraction for illusion is especially strong in the age of
platitudes. We wish so to sweep away the seriousness of life. We avoid
looking at the truth inherent in our evolution. How could people let
themselves be deceived by Wilsonian ideas if they really had the intense
desire for truthful clarity? It must come. The desire for truth must
grow in humanity. Above all, the desire for the liberation of
spiritual/cultural life must grow along with the knowledge that nobody
has the right to call himself a Christian who has not grasped the
saying: “My kingdom is not of this world.”</p>
<p>This means that the kingdom of Christ must become an invisible
kingdom, a truly invisible empire, an empire of which one speaks as of
invisible things. Only when spiritual science gains in importance will
people speak of this empire. Not some church, not some state, not some
economic empire can create this empire. Only the will of the individual
who lives in a liberated spiritual/cultural life can create this
empire.</p>
<p>It is difficult to believe that in the lands in which people are
downtrodden much can be done to free spiritual life. Therefore it must
be done in those lands where the people are not downtrodden politically,
economically and, obviously, not spiritually downtrodden. Above all it
must be realized that we have not arrived at the day when we say: Until
now things have gone downhill, they will go uphill again! No, if people
do not act for this objective out of the spirit, things will not go
uphill again, but will continue downhill. Humanity does not live today
from what it has produced – for to produce again a spiritual impulse is
necessary – humanity lives today from reserves, from old reserves, and
they are being used up. And it is childish and naïve to think that a low
point is reached some day and things will get better then, even with our
hands in our laps. That’s not how it is. And I would like to see that
the words spoken here kindle a fire in the hearts of those who belong to
the anthroposophical movement. I would hope that the specter which
perhaps haunts those who find their way to this anthroposophical
movement be overcome by the spirit meant here. It is certainly true that
someone who finds his way to such a movement often seeks something for
himself, for his soul. Of course he can have that, but only in order to
stand with his soul in the service of the whole. He should advance,
certainly, for himself, but only so mankind can advance through him. I
cannot say that often enough. It should be added to those things I said
should be thought about every morning.</p>
<p>If we had really taken the inner impulse of this movement seriously,
we would have been much farther along. But perhaps what is done in our
circles does not help advance towards the future, but is often a
hindrance. We should ask ourselves why this is so. It is very important.
And above all we should not think that the sharpest powers of opposition
are not active from all sides against what strives for the well-being of
humanity.</p>
<p>I have already indicated to you what is being done in the world in
opposition to our movement, what hostility is activated against us. I
feel myself obliged to make these things known to you, so that you
should never say to yourself: We have already refuted this or that. We
have refuted nothing, because these opponents are not interested in the
truth. They prefer to ignore as much as possible the facts and simply
aim slanderous accusations from all corners.</p>
<p>I would like to read part of a letter to you which arrived recently
from Oslo. “One of our anthroposophical friends works in a so-called
people’s college in Oslo together with a certain Shirmer. This Mr
Shirmer is in a certain sense quite a proficient teacher, but is also a
fanatical racist and a sworn anti-Semite. At a people’s meeting where
three of us gave lectures about the Threefold Society, he talked against
us, or rather against Dr. Steiner’s <a
href="https://southerncrossreview.org/Ebooks/ebbasicissues2.htm">Towards
Social Renewal</a>, although without much success. The guy has a certain
influence in teachers’ circles and he works in his own way in the sense
of the social triformation in the school insofar as he is for freedom,
but on the other hand he works against the social triformation and Dr
Steiner for the simple reason that he suspects that Dr Steiner is a Jew.
That is perhaps not so bad. We must expect and overcome more serious
opposition. But now he has received confirmation of his suspicion. He
turned to an “authority”, namely the editor of the political
anthropological monthly, Berlin-Steglitz. This purely anti-Semitic
magazine wrote to him that Dr. Steiner is a Jew through and through. He
is associated with the Zionists. And the editor added that they, the
anti-Semites, have had their eye on you [Dr Steiner] for a long time. Mr
Schirmer also says that a persecution of the Jews is beginning now in
Germany, and that all the Jews on the anti-Semites’ blacklist should be
simply shot down or, as they say, rendered harmless.” and so on.</p>
<p>You see, this has nothing to do with antisemitism as such, that’s
only on the face of it. They choose slogans in these situations, with
which they try to accomplish as much as possible with people who listen
to slogans. But such things clearly indicate what most people don’t want
to see, what they want to ignore more and more. It is today much more
serious that you think, and we should not ignore the seriousness of the
times, but should realize that we are only at the beginning of these
things which are opposed to everything that is intended to advance human
progress. And that we should never, without neglecting our
responsibilities, divert our attention from what is a radical evil
within humanity, what manifests as a radical evil within humanity. The
worst that can happen today is paying attention to mere slogans and
platitudes, and believing that outdated concepts somehow have roots in
human reality today – if we do not initiate a new reality from the
sources of the spirit itself.</p>
<p>That, my dear friends, was what I wanted to tell you today, first of
all to all of you, but especially to those whose visit has pleased us
greatly – especially to our English friends, so that when they return to
their own country, where it will be so important, they will have
something on which to base their activities. You will have seen that I
have not spoken in favor or against anyone, nor have I flattered anyone.
I only speak here in order to say the truth. I have known theosophists
who when they speak to members of a foreign nation begin to talk about
what an honor it is to be able to spread the teachings about the
spiritual life in a nation which has accumulated so much glory. Such
things cannot be said to you here. But I believe that you have come here
to hear the truth and I think that I have best served you by really
trying to tell the unvarnished truth. You will have learned during your
trip that telling the truth nowadays is not a comfortable thing, for the
truth calls forth opposition now more than ever. Do not be afraid of
opposition, for they are one and the same: to have enemies and to tell
the truth. And we will understand each other best when our mutual
understanding is based on the desire to hear the unvarnished truth.</p>
<p>Before I leave for Germany, this is what I wanted to say to you
today, and especially to our English friends.</p>
