While only moderately successful during his lifetime, Gauguin has since been recognized for his experimental use of color.",
          "By the 1890s, Gauguin's art took a significant turn during his time in Tahiti, then a French colony. During that time, he controversially married three adolescent Tahitian girls with whom he later fathered children.",
          "His paintings from that period, characterized by vivid colors and Symbolist themes, would prove highly successful among the European viewers for their exploration of the relationships between people, nature, and the spiritual world. Gauguin's art became popular after his death. His work was influential on the French avant-garde and many modern artists, such as Pabli Picasso and Henri Matisse, and he is well known for his relationship with Vincent and Theo van Gogh.",

There was also a German Waldorf school, although we didn’t know it when we first moved in: the Rudolf Steiner Schule.",

          "The Guidelines which have been sent from the Goetheanum to the members of the Anthroposophical Society during the past weeks link the psychic gaze to the beings of the spiritual realms, to which man is related above just as much as he is to the natural realms below.",
          "True self-knowledge can be the guide to these spiritual realms. And when such self-knowledge is striven for in the right way, one will find understanding for what anthroposophy imparts as knowledge derived from insight into the life of the spiritual world. One must only practice self-knowledge in the right way, and not by merely concentrating on the “inner self”.",
          "By means of such real self-knowledge, at first one encounters what is alive in remembrance. In thought-pictures he recalls to consciousness the shadows of what he directly experienced in the past. Upon seeing a shadow, one is directed by an inner urge of thinking to the object which cast the shadow. Whoever has a remembrance of something cannot arrive so directly in his mind at the experience which persists in the remembrance. But if he really reflects on his own being, he will have to say: “It is himself, in his soul, who created the experience which cast its shadow and made him what he is.” The remembrance-shadows arise in consciousness, and they are illuminated in the soul. Dead shadows live in remembrance; living Being resides in the soul in which remembrance continues to act.",

When we contemplate the great truths of existence, when we look up to the Forces, Powers and Beings who reveal themselves to us in the spiritual worlds as the cause and foundation of all that meets us in the sensory world. We rejoice to know that the truths which we bring down from the spiritual worlds will and must be gradually realized more and more in the souls and hearts of the people of the future. Thus for the greater part of the year our spiritual gaze is directed either to the immediate present or the future.",
          "All the more do we feel ourselves impelled on the special days of the year, on the Festivals which come through to us from time and its changes as reminders of what earlier humanity imagined and devised. On these feast days we feel ourselves impelled to realise our union with this earlier humanity, to sink ourselves a little into what led people of the past time out of fullness of heart and soul to place these marks in the course of time which come down to us as the ‘Festivals of the year.’ If the Easter Festival is such as to awaken in us, when we understand it, thoughts of human powers and of the power of overcoming all the lower through the higher, everything externally physical through the spiritual, if the Easter Festival is a festival of resurrection, of awaking, a festival of hope and confidence in the spiritual forces which can be awakened in the human soul; so, on the other hand, the Christmas Festival is a festival of the realization of harmony with the whole cosmos, a festival of the realization of Grace. It is a festival that can again and again bring home the thought: No matter how doubtful everything around us may appear, however much the bitterest doubts may enter into faith, however much the worst disappointments may mingle with the most aspiring hopes, however much all that is good around us in life may weaken, there is something in human nature and essence—the rightly understood thought of the Christmas Festival may say—that only needs to be brought livingly, spiritually, before the soul, which reveals to us that we are descended from the powers of good, from the forces of right, from the forces truth. Easter points us to our victorious forces in the future; Christmas points us, in a certain sense, to the origin of man in the primeval past.",

          "When you consider what has been said here during the past two days you will see that what belongs to the essence of imperialism is that in an imperialistic community something that was felt to be part of a mission – not necessarily justified, but understandable – later continued on as an automatism, so to speak. In the history of human development things are retained – simply due to indolence – which were once justified or explicable, but no longer are.",
          "If a community is obliged to defend itself for a period of time, then it is surely justified to create certain professions for that purpose: police and military professions. But when the danger against which defense was necessary no longer exists, the professions continue to exist. The people involved must remain. They want to continue to exercise their professions and therefore we have something which is no longer justified by the circumstances. Something develops which, although perhaps originating due to the necessity for defense, takes on an aggressive character. It is so with all empires, except the original imperialism of the first human societies, of which I spoke yesterday, in which the people’s mentality considered the ruler to be a god and thus justified in expanding his domain as far as possible. This justification was no longer there in all the subsequent empires.",

At my age men are at their best, but women are already going downhill. And when everything depends on one person it's very shaky. My situation recently became clear to me when we were with Everisto Gazzotti. Dr. Gazzotti behind his immense leather-trimmed desk; Peter Schmidt, owner of the Giroflex factory; Mr. Blaich, the imposing Waldorf School personality; Cido and Zéca - but the nucleus of it all was my own humble self.",

There's so much land in Brazil and not even a little piece for us. Something must happen in any case. Boxes, cases, sacks, suitcases full of Christmas presents are everywhere. The products of the children's work that they will give their parents for Christmas (35 sewn pillows, calendars, Christmas stars, etc.) and the used clothing for Londrina -- it all winds up here. Where should we store the three sacks of oats, the two sacks of cookies, the five packets of chocolate pieces, the used clothing, the 15 pairs of sneakers, the 30 pajamas for outings, the five doors, three lattices, toilets, bidet, a truck-load of wood??",

Not only were his colors and patterns uncommonly fine, but clothes made of this cloth, with the pockets full of conspiracy theories, had a wonderful way of becoming invisible to anyone who was unfit for his or her office, or who was unusually stupid and unhinged, or was not sufficiently loyal to the President.

          "To make that forecast, the historian conducted what he called “a more realistic assessment of domestic and global trends.” Starting with the global context, he argued that, “faced with a fading superpower,” China, India, Iran, and Russia would all start to “provocatively challenge U.S. dominion over the oceans, space, and cyberspace.” At home in the United States, domestic divisions would “widen into violent clashes and divisive debates… Riding a political tide of disillusionment and despair, a far-right patriot captures the presidency with thundering rhetoric, demanding respect for American authority and threatening military retaliation or economic reprisal.” But, that historian concluded, “the world pays next to no attention as the American Century ends in silence.”",

          "A few hours later we pulled into Fort Dix in New Jersey. All I remember about that place is that they gave us uniforms and shots against diseases I never heard of, and they had us cutting officers' lawns. After a couple of days some of us boarded another bus, this time an overnight journey to Fort Breckinridge in Kentucky — and things began to get interesting. The first shock was that we were in Company A, 101 Airborne Infantry Division. When we saw that sign over the door of the Company HQ, we almost fainted — figuratively of course. I ain't jumpin outta some airplane, someone yelled. We learned that 101 Airborne Division — also known as the Screaming Eagle — was now in a basic training mode, so we wouldn't be jumping any time soon.",
          "",
          "The war in Korea wasn't going very well at that time, something even those of us who kept up with the news weren't aware of because actual news reports, that is, those that told the public the truth, were far and in between those days. That meant that there were very few noncoms and officers around to train new guys like us because they were so badly needed in Korea. In fact, we only had the Company Commander, a lieutenant who was really a lawyer. Then there was First Sergeant Jackson, a battle-scarred veteran who was in Hawaii when the Japs attacked. He ran the company, but I guess First Sergeants run most companies. The Field First Sergeant was Silas Taylor, a wiry little guy from Georgia who had spent a lot of time in Korea, was wounded a few times, and even had a Silver Star. I was really surprised — we all were — to learn that he was only twenty-one years old, because he had eyes that looked a lot older. There were no more noncoms, except for Sgt. Alphabet, who ran the quartermaster section, so didn't really count. On our first day Sgt. Taylor asked if anyone had military experience. No one had, but one guy was a cop in civilian life, so they made him Acting Platoon Leader. Another guy was a lifeguard at Jones Beach, so they made him one too. And so on. I thought of mentioning that I had been a Boy Scout but decided not to. They probably would have made me Acting Company Commander.",
