<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>
<p class=MsoNormal><font face="verdana" size=4>A
boy from the village ran into
our yard at lunchtime on the fifth of January and announced at the top of his
lungs that the Three Kings were coming to the
schoolhouse that night at nine o’clock. That’s how news in Las
Chacras is announced – by word of mouth. I remembered that a neighbor had asked
for a donation to buy sweets and balloons a few days before. Making enquiries
on the main road, I found out that the Kings were scheduled to begin their
descent to the school from the <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>almacén</span>
at nine o’clock, which meant that they would more likely begin at nine-thirty
and arrive at ten. <br><br>My
wife, twelve-year-old son and I left the house at nine-thirty for the fifteen
minute walk to the one-room schoolhouse. We carried flashlights to light our
way down the narrow dirt road. Although we know the road well, it is advisable
not to walk without light in order to avoid the unpleasant surprise of stepping
on a snake – poisonous or not – or a scorpion. My son is too old to believe
that the Three Kings were coming to Las Chacras, but he wasn’t adverse to
receiving a bag of sweets and witnessing the spectacle. It was a beautiful
starlit evening, luckily not too warm.<br><br>

“Look!
There’s the Southern Cross,” Nico exclaimed suddenly as we approached the small
clearing marking the entrance to our nearest neighbor’s house.”<br><br>
“I don’t think so,” my wife said. “It looks too big to be the Cross.”<br><br>
“Yes, it is,” I said. “The size depends on what time of night you see it.” I wasn’t
sure of the accuracy of this affirmation, but didn’t want to disappoint Nico.<br><br>
At the main road, also unpaved, a good portion of Las Chacras’s population of two
hundred and fifty, at last unofficial census, was waiting in front of the
brightly lit schoolhouse for the Three Kings to arrive. The children’s
excitement and chattering charged the air. We switched off our flashlights and
exchanged greetings with those closest to us on the road – and waited. At
ten-fifteen Nico said, in English: “Well, are they coming or not?” <br><br>
At age ten, Nico, born and bred in Argentina, had discovered that he understood English and began to speak it. In two years time he was speaking English fluently, even reads Edgar Allan Poe and The New
Yorker. I consider this a noteworthy accomplishment because, although I am an
American and my Argentine wife speaks fluent English, we are, after all, in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Argentina</st1:place></st1:country-region> and mostly
speak Spanish at home. Credit therefore must go to the Beatles
ballads Nico loves to listen to on CDs, computer games and dish TV with its “<span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>Friends”</span> and the New York Mets baseball games.
When we lived in <st1:City w:st="on">Buenos Aires</st1:City> we didn’t even
have a TV, but here in the country where the nearest cinema is over a hundred
miles away and the cultural life of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Buenos
  Aires</st1:place></st1:City> six hundred, we have become victims of
technology. So now Nico speaks <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>only</span>
English to me, even when other people are present who don’t understand him,
including when shopping, walking down the street of the nearest real town,
Villa de las Rosas, or in school when I pick him up. Although this is probably
unconscious it is nevertheless impolite. More important, however, is that I
don’t like advertising that we are gringos in a place where North Americans are
generally considered responsible for most of the world’s ills. I have nothing
to do with the IMF, the World Bank, the Pentagon or the CIA and I definitely wouldn’t have
voted for Bush, but do <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>they</span>
know that?<br><br>

I reminded Nico that punctuality was not one of Las Chacras’ virtues and told him
to be patient. Neither Nico nor I are very patient people, however, and we both
walked up and down or around like first fathers in a maternity ward while my
wife chatted with some women.<br><br>
The rumor, having filtered through the crowd, finally reached us. Villa de las
Rosas was also sending Three Kings to the schoolhouse. Some smirked, some
laughed outright, as did I, and others merely frowned upon hearing the news. This
requires some explaining.<br><br>
Villa de las Rosas is a town of three thousand souls and is an incorporated
municipality. Las Chacras, a mile and a half from Las Rosas, is a rural
community without any official status. Las Rosas possesses, besides the City
Hall, a police station, a post office, a service station, several restaurants,
a primary and a high school, and an inn. Las Chacras has none of these, only
the one-room school and an almacén-taberna, or grocery store cum bar. The one
thing we have in abundance that Las Rosas lacks, in abundance, is water. And this commodity is worth
more than all the service stations and city halls this side of the sierras. The
water that serves Las Rosas comes from a dam a few miles away, and when the
artificial lake is low the water pressure is insufficient. Las Chacras gets its
water from mountain springs that would be pure if it weren’t for the animals up
high that defecate in the streams. But by the time it gets to us it’s good
enough for the residents, who develop antibodies to whatever bacteria is left
over. Tourists could have a problem, so nobody tells them, and usually they
don’t.<br><br>
There are a lot more voters in Las Rosas though, and all are screaming for more
water. The mayor and his cohorts therefore think – if you can call it thinking
– the obvious: take the water from Las Chacras by extending the pipes from here
to Las Rosas. When we heard about this (and around here secrets become public
knowledge immediately), our engineer made a study. Please understand that of
the 250 population of Las Chacras around twenty per cent are “outsiders”, that
is, refugees from <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Buenos Aires</st1:place></st1:City>,
and they include an engineer, a lawyer, a writer, as well as various varieties
of artisans. In order to be considered a local you have to have lived here at
least five generations. Anyway, our engineer made a study and informed us that
our water surplus would dwindle to a clap drip if the pipes are extended to Las
Rosas, because water will always strive to reach its destination first, then
back up and supply the lateral users with what’s left. In other words, Las
Rosas would consume “our” water and we would get the leftovers – if there were
any.<br><br>
This, obviously, is unacceptable. So we objected strenuously, to the extent of trying
to incorporate Las Chacras as an independent village that would have jurisdiction over the
water supply. That’s when Villa de las Rosas began to play dirty. The mayor,
Dr. Ignacio Circunsición, belongs to the same party as the governor of the
Province, Dr. Jorge Washington de <st1:PersonName ProductID="la Puta" w:st="on">la
 Puta</st1:PersonName>, which means that they play on the same team. The
Provincial Government can’t refuse the village incorporation outright, but they
can sure as hell sit on the papers as long as they damn please, then lose them
so everything has to be done over. Furthermore, the mayor of Las Rosas, in an
attempt to divide and conquer, spread the word that the “outsiders” in Las
Chacras were leading the locals by their noses. Normally this would be an
effective ploy, except that the spring of life, <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>water</span>, is involved, and for this issue locals and outsiders are
united. Our locals spread the word that any work on the pipes would need police
protection and it would be undone by them at night. They also threatened to
block the roads to traffic, burn tires and generally conduct a terrific
non-violent resistance campaign, complete with <i>cacerolazos</i>,
(pot-banging) and if it turned violent it would be the mayor’s fault. The
result until now has been an impasse during which we keep the water.<br><br>
When the word spread that three more kings were on their way from Villa de las Rosas
it was immediately evident to all but the densest among us that Mayor
Circuncisión was trying to convince us that he was a real nice guy and wouldn’t
think of leaving us without water.<br><br>
Cars passed occasionally so no one paid attention to a beat up red taxi lumbering up
the hill, until it stopped in front of the school and the driver got out and
put a rock under the rear right wheel because his emergency brake didn’t work. His
face was splotched by burnt cork and he wore a long gown that looked like his
grandmother’s nightgown. Two more similarly dressed royalties emerged from the
taxi, their faces splotched by the red of imbibing. All three placed yellow
cardboard crowns on their heads and retrieved bags of uninflated balloons from
the interior of the taxi. No one laughed because the children were staring at
them in awe.<br><br>
“The Magi arriving in a fucking <b>taxi</b>?” Nico exclaimed.<br><br>
“Shut up, kid,&quot; I told him, &quot;and watch your language."<br><br>
From the left, up the mountain, we heard tinny Christmas music. Having been diverted
by the decrepit Magi on our right, we hadn’t noticed the procession approaching
from the left: three wise kings mounted on Las Chacras camels – horses, as far
as I could tell, with bags stuffed with paper to form virtual humps on their
backs. Behind them chugged an old Chevy with a loudspeaker on its roof blaring
out the music. Meanwhile the taxi Magi were handing out scrawny plastic bags of
balloons to the kids while their parents scowled behind them with their arms
crossed. I sensed that an interesting close encounter was about to occur. Nico
had no intention of accepting a gift from such disreputable monarchs and
remained beside me tapping his foot.<br><br>
When the Las Chacras royal procession reached us, one of the kings tossed a fat
package to Nico as they passed on to the school. Nico inspected the transparent
bag filled with cookies, wrapped candies and balloons. A label pasted to the
package read: <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>Chacras Productions
invites you to a free showing of the movie “Shreck II” at Clara de Luna
tomorrow, 6<sup>th</sup>of January at 9 p.m. </span>Don’t be misled into
thinking that Las Chacras has a movie theater. Clara de Luna is Doctor Luna’s
house, where his wife operates a large-screen video venture. Normally they
charge one peso for admission. Whether “Shreck II” is an appropriate film for
Three Kings Day is a question no one – least of all myself – would care to ask.<br><br>
The lead Las Chacras king, black-faced, but recognizable as my gardener, Rovindo,
spotted the other kings handing out balloons and roared: <i>hijos de puta</i>,
and all three galloped the rest of the way to the school hurling blasphemies
worthy of next Saturday’s confessional, which their wives would surely make
them attend. They pulled their mounts up sharply and Rovindo jumped off and
grabbed his counterpart’s crown, threw it to the earth and shouted: <i>impostores</i>!
The other two Las Chacras kings followed his lead and finally all three crowns
were being trampled before the impostors’ trembling feet. Rovindo then told
them in no uncertain terms to depart the way they came or they’d get their
kingly asses kicked all the way to Villa de las Rosas. They hastily complied by
jumping into the taxi, which sped down the hill leaving behind a cloud of dust
that covered our kings and left them coughing and cursing.<br><br>
“Mamá,”
a little girl standing near me asked her mother, “what’s an <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>impostor</span>?”<br><br>
“It’s someone who isn’t what he says he is, dear.”<br><br>
“They weren’t real kings then, were they?”<br><br>
“No dear, they were impostors from Villa de las Rosas.”<br><br>
“Are the other kings real?”<br><br>
“Of course. They’re from Las Chacras”<br><br>
“But I thought they were from the Orient…”<br><br>Things
had calmed down by then and the Las Chacras Magi remounted. They rode back on
up to the almacen-taberna accompanied by self-satisfied, lukewarm applause. Nico had his
present so we turned homeward without waiting to hear how the young mother
would try to answer her daughter’s awkward query.<br><br>
“Look,
Dad, It <i>is</i> the Southern Cross,” Nico said. “But it seems smaller now. Why’s that?&quot;<br><br>
“Things aren't always what they seem, son.”<br><br>
Nico thought for a moment, then said, &quot;You can say <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>that</span> again, Dad.&quot;<br><br>
