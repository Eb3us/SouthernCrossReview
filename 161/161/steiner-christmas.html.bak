<p class="intro">From within our work in the Anthroposophical movement we look forward
into the future of humanity and we let our souls and hearts be permeated
with what we believe will embody itself in the streams and forces of
evolution in the future of humanity. When we contemplate the great
truths of existence, when we look up to the Forces, Powers and Beings
who reveal themselves to us in the spiritual worlds as the cause and
foundation of all that meets us in the sensory world. We rejoice to know
that the truths which we bring down from the spiritual worlds will and
must be gradually realized more and more in the souls and hearts of the
people of the future. Thus for the greater part of the year our
spiritual gaze is directed either to the immediate present or the
future.</p>
<p>All the more do we feel ourselves impelled on the special days of the
year, on the Festivals which come through to us from time and its
changes as reminders of what earlier humanity imagined and devised. On
these feast days we feel ourselves impelled to realise our union with
this earlier humanity, to sink ourselves a little into what led people
of the past time out of fullness of heart and soul to place these marks
in the course of time which come down to us as the ‘Festivals of the
year.’ If the Easter Festival is such as to awaken in us, when we
understand it, thoughts of human powers and of the power of overcoming
all the lower through the higher, everything externally physical through
the spiritual, if the Easter Festival is a festival of resurrection, of
awaking, a festival of hope and confidence in the spiritual forces which
can be awakened in the human soul; so, on the other hand, the Christmas
Festival is a festival of the realization of harmony with the whole
cosmos, a festival of the realization of Grace. It is a festival that
can again and again bring home the thought: No matter how doubtful
everything around us may appear, however much the bitterest doubts may
enter into faith, however much the worst disappointments may mingle with
the most aspiring hopes, however much all that is good around us in life
may weaken, there is something in human nature and essence—the rightly
understood thought of the Christmas Festival may say—that only needs to
be brought livingly, spiritually, before the soul, which reveals to us
that we are descended from the powers of good, from the forces of right,
from the forces truth. Easter points us to our victorious forces in the
future; Christmas points us, in a certain sense, to the origin of man in
the primeval past.</p>
<p>In such a case one can clearly see how the unconscious or
subconscious reason or spirituality of humanity stands far, higher than
man with his consciousness can wholly encompass. We have often reason to
admire what people have established in the past out of the hidden depths
of the soul more than what they have established out of their
intellectual thoughts and understanding. How infinitely wise it appears
to us, when we open the calendar, and for the 25th December we find
registered the Birth-Festival of the Christ Jesus, and then we see
registered in the calender for the 24th December “Adam and Eve”. How
clearly reasonable and spiritual it appears that out of the dim
subconscious work of the Middle Ages, when Christmas plays were
performed here or there about Christmas time by people from different
places, when the ‘singers’ as they were called gathered for their
Christmas plays, that the Paradise Tree should be brought forward. As in
the calender ‘Adam and Eve’ appeared before the Christ Birthday
Festival, so in the Christmas plays of the Middle Ages, the Tree of
Paradise was brought forward by the troupe which took part in the
performance. In short, there was something in the deep hidden
soul-depths of men which caused them to place directly together the
earthly beginning of humanity and the Jesus Birth Festival.</p>
<p>In the year 353, even in ecclesiastical Rome, the 25th December was
not kept as the Festival of the birth day of Jesus. Only in 354 the
Jesus Birthday Festival was celebrated for the first time in
ecclesiastical Rome. Previous to this, there was a festival which caused
a consciousness similar to the Jesus Birth Festival, namely, January the
6th, the day of remembrance of the baptism by John in the Jordan, the
day which was commemorative of the Descent of the Christ from the
spiritual heights, and the self-immersion of the Christ into the body of
Jesus of Nazareth. That was originally the Birth of the Christ in Jesus,
the remembrance of the great historical moment which is symbolically
presented to us as the hovering dove over the head of Jesus of Nazareth.
The 6th of January was the commemorative day of the birth of Christ in
Jesus of Nazareth.</p>
<p>In the fourth century, however, it had for a long time been
impossible for the materialistic philosophy of the West to understand
the incarnation of Christ in Jesus. The Gnostics, who were in a certain
respect contemporaries or direct followers of the Event of Golgotha,
realized this as a powerful illumination. They were in the position of
finding it unnecessary to seek the depth of this wisdom of the ‘Christ’
in ‘Jesus’ as we have to seek this wisdom again through modern
clairvoyance. The Gnostics were able, by means of the last flickering of
those old, original human clairvoyant powers to see in the light of
grace what we must acquire again for ourselves: the great secrets of
Golgotha. Much was clear to the Gnostics which we have to acquire again,
in particular the secret of the birth of Christ in Jesus during the
baptism by John in the Jordan.</p>
<p>Just as the old clairvoyance faded away for humanity generally, so
did also the kindling of the highest clairvoyant power, of the highest
Christmas light of humanity, which the Gnostics possessed. In the fourth
century western Christianity was no longer able to understand this great
thought. Hence in the fourth century the true meaning of the festival of
the appearance of the Christ in Jesus was lost to Western civilization.
Humanity had forgotten what this Festival of the 6th of January actually
meant. They had for a time, right into our time, buried under much
materialistic intellectual rubbish what indeed would not allow itself to
be destroyed, the feeling toward the Christ-Figure in human
evolution.</p>
<p>If man could not understand that a highest one, as compared with
humanity, had manifested Himself in the Baptism by John in the Jordan,
yet he could understand—for that did not contradict materialistic
knowledge—that the bodily organism which was selected for the reception
of the Christ was something significant. Hence they put back the
Spirit-birth, which indeed took place in the John-Baptism in the Jordan,
to the birth of the Jesus child, and set the ‘Jesus-Birth-Festival’ in
place of the ‘Festival of the Appearing.’ To represent quite rightly and
in detail, what became the Christmas Festival, always aroused
significant feelings, exalted feelings. Something significant lived in
the human soul at the approach of Christmas, which may be expressed as
follows: If man contemplates the world in the right sense, he can, by
belief in humanity, fortify himself against certain things, against all
life’s dangers and blows of fate; in the feeling of love and peace man
can fortify himself in his deepest soul against all of life’s disharmony
and strife. This is something which becomes ever more clearly bound up
with the Christmas Festival. What was it actually which humanity
remembered?</p>
<p>We know what significant, real and powerful preparations human
evolution had to go through in order that the Mystery of Golgotha could
enter this evolution. The human being who was the reincarnated
Zarathustra, had to be born as one of the two Jesus children. He also
had to be born for whom the real Jesus-Birth-Festival was the
commemorative festival; he had to be born whose soul-substance had
remained in the spiritual worlds. So long as humanity went through all
that was possible within heredity through the generations up to the
Mystery of Golgotha, so long had man been absorbing the destructive
forces that crept right into the blood. One single soul substance had
remained behind in the spiritual worlds, guarded by the purest Mysteries
and Mystery-centers, and then it was poured out into humanity as the
soul of the second Jesus-child, the child of the Luke Gospel, that
Jesus-child to whose birth all the commemorations and representations of
the Christ-Festival, of Christmas, belong.</p>
<p>At Christmas people’s thoughts went back to the origin of humanity,
to the human soul, which had not yet descended, not even into Adam’s
nature. They would say: In Bethlehem, in Palestine was born that
soul-substance which had not taken part in the descent of humanity, but
had remained behind, and for the first time in fact entered into a human
body, in incarnating in Jesus, as described by Luke. The human soul,
when its thinking is directed to this fact, may feel: One can believe in
humanity, one can have faith in humanity; however much conflict, however
much disbelief, however much disharmony has entered into it from the
time of Adam to the present—when one looks back on what in olden times
was called ‘Adam Kadmon,’ which became later the ‘Christ’ conception,
there was kindled in the human soul confidence in the soundness of
humanity, and there was kindled confidence in the primeval peaceful and
loving nature of humanity. Hence the subconscious soul of man brought
together the Jesus-birth Festival and the Adam and Eve Festival because
he saw in fact his own nature, but in its innocence and its purity, in
the Christ Child who was born.</p>
<p>Why then was the Divine Child placed before humanity for hundreds and
thousands of years as the highest there was for the human soul to
revere? For the reason that when person looks at a child and sees the
child not yet able to say ‘I’ to himself, he can know that the child is
still working on the human body, the Temple of the Eternally Divine, and
because the human child who cannot yet say ‘I’ nevertheless clearly
shows the sign of his origin from the spiritual world. Through this
contemplation of the child’s nature one learns to have full trust in
human nature. Here, where he can most easily gather with others, when
the sun shines least and warms the earth least, when he is not busied
with the ordering of his outer affairs, here, when the days are shortest
and the nights longest, when the earth gives him the best opportunity to
enter into himself, when all outer brightness, all outer beauty
withdraws for a while from outward view—here, Western civilisztion
places the Birth-Festival of the Divine Child, that is, of the Human
Being who enters the world pure and unsullied—and through the innocent
entrance into the world can give to man at the time of his closest
assembling with others, the strongest, the highest confidence through
the knowledge of his own divine origin.</p>
<p>To the anthroposophist it is a confirmation of the great truth that
one can learn most from the child, when one sees that a festival of a
child’s birth is placed in the course of time as a great significant
festival of confidence in human evolution. So we admire the
subconscious, the spiritual reason of the human beings of the past, who
have placed such sign posts in the path of time. We feel then like those
who decipher wonderful hieroglyphs, produced by the people of old
through the placing of such festivals in the writing of the times and we
feel one with these folks of old. While at other times our gaze is
directed towards the future, while at other times we are willing to
place our best powers at the disposal of the future, to strengthen and
increase all faith in the future, here, on such festival days, we seek
to live in remembrance, to draw towards us as though incarnated the old
thoughts teaching us at the present time that we can think about what
lies in the spiritual foundation of the external world. But in earlier
times—in a different way, it is true, but not less right, not less
magnificent and significant—the True and Sublime was thought and
experienced through the realization of the oneness of humanity and the
great possibilities that then lay ahead of humanity. This is our
anthroposophical ideal, to be able to feel one with what the folks of
old produced—often from the most hidden depths of the soul. These
festivals, particularly the great ones, encourage this, if we can only
through the anthroposophical truths imprint in our souls the
significance of the hieroglyphic signs written in the path of time.</p>
<p>A wonderful thought unites with a wonderful emotion in our souls when
we see how, in those centuries which followed the fourth which first
transferred the Jesus-Birth Festival to the 25th of December, how there
flowed into the souls of those people the feeling of confidence awakened
through the child-nature, so that in painting, in the Christmas plays,
everywhere, is shown how all the creatures of the Earth-kingdom bow
before the Jesus Child, before the Divine Child, before the divine
origin of man.</p>
<p>There comes before us the wonderful picture of the manger, how the
beasts bow before this primal man; to these may be added those wonderful
stories, as for instance that when Mary had taken the Child Jesus on the
way to Egypt a tree bowed, a very ancient tree, as the border was
crossed by Mary with the child. Traditionally the legends of almost the
whole of Europe relate that the trees in a remarkable way, in the Holy
Night, bow to this great event. We could go to Alsace, to Bavaria,
everywhere we find legends, how certain trees bear fruit on the Holy
Night. All wonderful symbols which proclaim in fact how the birth of the
Jesus-Child reveals itself as something which is connected with the
whole life of the earth. When we recollect what we have so often
said—that the ancient spiritual streams were given by the Gods to
mankind, and how in ancient times people had clairvoyant insight into
the divine spiritual world, how this clairvoyance gradually vanished
from humanity in order that human beings might be able to gain the “I”.
If we picture how here, in the whole human organization, something like
a drying-up, a withering, of the old divine forces was taking place, and
how through the Christ-Impulse which came through the Mystery of
Golgotha there was a flooding of the withering divine forces with a new
water of life; then there appears to us in a wonderful picture what the
Christmas legends relate to us: how the dried up and withered roses of
Jericho shoot up of themselves in the Holy Night. That is a legend which
we find everywhere noted down in the Middle Ages, that the roses of
Jericho blossom in the Christ-night and unfold, because they first
unfolded under the footsteps of Mary, who, when she carried the Child
Jesus on the journey to Egypt, stepped over a place where a rose tree
was growing. A wonderful symbol of what happened to human divine powers,
that even things so dry and lifeless as that which one usually finds on
the wayside, as the roses which apparently are dead, can spring up again
and shoot forth through the Christ-Impulse which entered into
evolution.</p>
<p>That in the festival of the Birth of the Jesus infant was first given
to humanity what was destined from the beginning. Before Adam and Eve
existed, was destined for humanity—so the Christmas legend says—what yet
lies in the quite unspoilt divine child-nature of man. In truth
however—and on account of the influence of Lucifer—man has only been
able to attain it after the period of time from Adam and Eve to the
Mystery of Golgotha.</p>
<p>A deep emotion awakens in our souls when we take for our meditation a
feeling, compressed into the one night of the 24th and 25th of December,
of what mankind has become from Adam and Eve to the birth of Christ in
Jesus, through the Luciferic powers. If we can realize that, we shall
really grasp the significance of this Festival, and understand the goal
before humanity. It is as though humanity, if it would use its
opportunity and take these sign posts of time as material for
meditation, could really become aware of its pure origin in the cosmic
forces of the universe. Here, looking up into the cosmic forces of the
universe and penetrating a little by means of Anthroposophy, through
true spiritual wisdom into the secrets of the universe, humanity can
first become mature to understand this, that what as the Christ-Birth
Festival was once understood by the Gnostics, was in fact the festival
celebrated on January the 6th, the Festival of the Birth of Christ in
the body of Jesus of Nazareth, as a higher stage of the Birth-Festival
of Jesus. To enable us to plunge into the twelve great Forces of the
universe, the twelve Holy Nights are set between the Christmas Festival
and the festival which is to be celebrated on the sixth of January,
which now is the festival of the Three Holy Kings, and which in fact is
the festival we have been speaking about.</p>
<p>Again, without man’s really knowing it in present knowledge, these
twelve Holy Nights are established out of the hidden wise depths of the
soul of mankind, as though they would say: ‘Realise the depths of the
Christmas Festival, but sink during the twelve Holy Nights into the
holiest secrets of the cosmos, that is, in the realms of the universe
out of which Christ descended to the Earth.’ Only when mankind wills to
be inspired through the thought of the holy childlike divine origin of
man, to let himself be inspired by the wisdom that works through the
twelve forces, through the twelve holy forces of the universe,
symbolically presented in the twelve signs of the Zodiac, due in truth
to spiritual wisdom—only when mankind sinks into true spiritual wisdom
and learns to discern the course of time in the great cosmos and in the
single human being, only then will the mankind of the future, fructified
through Spiritual Science, find to its own salvation the inspiration
which can come from the Jesus-Birth Festival so that thoughts for the
future may be permeated with fullest confidence and hope.</p>
<p>Thus we may as anthroposophists allow the Christmas Festival to work
on our souls as an inspiration festival, as a festival that brings the
thought of human origin in the holy divine primeval human child so
wonderfully before our souls. That light which appears to us in the Holy
Night as the symbol of the light of humanity at its source, that light
which is symbolically presented to us later in the lights of the
Christmas-tree, rightly understood, is the Light that can give to our
striving souls the best and strongest forces for our true world-peace,
for the true blessedness and hope for the world.</p>
<p>Let us feel ourselves strengthened for the needs of the future by
such thoughts on the facts of the past, on the establishing of the
festivals in the past; Christmas thoughts, remembrance of the origin of
humanity, thought that will unfold to real, to mighty soul implants for
the true future of humanity.</p>
