        <p>Dear Frank</p>
        <p>
          Thank you for sending your paper. I think that it is very good, not
          exaggerated, and certainly not too harsh. You are above all posing
          questions rather than passing judgments, but the questions alone point
          to the unclarity -- the lack of consciousness -- that weaves through
          all of the ahrimanic aspects of the Society as an organization, legal
          entity, institution, and so on. I hope that what you have written
          finds a wider audience, although I think that the history that you are
          trying to clarify may be hopelessly muddled by now.
        </p>
        <p>
          I joined the GAS in 1972 with the encouragement of Dr Paul Scharff. My
          wife and I had been studying Steiner independently for four years, and
          when we became coworkers at the Fellowship Community Paul told me that
          as a member I would be able to become a helpful presence in the ASA.
          (I, too, have a card signed by Rudolf Grosse.) In the early 80s I was
          invited to lead a workshop at the big conference held in Spring Valley
          in which several Vorstand members visited the USA for the first time
          and spoke about the need for another Geotheanum on our continent. I
          can't say that I was very impressed with those lectures, nor was I
          deeply moved by the many communications that came from Dornach. I also
          had many, many conversations with elderly residents of the Fellowship
          who had known Steiner personally, some of whom had been present at the
          formation of the <em>real</em> Society and who shared with me the
          conflicts of the Frau Doktor and Ita Wegman and Albert Steffen and the
          labyrinthine complications that led to the present state of affairs.
        </p>
        <p>
          For a number of reasons, I withdrew from the ASA (and the GAS) at the
          turn of the century. For some hidden bureaucratic reason, Dornach and
          the ASA still treat me like a member, and I continue to be invited by
          groups and branches to give anthroposophical lectures. I try to stay
          informed, via <em>Das Goetheanum</em> and reports from
          conference-going friends, of the Society's activities, and I do not
          have any regrets about working independently.
        </p>
        <p>
          In short, I deeply appreciate your own efforts to work with
          Anthroposophy as a Michaelite and a member of the brotherhood of free
          spirits. Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me.
        </p>

          Good article Frank Thomas.  Since becoming a member in 1990, I always
          wondered why things weren't working.

        <p>Dear Frank,</p>
        <p>
          it is a very interesting story. However, a more important reason
          behind the present (shameful) state of any antroposophical society is
          simply the level of consciousness of us. You know the 'cosmic gossip':
          Manas will only begin in 3573, that is more than 1500 years from now,
          and without 'It' (i.e. initiated people), our fine organizations lack
          the only purpose they were made for: the Spirit (Self).

          Was not the Gelebte Weinachs Tage  a continuation of this ? The GAS
          lost, and the building verein won. A lot of members lost Class
          membership. I have wondered how the GAS paid off its fine.

          After reading I was kind of surprised you didn't go a bit further with
          your story. Wasn't something done a few years ago to try and undue
          some of the mess and where members participated in a vote on a
          reorganization of some kind? Since so little communication and
          discussion took place in this country, I really didn't know the issues
          or why the vote was necessary. Only that there was another group who
          were protesting and they were basically overruled by the vote. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I have a Anthroposophical membership card 1991 from ASIA which has the
          same symbol as on your card. It is essentially the same message.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have a First Class membership card 1995 on which the symbol has been
          changed but essentially acknowledges my membership. Both signed for
          the Goetheanum by Manfred Brabant.  
        </p>
        <p>Both have on the reverse the card return conditions.</p>

        <p>Dear  Frank,</p>
        <p>
          Another wonderful article in Southern Cross Review. I thought the two
          "Jesus Children" was complicated! Seems easier than the convolution of
          actions by both societies. Perhaps we could get rid of the circular
          firing squad that seems operate in the society and get back to the
          original task: saving humanity. I would suggest there is enough you
          could serialize the initial article with discussion of some of the
          egregious actions taken in the name of anthroposophy. Jim Stewart, the
          founder of the RS Archives has a plethora of information.
        </p>

          I wish you a Holy Season and New Year filled with Light, Laughter and
          Love.

          My personal viewpoint of the State of the Anthoposophical Movement:
        </p>
        <p>
          Give to us, we deserve it,<br />
          Give us all your money!<br />
          If you do, and when you do,<br />
          Your future will be sunny!<br />
          Tell me quickly, I can't wait,<br />
          About what Steiner said!<br />
          I'm real busy, I need to know,<br />
          What all was in his head!<br />
          Material things are the rule<br />
          Gimme, gimme, and ...<br />
          There are those in charge, now,<br />
          Disciples of Ayn Rand!<br />
          I think Steiner was on drugs!<br />
          That he must have been<br />
          Got no real proof, I'm just sayin'<br />
          I got this from within!<br />
          In Dornach they are squabbling, too.<br />
          Who has all the rights?<br />
          This sets a fine example ...<br />
          The territorial fights!<br />
          This is what is out there,<br />
          An Ahrimanic trap.<br />
          Set by his damned minions,<br />
          To fill us full of crap!<br />
          Yes, it's there, and yes I care, and<br />
          I don't mean to complain ...<br />
          But the Anthroposophical Movement,<br />
          Is being taken down the drain!

          I have a very small group of friends to study readings and writings by
          Steiner. Here in Curaçao, Caribbean (although still part of the Dutch
          Kingdom).

              I think the expression "spiritual science" is not correct. How can
              a science be spiritual? My wording is "science of the spirit",
              which is a literal translation of Geisteswisseschaft. Giestes is
              genitive, and not an adjective. In the latter case, it would have
              been geistige Wissenchaft. But I prefer using Anthroposophy,
              because whenever the general public reads or hears "science
              something", they will immediately compare with natural science.

          It happens that reincarnation is absolutely clear in Mathew 11:14:
          John the Baptist was a reincarnation of Elijah
        </p>
        <p>
          For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John. <strong

          <em>it</em>, <strong>this is Elias, which was for to come.</strong> 
        </p>
        <p>
          The Churches ignore this. They had to do it, otherwise mankind would
          not separate itself from the spirit and develop free will.

        <p>
          One has to distinguish incorporation (Christ into Jesus lower

          Ask a materialist to prove that he is thinking on something, or he is
          having a sensation (the taste of a fruit) or a feeling (liking or
          disliking that taste), or that he is feeling hungry, that is making
          someone having HIS thoughts, feelings and willing. This is all occult,
          so materialists are occult! Note that electrical impulses in the brain
          are NOT the thoughts, feelings and willing.

          V.W.S.: This is an empty accusation implying that the Israeli army is

          civilians in Gaza could have been spared? Nobody knows. Also, take
          into account that the Khamas lies ostensively. Nobody knows how many
          civilians died. It's a pity that you have mixed politics with

          Paradox of Value: Redefining Worth as a Woman. I have sent it to her
          to include as a lovely reflection during the course.

          I am studying for my Spiritual Direction Certification – and have
          printed your poem for use with my directees. It speaks of the beauty
          of silence and the wonder of God’s creation. It also reminds us that
          we should not look for feedback and acclaim from those in this world –
          but keep our eyes focused on God. It is His opinion that matters and
          we often hear His voice in His creation.

          Thank you for a beautiful and thought-provoking poem. I am an engineer
          who is just now discovering the wonder of poetry. You are truly
          gifted. Thank you.

          Thank you, Frank. Much needed inspiration in a time of turmoil. 
          Christmas blessings to you and yours,

          So in the southern temperate regions we could consider it more
          appropriate to celebrate these births during the shortest days and
          longest nights of our year ‐ namely from 23 June for 13 nights until 7
          July?

        <p>Dear Frank,</p>
        <p>
          Congratulations for your dedicated work for over a quarter of a
          century! Another quarter, and you are good to go :)
        </p>
        <p>Cheers, Norbert Hanny</p>

          PS.: I had the privilege to personally interpret for Judith von Halle,
          3 weeks ago, in Budapest. It really was an uplifting experience, which
          I expected, but in a totally unexpected way. Her behaviour was simple,
          natural, very human in every sense of the word. She was one of us -
          still, the whole circle of people kind of became ONE somehow. Anyway
          :)
