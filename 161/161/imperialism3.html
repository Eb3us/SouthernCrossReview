<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 13pt">When
you consider what has been said here during the past two days you
will see that what belongs to the essence of imperialism is that in
an imperialistic community something that was felt to be part of a
mission &ndash; not necessarily justified, but understandable &ndash;
later continued on as an automatism, so to speak. In the history of
human development things are retained &ndash; simply due to indolence
&ndash; which were once justified or explicable, but no longer are.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 13pt">If
a community is obliged to defend itself for a period of time, then it
is surely justified to create certain professions for that purpose:
police and military professions. But when the danger against which
defense was necessary no longer exists, the professions continue to
exist. The people involved must remain. They want to continue to
exercise their professions and therefore we have something which is
no longer justified by the circumstances. Something develops which,
although perhaps originating due to the necessity for defense, takes
on an aggressive character. It is so with all empires, except the
original imperialism of the first human societies, of which I spoke
yesterday, in which the people's mentality considered the ruler to be
a god and thus justified in expanding his domain as far as possible.
This justification was no longer there in all the subsequent empires.
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 13pt">Let
us now consider once again from definite viewpoints what is apparent
in the historical evolution of mankind. We find that in the oldest
times the will of the individual who was seen as divine was the
indisputable power factor. In public life there was in reality
nothing to discuss in such empires; but this impossibility of
discussion was grounded in the fact that a god in human form walked
the earth as the ruler. That was, if I may say so, a secure
foundation for public affairs.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 13pt">Gradually
all that which was based on divine will and was thus secure passed
over to the second stage. In that stage the things which can be
observed in physical life, be they persons, be they the persons'
insignias, be they the deeds of the governing or ruling persons, it
was all symbols, signs. Whereas during the first phase of imperialism
here in the physical world the spirit was considered directly
present, during the second stage everything physical was thought of
as a reflection, as an image, as a symbol for what is not actually
present in the physical world, but only illustrated by the persons
and deeds in the physical world.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 13pt">Such
times, when the second stage appeared, was when it first occurred to
people that a possibility for discussion of public affairs was
possible. What we today call rights can hardly be considered as
existing during the first stage. And the only political institution
worth mentioning was the phenomenon of divine power exercised by
physical people. In social affairs the only thing that mattered was
the concrete will of a physical person. To try to judge whether this
will was justified or not makes no sense. It was just there. It had
to be obeyed. To discuss whether the god in human form should or
should not do this or that made no sense. In fact it was not done
during those times when the conditions I have described really
existed. But if one only saw an image of the spiritual world in
physical institutions, if one  spoke of what Saint Augustine called
the &ldquo;City of God&rdquo; - that is, the state which exists here
on earth, but which is really an image of heavenly facts and
personalities, then one can hold the opinion that what the person
does who is a divine image is right, is a true image: someone else
could object and say that it is not a true image. That's when the
possibility of discussion originated. The person of today, because he
is accustomed to criticize everything, to discuss everything, thinks
that to criticize and discuss was always present in human history.
That is not true. Discussing and criticizing are attributes of the
second stage, which I have described for you. Thus began the
possibility to judge on one's own, that is, to add a predicate to a
subject. In the oldest forms of human expression this personal
judging was not at all present in respect to public affairs. During
the second stage what we call today parliament for example was in
preparation; for a parliament only makes sense when it is possible to
discuss  public affairs. Therefore, even the most primitive form of
public discourse was a characteristic of the second stage.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 13pt">Today
we live in the third stage, insofar as the characteristic form of the
western countries more or less spreads over the world. This is the
stage of platitudes. This stage of platitudes, as I characterized it
to you yesterday, is the one in which the inner substance has also
disappeared from discussion and therefore everyone can be right, or
at least think that they are right, when it can't be proved that they
are wrong, because basically within the world of platitudes
everything can be affirmed. Nevertheless, previous stages are always
retained within the next stages. Therefore the inner impulse to
imperialism exists. People observe things very superficially. When
the previous German kaiser wrote in a book that was opened out to
write in: &ldquo;The king's will is sublime law&rdquo; &ndash; what
did it mean? It meant that he expressed himself in the age of
platitudes in a manner that only had meaning for the first stage. In
the first stage it was really the case that the ruler's will was
highest law. The concept of rights, which includes the right of free
speech, and involves lawyers and courts, is essentially a
characteristic of the second stage, and can only be grasped in its
reality from the viewpoint of the second stage. Whoever has followed
how much discussion has taken place about the origin and character of
rights will have noticed that there is something shimmering in the
rights concept as such, because it is applicable to the symbolic
stage, where the spiritual shimmers through the material, shines, so
that when only the external signs, the legal aspects and words
appear, one can argue and discuss what are rights and the legal
system in public discourse.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 13pt">In
the age of the platitudes, however, understanding of what is
necessary for rights in society is completely lost: that the
spiritual kingdom shines through into the physical kingdom. And then
one  arrives at such definitions as I described yesterday using the
example of Woodrow Wilson.  I will now read to you a definition of
the law that Woodrow Wilson gave so you can see how this definition
consists of nothing but platitudes. He said: &ldquo;The law is the
will of the state in respect to those citizens who are bound by it.&rdquo;
So the state unfolds a will! One can well imagine that someone who is
embedded so strongly in abstract idealism, not to mention materialism
&ndash; for they are practically the same &ndash; can claim that the
state is supposed to have a will. He would have to have lost all
sense of reality to even conceive of such a thing let alone write it
down. But it is in the book I spoke to you about yesterday &ndash;
the codex of platitudes: <I>The State, Elements of Historical and
Practical Politics.</I> </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 13pt">There
are other interesting things in it. Only in parenthesis I would like
to draw your attention to what Wilson says in this book about the
German Empire after he describes how the efforts to found it were
finally successful in 1870/71. He describes this with the following
sentences: &ldquo;The final incentive for achievement of complete
national unity was brought about by the  German-French war of
1870/71. Prussia's brilliant success in this struggle, fought in the
interest of German patriotism against French impertinence, caused the
cool restraint of the central states towards their powerful neighbor
in the north to end; they united with the rest of Germany and the
German Empire was founded in the royal palace at Versailles on
January 18, 1871.&ldquo; The same man wrote that who a short time
later in Versailles united with those whose impertinence had once
been the motivation for the founding of the German Empire. Much of
present day public opinion derives from the fact that people are so
terribly superficial and pay no attention to the facts. If you decide
to decide according to objective information, then things look quite
different from what is propounded in public and accepted by thousands
upon thousands of people. It wouldn't have hurt one bit if when
Woodrow Wilson arrived in Paris in glory, praised from all sides, if
these remarks had been held up to him. That is what must be striven
for, to take the facts into account, which means also the truth.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 13pt">So
the second stage is when discussion arises, which is what makes the
civil rights concept  possible. The third stage is when economic life
is the essential reality.  And yesterday we showed how this [present]
age of platitudes is absolutely necessary in the course of historical
evolution in order that the platitude, which is empty, can open
people's eyes to the fact that the only reality is economic life and
how it is therefore so necessary to propagate spirituality, the new
spirituality in the world.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 13pt">People
have quite a skimpy idea about this new spiritual life. And it is
therefore understandable that it is burdened with the most ridiculous
misunderstandings.  For this new spirituality must penetrate into the
depths of human life. And although those secret societies, about
which I spoke yesterday, only traditionally preserve the old forms,
the slogan &ldquo;brothers&rdquo;, meaning not to let social class or
an individual's religion play a part in the lodges, in a certain
sense does prepare for it in the right way.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 13pt">We
say today &ndash; I beg you to pay special attention to this, let's
take something quite banal, quite common: &ldquo;The tree is green&rdquo;.
This is a manner of speaking which is common to  the second stage of
human development. Perhaps you will understand me better if you
imagine that we try to paint this opinion &ndash; that &ldquo;the
tree is green&rdquo;. You cannot paint it!  There will be some white
surface and green will be added, but nothing about the tree has been
painted.  And when something of the tree is painted which isn't green
all you do is disturb the effect even more. If you try to paint &ldquo;The
tree is green&rdquo;, you are painting something dead. The way we
combine subject and predicate in our speech is only useful for our
view of the dead, of the non-living in the world. As we still have no
idea of how everything in the world is alive, and how to express
ourselves about what is alive, we form such judgments as &ldquo;The
tree is green&rdquo;, which presupposes that a relationship exists
between something and the color green, whereas the color green is
itself the creative element, the force which acts and lives. The
transformation of human thinking and feeling will have to take place
within the innermost life of the soul. This will take a long time to
accomplish, but when it does it will affect social conditions and how
people relate to each other. </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 13pt">Today
we are only at the beginning of all this. But it is necessary to know
which paths lead to the light. I have said that it is meaningful when
people get together and each one's subjective beliefs play no role.
And consider it from this viewpoint &ndash; really think about it &ndash;
the way in which anthroposophy is described. It is not described
through definitions or ordinary judgments. We try to create images,
to present things from the most varied sides, and it is senseless to
try and nail down something meant in a spiritual-scientific sense
with a mere yes or no opinion. People today always want to do that,
but it isn't possible.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 13pt">In
happens ever more frequently &ndash; because we are growing out of
the second stage and into the third &ndash; that someone asks: What
is good for me in order to counter this  or that difficulty in life?
Advice is given. Aha! The person concerned says, so in this or that
situation in life one must  do this or that. They generalize. But it
has only a limited meaning, for judgments given from the spiritual
world always only have only an individual meaning, are only
applicable to one case. This way of generalizing, which we have
become accustomed to in the second stage, must not continue into the
third stage. People today are very much inclined to carry things over
from the past into the future. One can become disinclined towards the
things which are pernicious for the soul by seeing clearly what is
happening. </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 13pt">Yesterday
I indicated to you that in many respects the Catholic Church harks
back to the first stage. It contains something like a sham or a
shadow of the first stage of human evolution, which  sometimes
solidifies into a kind of spiritual imperialism,  as for example in
the 11th century when the <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluny_Abbey">Monks of Cluny 
</A> ruled over Europe more than than is thought. From their ranks
the powerful, imperialistic Pope Gregory VII emerged.  Therefore
Roman Catholic dogma enables the priest to feel greater than Christ,
because he can force him to be present at the altar. This clearly
shows that the institution of the Catholic Church is a relic, a
shadow-image of what existed in the very first imperialism. </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 13pt">You
know that a great enmity existed between the Catholic Church and the
secret societies which used Freemasonry in the west &ndash; a certain
form of Freemasonry at least &ndash; as their instrument. It would go
too far in this lecture to describe in detail how this enmity has
gradually increased over time. But one thing can be said, how  in
these secret societies the opinion is very strong that the Catholic
Church is a relic of the first stage of imperialism. The Holy Roman
Empire used this framework to have Charlemagne and the Ottos crowned 
by the pope, thereby using the imperialism of the soul as the means
of mundane anointment. They took what still remained from older times
and poured it into the new. Thus the imperialism of the second stage
was poured into the framework of the first imperialism.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 13pt">Now
we have arrived at the third stage, which shows itself to be economic
imperialism, especially in the west. This economic imperialism is
connected to a background culture of secret societies, which are
sated with empty symbols. But while it has become clear that the
social constitution of the Church is a shadow-image of what once
existed and no longer has meaning, it is still not understood that in
the second stage the statesmen of the west still suffer under a great
illusion. Woodrow Wilson would no longer speak of the will of the
Church, but he speaks of the will of the State as being self-evident.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 13pt">But
the state only had the importance attributed to it during the second
stage of human development. Whereas  during the oldest, the first
stage the Church was all-powerful, in the second stage the state
contains everything that was attributed to the Church in the first
stage.  Thus the economic imperialism of Great Britain and even a
certain idea of freedom has been poured into the state.  And those
who were educated in Great Britain see in the state something that
can well have a will of its own.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 13pt">But
we must perceive that this concept of the state must take the same
road the concept of the Church has traveled.  It must be realized: If
we retain this concept of the state for the entire social organism, a
mere rights institution, and force everything else into this rights
institution, we are propagating a shadow just as the Church has
propagated a shadow &ndash; recognized as such by the secret
societies. There is little awareness of this though. Think of all the
public affairs that people are enthusiastic about which are pressed
into the concept of the political state. There are nationalists,
chauvinists and so forth; everything we call nation, national ,
chauvinism, it's all incorporated into  the framework of the state. 
Nationalism is added and the concept of the &ldquo;nation-state&rdquo;
is construed. Or we may have a certain opinion about, say socialism,
even radical socialism: the framework of the state is used. Instead
of nationalism, socialism is incorporated. But then we have no
concept; it can only be a shadow-image, as the constitution of the
Church has become.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 13pt">In
some Protestant circles the idea has arisen that the Church is only
the visible institution, that the essence of religion must take root
in people's hearts.  But this degree of human development has not yet
arrived in respect to the political state, otherwise we wouldn't be
trying to squeeze all kinds of nationalisms into the political
boundaries which exist as the result of the war [First World War &ndash;
trans.] All this neglects to take one thing into consideration &ndash;
the fact that what occurs in the historical development of humanity
is life and not mechanism. And a characteristic of life is that it
comes and goes. The imperialistic approach is different however.
According to this approach one does not think about the future. This
is part of the present-day approach to public affairs, that people
have no living thoughts, only dead ones. They think: Today we
instituted something, it is good, therefore it must remain forever.
The feminist movement thinks like this, as do the socialists and the
nationalists. We have founded something, it begins with us,
everything waited for us until we became clever enough. And now we
have discovered the cleverest that exists and it will continue to
exist forever. It's as though I have brought up a child until he is
eighteen years old and I say: I have brought him up correctly, and he
will stay as he is. But he will get older, and he will also die, as
does everything in the course of human evolution.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 13pt">Now
I come to what I mention before about what must accompany the
principle of indifference to one's religious beliefs  and fraternity.
 What must accompany them is the awareness that life on earth
includes death and that we are aware that the institutions we create
must of necessity also cease to exist, because the death principle
already resides in them and they therefore have no wish to exist
forever, do not consider being permanent. </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 13pt">Of
course under the influence of the thinking characteristic of the
second stage this is not possible . But if the feeling of shame of
which I spoke yesterday arises, when we realize that we are living in
the kingdom of platitudes under which only economic imperialism
glimmers &ndash; then will we call for the spirit, invisible but
real. We will call for a knowledge of the spirit, one which speaks of
an invisible kingdom, a kingdom which is not of this world in which
the Christ-impulse can actually gain a foothold. </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 13pt">This
can only happen when the social order is tripartite, threefold: The
economy is auto-administered, the political state is no longer the
absolute, all-inclusive entity, but is exclusively concerned with
with rights alone, and spiritual/cultural life is truly free, meaning
that here in reality a free spiritual sector can be organized. The
spiritual life of humanity can only be free if it is dependent only
upon itself and when all the institutions responsible for cultivating
the spirit, that is, cultural life, are dependent only upon
themselves. </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 13pt">What
do we have then, when we have this tripartite organism, this social
organism? We have an economy in which the living physical earth is
predominant. In this sector the economic forces  of the economy
itself are active. I doubt anyone will think that if the economy is
organized as described in my book <a href="https://southerncrossreview.org/Ebooks/ebbasicissues2.htm">Towards Social Renewal &ndash;
Basic Issues of the Social Question</a> some kind of super-sensible
forces will be present. When we eat, when we prepare out food, when
we  make our clothing, it is all reality. Esthetics may be
symbolically present, but the actual clothing is the reality.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 13pt">When
we look at the second sector of the future social organism [the
rights sector], we don't a symbolism like the second stage, where the
political state constituted the totality, but we have what is valid
for one person being equally valid for the other. </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 13pt">And
the third sector will be neither symbol nor platitude, but a
spiritual/cultural reality. The spirit will possess the possibility
of really living within humanity. </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 13pt">The
inner social order can only be built through a transition to inner
truthfulness. In the age of platitudes this will be especially
difficult though. For during the age of platitudes people acquire a
certain ingenious cleverness, which is, however, nothing more than a
play on words of the old concepts. Just consider for  a moment a
characteristic example. Suddenly from the imperialism of platitudes
comes the idea that it would be good if the queen of England also has
the title &ldquo;Empress of India&rdquo;. One can invent the most
beautiful reasons for this, but if it didn't happen, nothing would
have changed. The Emperor of Austria, who now belongs to the deposed
royalty, before he was chased out carried around along with his other
titles a most unusual one:  Franz Joseph I, Emperor of Austria,
Apostolic King of Hungary, King of Bohemia, Dalmatia, Croatia,
Slovenia, Galizia, Lodomeria, Illyia and so on.  Among all these
titles was also &ldquo;King of Jerusalem&rdquo;! The Austrian Emperor
also carried, until he was no longer emperor, the title &ldquo;King
of Jerusalem&rdquo;. It came from the crusades. It would be
impossible to give a better example of meaninglessness than this. And
such meaninglessness plays a much greater role than you imagine. It a
question of whether we can arise to a recognition of the present-day
platitudes. It is made difficult because those who live in platitudes
are the verbal representatives of the old concepts that stagger
around in their brains imitating thoughts. But one can only achieve
real thinking again when the inner soul-life is filled with substance
and that can only come from knowledge of the spiritual world, of
spiritual life. Only by being relieved by the spirit can one become a
complete person, after having been constipated with platitudes.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 13pt">What
I described yesterday as a feeling of shame will result in the call
for the spirit. And the propagation of the spirit will only be
possible if the spiritual/cultural sector is allowed to develop
independently. Otherwise we will always have to take advantage of
loopholes, as was the case with the Waldorf School because the
W&uuml;rttemberg Province education law had such a loophole which
made it possible to establish a Waldorf school only according
spiritual laws, according to spiritual principles, something which in
practically no only place on earth would be possible. But one can
only organize the things concerning the spiritual life from the
spirit itself if the other two sectors do not interfere, if
everything is taken directly from the spiritual sector itself. </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 13pt">At
present the tendency is the reverse. But this tendency does not
reckon with the fact that with every new generation a new
spiritual/cultural life appears on earth. It's immaterial whether a
dictatorship or a republic is established, if it is not understood
that everything which appears is subject to life and must be
continuously transformed, must pass through death and be formed anew,
pass through metamorphoses, then all that will be accomplished is
that every new generation will be revolutionary. Because only what is
considered good for the present will be established. A fundamental
concept for the western areas which are so mired in platitudes must
be to see the social organism as something living. And one sees it as
living only when it is considered in its threefold nature. It is just
those whose favorable economic position allows them to spread an
[economic] imperialism over practically the whole world who have the
terrible responsibility of recognizing that the cultivation of a true
spiritual life must be poured into this imperialism. It is ironic
that an economic empire which spread over the whole world was founded
on the British Isles and then when they were seeking mystical
spirituality turned to those whom they had economically conquered and
exploited. [India &ndash; Tr.] The obligation exists to allow one's
own spiritual substance to flow into the social organism. </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 13pt">That
is the awareness which our British friends should take with them,
that now, in this worldwide important historic moment, in all the
world's economic institutions where English is spoken, the
responsibility exists to introduce true spirituality into the
exterior economic empire. It's an either/or situation: Either efforts
remain exclusively oriented towards the economy &ndash; in which case
the fall of earthly civilization is the inevitable result &ndash; or
spirit will be poured into this economic empire, in which case what
was intended for earthly evolution will be achieved. I would like to
say: Every morning we should bear this in mind very seriously and all
activities should be organized  according to this impulse. The bell
tolls with extreme urgency at present &ndash; with terrible urgency.
In a certain sense we have reached the climax of platitudes. In an
age when all content has been squeezed out of platitudes, content
which came to humanity previously but which no longer has any
meaning, we must absorb real substantial content into our
psychological and social life. We must be clear about the fact that
this either/or must be decided by each individual for him or her self
and that each must participate in this decision with his most inner
force of soul. Otherwise he does not participate in the affairs of
humanity.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 13pt">But
the attraction for illusion is especially strong in the age of
platitudes. We wish so to sweep away the seriousness of life. We
avoid looking at the truth inherent in our evolution. How could
people let themselves be deceived by Wilsonian ideas if they really
had the intense desire for truthful clarity? It must come. The desire
for truth must grow in humanity. Above all, the desire for  the
liberation of spiritual/cultural life must grow along with the
knowledge that nobody has the right to call himself a Christian who
has not grasped the saying: &ldquo;My kingdom is not of this world.&rdquo;

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 13pt">This
means that the kingdom of Christ must become an invisible kingdom, a
truly invisible empire, an empire of which one speaks as of invisible
things. Only when spiritual science gains in importance will people
speak of this empire. Not some church, not some state, not some
economic empire can create this empire. Only the will of the
individual who lives in a liberated spiritual/cultural life can
create this empire.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 13pt">It
is difficult to believe that in the lands in which people are
downtrodden much can be done to free spiritual life. Therefore it
must be done in those lands where the people are not downtrodden
politically, economically and, obviously, not spiritually
downtrodden. Above all it must be realized that we have not arrived
at the day when we say: Until now things have gone downhill, they
will  go uphill again! No, if people do not act for this objective
out of the spirit, things will not go uphill again, but will continue
downhill. Humanity does not live today from what it has produced &ndash;
for to produce again a spiritual impulse is necessary &ndash;
humanity lives today from reserves, from old reserves, and they are
being used up. And it is childish and na&iuml;ve to think that a low
point is reached some day and things will get better then, even with
our hands in our laps. That's not how it is. And I would like to see
that the words spoken here kindle a fire in the hearts of those who
belong to the anthroposophical movement. I would hope that the
specter which perhaps haunts  those who find their way to this
anthroposophical movement be overcome by the spirit meant here. It is
certainly true that someone who finds his way to such a movement
often seeks something for himself, for his soul. Of course he can
have that, but only in order to stand with his soul in the service of
the whole. He should advance, certainly, for himself, but only so
mankind can advance through him. I cannot say that often enough. It
should be added to those things I said should be thought about every
morning. </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 13pt">If
we had really taken the inner impulse of this movement seriously, we
would have been much farther along. But perhaps what is done in our
circles does not help advance towards the future, but is often a
hindrance. We should ask ourselves why this is so. It is very
important. And above all we should not think that the sharpest powers
of opposition are not active from all sides against what strives for
the well-being of humanity.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 13pt">I
have already indicated to you what is being done in the world in
opposition to our movement, what hostility is activated against us. I
feel myself obliged to make these things known to you, so that you
should never say to yourself: We have already refuted this or that.
We have refuted nothing, because these opponents are not interested
in the truth. They prefer to ignore as much as possible the facts and
simply aim slanderous accusations from all corners.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 13pt">I
would like to read part of a letter to you which arrived recently
from Oslo. &ldquo;One of our anthroposophical friends works in a
so-called people's college in Oslo together with  a certain Shirmer.
This Mr Shirmer is in a certain sense quite a proficient teacher, but
is also a fanatical racist and a sworn anti-Semite. At a people's
meeting where three of us gave lectures about the Threefold Society,
he talked against us, or rather against Dr. Steiner's <a href="https://southerncrossreview.org/Ebooks/ebbasicissues2.htm">Towards Social
Renewal</a>, although without much success. The guy has a certain
influence in teachers' circles  and he works in his own way in the
sense of the social triformation in the school insofar as he is for
freedom, but on the other hand he works against the social
triformation and Dr Steiner for the  simple reason that he suspects
that Dr Steiner is a Jew. That is perhaps not so bad. We must expect
and overcome more serious opposition. But now he has received
confirmation of his suspicion. He turned to an &ldquo;authority&rdquo;,
namely the editor of the political anthropological monthly,
Berlin-Steglitz. This purely anti-Semitic magazine wrote to him that
Dr. Steiner is a Jew through and through. He is associated with the
Zionists. And the editor added that they, the anti-Semites, have had
their eye on you [Dr Steiner] for a long time. Mr Schirmer also says
that a persecution of the Jews is beginning now in Germany, and that
all the Jews on the anti-Semites' blacklist should be simply shot
down or, as they say, rendered harmless.&rdquo; and so on. </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 13pt">You
see, this has nothing to do with antisemitism as such, that's only on
the face of it. They choose  slogans in these situations, with which
they try to accomplish as much as possible with people who listen to
slogans. But such things clearly indicate what most people don't want
to see, what they want to ignore more and more. It is today much more
serious that you think, and we should not ignore the seriousness of
the times, but should realize that we are only at the beginning of
these things which are opposed to everything that is intended to
advance human progress.  And that we should never, without neglecting
our responsibilities,  divert our attention from what is a radical
evil within humanity, what manifests as a radical evil within
humanity. The worst that  can happen today is paying attention to
mere slogans and platitudes, and believing that outdated concepts
somehow have roots in human reality today &ndash; if we do not
initiate a new reality from the sources of the spirit itself.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 13pt">That,
my dear friends, was what I wanted to tell you today, first of all to
all of you, but especially to those whose visit has pleased us
greatly &ndash; especially to our English friends, so that when they
return to their own country,  where it will be so important, they
will have  something on which to base their activities. You will have
seen that I have not spoken in favor or against anyone, nor have I
flattered anyone. I only speak here in order to say the truth. I have
known theosophists who when they speak to members of a foreign nation
begin to talk about what an honor it is to be able to spread the
teachings about the spiritual life in a nation which has accumulated
so much glory.  Such things cannot be said to you here. But I believe
that you have come here to hear the truth and I think that I have
best served you by really trying to tell the unvarnished truth. You
will have learned during your trip that telling the truth nowadays is
not a comfortable thing, for the truth calls forth opposition now
more than ever. Do not be afraid of opposition, for they are one and
the same: to have enemies and to tell the truth. And we will
understand each other best when  our mutual understanding is based on
the desire to hear the unvarnished truth.</FONT></P>
