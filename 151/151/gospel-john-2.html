<p class="intro">When a subject such as our present one is discussed from the
standpoint of spiritual science, this is not done by basing the facts
upon some document or other exposition come into being in the course of
human development, and by then illuminating the facts in question on the
authority of such a document. That is not the way of spiritual science.
On the contrary, entirely independent of all documents, spiritual
science investigates what has occurred in human evolution; and only then
— after the spiritual scientist has completed his research by means
independent of any documents, and knows how to describe what he has
found — only then is the document in question examined with a view of
discovering whether it agrees with what had first been disclosed without
reference to any tradition whatever. So all the statements made in these
lectures concerning the course of this or that event are by no means to
be taken as merely deriving from the Bible, from one of the four
Gospels, but rather as the conclusions arrived at by spiritual research
independent of the Gospels. But no opportunity will be missed to show
that everything the spiritual scientist can fathom and observe is to be
found in the Gospels, particularly in the Gospel of John.</p>
<p>We have a curious utterance by the great mystic Jacob Boehme which
puzzles all who are not in touch with spiritual science. Jacob Boehme
once drew attention to his way of discussing past epochs in human
evolution — say, the figure of Adam — as though they had been within the
scope of his own experiences, and he said: “Many might ask, Were you
then present when Adam walked the earth?” And Jacob Boehme answers
unequivocally: “Yes, I was present.” Now, that is a noteworthy
statement; for spiritual science is actually in a position to observe
with the eyes of the spirit whatever has occurred, be it ever so far
back; and in these introductory remarks I should like to touch briefly
upon the reason for this.</p>
<p>Everything that happens in the physical sensory world has, of course,
its counterpart in the spiritual world. When a hand moves there is
present not only what your eye sees as a moving hand, but behind this
moving hand, this visible image of the hand, there are, for example, my
thought and my will: the hand is to move. In short, a spiritual element
underlies it all. But while the visible image, the sense impression of
the hand motion, passes, its spiritual counterpart remains inscribed in
the spiritual world and always leaves a trace; so if our spiritual eyes
are opened we can trace all things that have happened in the world by
the imprints left by their spiritual counterparts. Nothing can occur in
the world without leaving such traces.</p>
<p>Suppose the spiritual scientist gazes back to Charlemagne, or to the
time of Rome, or to Greek antiquity: everything that took place there
has been preserved in the spiritual world as imprints of its spiritual
prototypes, and can be seen there. This seeing is called reading the
<em>akashic record</em>. There exists this living script which the
spiritual eye can see; and when the spiritual scientist describes the
events of Palestine or the observation of Zarathustra he is not
describing what is found in the Bible or in the Gathas, but what he
himself is able to read in the <em>akashic record</em>. Only then does
he investigate whether the disclosures of the <em>akashic record</em>
are to be found in the documents as well — in our case, the Gospels.</p>
<p>The attitude, therefore, of spiritual research toward documents is
wholly unhampered; and for this very reason spiritual research will be
the true judge of what documents have to tell. But when we find the same
information in the documents as we were able to glean from the
<em>akashic record</em> we infer first, that the documents are true, and
second, that someone must have written them who was also able to read in
the <em>akashic record</em>. Many religious and other documents of the
human race are retrieved by spiritual science in this way. — What has
just been said shall now be clarified by the study of a special chapter
in human evolution, the Gospel of John, and its relation to the other
Gospels. But you must not imagine that the <em>akashic record</em>, the
spiritual history which lies open like a book before the seer's eye,
resembles any script of the ordinary world. It is a living kind of
script, and we will try to understand this through what is to
follow.</p>
<p>Suppose the seer gazes back in time — say, to the time of Caesar.
Caesar did certain deeds, and in so far as they occurred on the physical
plane his contemporaries witnessed them. But they all left their traces
in the <em>akashic record</em>; and when the seer looks back he sees
them as spiritual shadow-pictures or prototypes. — Call to mind again
the movement of the hand: as a seer you do not perceive the picture this
presents to the eye, but you will always see the intention to move the
hand, the invisible forces that move it. In the same way is to be seen
everything that went on in Caesar's thoughts, be it certain steps he
intended to take or some battle he planned. Everything seen by his
contemporaries originated in the impulses of his will and was executed
by the invisible forces underlying the sense images. But the latter
really appear in the <em>akashic record</em> as the Caesar who moved and
had his being, as the spiritual image of Caesar.</p>
<p>Here someone inexperienced in such matters might object: Your tales
are nothing but day-dreams — you know from your history what Caesar did,
and now your mighty imagination makes you believe you are seeing all
sorts of invisible <em>akashic pictures</em>. — But those who have
experience in these things know that the less familiar one is with such
events through outer history, the easier it is to read in the
<em>akashic record</em>; for outer history and a knowledge of it are
actually confusing for the seer. When we have reached a certain age we
are hampered by various aspects of our education connected with the age
in which we live. In the same way the seer, equipped with the education
provided by his epoch, arrives at the point when he can give birth to
his clairvoyant “I”. He has studied history; he has learned how things
are handed down in geology, biology, archaeology, and the history of
culture. All this actually interferes with his vision and may bias him
in his reading of the <em>akashic record</em>; for in outer history one
can by no means expect to find the same objectivity and certainty that
are to be achieved in deciphering the <em>akashic record</em>.</p>
<p>Consider for a moment what it is that causes this or that event to
become what is called history: it may be that certain documents have
been preserved relating to some events, while others — and perhaps the
most important ones — have been lost. An example will show how
unreliable all history can be. Among a number of poems Goethe had
planned but did not finish — and for the deeper student these constitute
a beautiful supplement to the great and glorious finished works he left
us — there is the fragment of a poem on <em>Nausicaa</em>. There exist
only a few sketches in which Goethe had noted how he intended to deal
with this poem. He often worked that way, jotting down a few sentences
of which frequently but little is preserved. That was the case with the
<em>Nausicaa</em>. Now, there were two men who endeavored to complete
this work, both of them researchers: Scherer, the literary historian,
and Herman Grimm. But Herman Grimm was not only a researcher but an
imaginative thinker — the man who wrote <em>The Life of
Michelangelo</em> and the <em>Goethe</em>. Herman Grimm went about the
task by trying to find his way into Goethe's spirit, and he asked
himself: Goethe being what he was, how would he have conceived of a
figure like the <em>Nausicaa</em> of the Odyssey? — Whereupon, with a
certain disregard of that historical document, he created a Nausicaa in
the spirit of Goethe. Scherer on the other hand, who always sought what
was to be found among the documents in black and white, argued that a
Nausicaa begun by Goethe must be completed purely on the basis of the
material available; and he, too, tried to construct a <em>Nausicaa</em>,
but exclusively out of what these scraps of paper had to offer. Of this
procedure Herman Grimm remarked: What if Goethe's servant used some of
these scraps of paper — perhaps just the ones containing something very
important — for Iighting the fire? Have we any guarantee that the
surviving scraps of paper are of any value at all compared with those
that may have been used for lighting the fire?</p>
<p>All history based on documents may be analogous to this illustration,
and indeed it often is. When building on documents we must never lose
sight of the possibility that just the most important ones may have
perished. Indeed, what passes for history is nothing more nor less than
a <em>fable convenue</em>. But when the seer is hampered by this
convention and at the same time sees everything quite differently in the
<em>akashic</em> record, it is difficult for him to have faith in the
<em>akashic</em> picture; and the public will voice its resentment when
he tells a different story out of the <em>akashic record</em>. Hence one
who is experienced in these things likes best to speak of ancient times
of which there exist no documents, of the remote stages in the evolution
of our earth. There are no documents relating to those epochs; and that
is where the <em>akashic record</em> reports most faithfully, because
the seer is not confused by outer history. — You will be able to gather
from these remarks that it could never occur to anyone familiar with
these matters that the pictures provided by the <em>akashic record</em>
might be an echo of what is already known to him from outer history.</p>
<p>If we now search the <em>akashic record</em> for the great event to
which we alluded yesterday, we find the following salient points. The
whole human race, in as far as it lives on the earth, is descended from
a divine realm, from a divine-spiritual existence. It can be stated that
before any possibility existed for a physical eye to see human bodies,
for a hand to touch human bodies, man was present as a spiritual being;
and in the earliest ages he existed as a part of the divine-spiritual
beings: the Gods are the ancestors of men, so to speak, and men the
descendants of the Gods. The Gods had need of men as their issue,
because without them they would have been unable to descend, as it were,
into the sensory physical world. In that remote time the Gods had their
being in other worlds, acting from without upon man who gradually
evolved upon the earth.</p>
<p>And now men had to overcome, step by step, the obstacles placed in
their path by their earth life. What is the nature of these obstacles?
The aspect of evolution essential for mankind was the need for the Gods
to remain spiritual, while humans, as their descendants, became
physical. All the obstacles presented specifically by physical existence
had to be surmounted by man, who possessed spirit only as the inner
phase of the physical, and who as an outer being had become physical. It
was within the confines of material existence that he had to develop;
and it was in this way that he progressed upward step by step, steadily
maturing until he should become increasingly able to turn to the Gods in
whom he had his genesis. A descent from the Gods, and then a turning
back to them, in order to reach and re-unite with them, that is man's
path through life on earth. But if this evolution was to come about,
certain human individualities always had to develop more rapidly than
the rest, to hurry on ahead in order to become their leaders and
teachers. Such people, then, have their being in humanity's midst and
find their way back to the Gods, as it were, in advance of others. We
can picture it in this way: In a given epoch men have attained to a
certain degree of maturity in their development. They may have the
premonition of a return to the Gods, but they have a long way to go
before achieving it. Every person has within him a spark of the divine,
but in the leaders it is always brighter: they are closer to that divine
principle to which man must ultimately attain again. And this that
dwells in the leaders of mankind is perceived by those whose eyes have
been opened to the spirit as their essence and chief attribute.</p>
<p>Let us suppose some great leader of mankind confronted another
person, not his equal but above the average. The latter feels vividly
that the other is a great leader, permeated to a high degree by the
spirituality to which other people must eventually attain. How would
such a man describe this leader? He might say: Before me stands a man, a
man in a physical body like everyone else; but his physical body is
negligible, it need not be taken into account. When, however, I observe
him with the eye of the spirit, I see united with him a mighty spiritual
being, a divine-spiritual being which predominates to such an extent
that my whole attention is focused on it — not on what appears as body
which he has in common with others.</p>
<p>To spiritual sight, then, there appears in a leader of mankind
something which in its nature towers above the rest of humanity, and
which must be described in quite a different way: the description must
be of what the spiritual eye sees. Nowadays public men whose word is law
would undoubtedly be amused at the idea of such surpassing leaders of
mankind: we already have the spectacle of various erudite scientists
regarding the shining lights of humanity as psychiatric cases. Such a
leader would only be recognized as such by those whose spiritual vision
had been sharpened; but these would indeed know that he was neither a
fool nor a visionary, nor simply a very gifted person, as the more
benevolent might designate him, but rather that he was among the
greatest figures of human life in the spiritual sense.</p>
<p>That is the way it would be today; but in the past it was a different
matter, even in the none too remote past. Human consciousness, as we
know, has undergone various metamorphoses, and formerly all people were
endowed with a dim, shadowy clairvoyance. Even at the time when Christ
lived on earth clairvoyance was still developed to a certain degree, and
in earlier centuries even more so, though it was but a shadow of the
clairvoyance common in the Atlantean and the first post-Atlantean
epochs. It disappeared only gradually. But a few isolated individuals
still had it, and even today there are natural clairvoyants whose dim
higher vision enables them to distinguish the spiritual nature of
men.</p>
<p>Let us turn to the time in which Buddha appeared to the ancient
Indian people. Conditions were very different at that time. Today the
appearance of a Buddha, especially in Europe, would arouse no particular
respect. But in those old days it was a different matter, for there were
very many who could discern the true nature of the event, namely, that
this Buddha birth meant a great deal more than does an ordinary birth.
In oriental writings, especially in those treating the subject with the
deepest understanding, the birth of Buddha is described in the grand
manner, as one might put it. It is related that Queen Maya was “the
image of the Great Mother”, and that it was foretold she would bring a
mighty being into the world. This being was then born prematurely — a
very common means of launching an outstanding being in the world,
because thereby the human being in which the higher spiritual being is
to incarnate is less closely amalgamated with matter than when the child
is carried the full time of gestation. It is then further related in the
notable records of the Orient that at the moment of birth Buddha was
enlightened, that he opened his eyes at once and directed his gaze to
the four points of the compass, to the north, south, east, and west. We
are told that he then took seven steps, and that the marks of these
steps are engraved in the ground he trod. It is further recorded that he
spoke at once, and the words he spoke were these: “This is the life in
which I shall rise from Bodhisattva to Buddha, the last incarnation I
shall have to pass through on this earth!”</p>
<p>Strange as such a communication may appear to the
materialistic-minded person of today, and impossible as it is to
interpret offhand from a materialistic viewpoint, it is nevertheless the
truth for one who is able to see things with the eye of the spirit; and
at that time there still existed people who, by means of natural
clairvoyance, could discern spiritually what it was that was born with
Buddha. Those are strange excerpts I have quoted from the oriental
writings: nowadays they are called legends and myths. But he who
understands these things knows that something of spiritual truth is
hidden therein; and events such as the Buddha birth have significance
not only for the intimate circle of the personality in question but for
the world as well, for they radiate spiritual forces, as it were. And
those who lived at a time when the world was more receptive to spiritual
forces perceived that at the birth of Buddha spiritual forces actually
rayed forth.</p>
<p>It would be a trivial question to ask: Why does that sort of thing
not still occur today? As a matter of fact, it does happen; only it
requires a seer to perceive it. It is not enough that there should be
one to radiate these forces: there must also be someone there to receive
them. When people were more spiritual than they are today they were also
more receptive to such radiations. So again a profound truth underlies
the story that healing and reconciling forces were at work when the
Buddha was born. It is not a legend but a report based on deep truths
which tells us that when Buddha came into the world, those who had
previously hated each other were now united in love, those who had
quarreled now met with expressions of mutual esteem, and so forth.</p>
<p>To one who surveys the development of mankind with the eye of the
seer this does not appear as it does to the historian — a level path, at
most overtopped a bit here and there by figures accepted as historical.
People will not admit that spiritual peaks and mountains exist — that is
more than they can bear. But the seer knows that there are lofty heights
and mountains towering above the path of the rest of mankind: these are
the leaders of humanity. Now, upon what is such leadership built? Upon
having gradually passed through the stages leading to life in the
spiritual world. One of these stages we pointed out yesterday as the
most important one: the birth of the higher I, the spiritual I; and we
said that this was preceded and followed by other stages. It is evident
that what we designate the Christ event is the mightiest peak in the
range of human evolution, and that a long preparation was indispensable
before the Christ Being could incarnate in Jesus of Nazareth.</p>
<p>In order to understand this preparation we must visualize the same
phenomenon on a smaller scale. Let us suppose a person starts on the
path to spiritual cognition in any one of his incarnations — that is, he
carries out some of the exercises (to be described later) which render
the soul more and more spiritual, more receptive to what is spiritual,
and guide it toward the moment when it bears the higher, imperishable I
that can see into the spiritual world. Many experiences are passed
through before that moment arrives. One must not imagine that anything
pertaining to the spirit can be hurried: everything of the sort must be
absolved with patience and perseverance. Let us suppose, then, that
someone starts a training of this kind. His aim is the birth of the
higher I, but he only succeeds in reaching a certain preliminary stage.
Then he dies; and in due time he is born again. Here one of two things
can happen: either he can feel the urge to seek a teacher who will show
him how he can rapidly repeat what he had previously passed through and
attain to the higher stages, or else, for one reason or another, he does
not take this way. In the latter case, as well, the unfolding of his
life will often be different from that of the lives of others. The life
of one who has trodden the path of enlightenment at all will quite of
itself provide something resembling effects of the stage he had already
reached in his previous incarnation. He will have experiences of a
different nature, and the impression of these on him will be different
from that received by other people. Then he will attain anew, by means
of these experiences, to what he had previously achieved through his
efforts. In his former incarnation he had to strive actively from step
to step; but now that life brings him as a recurrence, so to speak, what
he had once acquired through effort, this approaches him from without,
as it were; and it may be that he will experience the results of his
previous incarnations in quite a different form.</p>
<p>Thus it may happen that even in his childhood some experience can
make upon his soul an impression of such a nature as to re-engender the
forces he had acquired in his previous life. Suppose such a person had
attained to a certain degree of wisdom in a given incarnation. He is
then born again as a child, like everyone else. But at the age of seven
or eight he has some painful experience, and the consequence is that all
the wisdom he had once acquired comes to the fore again: he is back at
the stage he had reached before, and thence can advance to the next one.
Now we will suppose further that he endeavors to proceed another few
steps, and dies again. In his next incarnation the same thing can happen
again: once more some outer experience can put him to the test, as it
were, again revealing first, what he had achieved in his next to the
last incarnation, and then, in his last one. And now he can climb
another step.</p>
<p>You will see from this that only by taking account of such events can
we understand the life of one who had already passed through certain
stages of development. There is one stage, for instance, that is soon
reached by serious striving along the path of enlightenment: the stage
of the so-called Wanderer, of him who has outgrown the prejudices of his
immediate surroundings and has cast off the fetters imposed by his
environment. This need not make him irreverent: we can become all the
more reverent; but he must be free of the prejudices of his immediate
surroundings. Let us assume that this person dies at a stage in which he
has already worked his way through to a modicum of freedom and
independence. When he is born again it can happen that comparatively
early in his life some experience will re-awaken this feeling of freedom
and independence in him. As a rule, this is the result of losing his
father or someone else to whom he is closely bound; or it might be a
consequence of his father's reprehensible behavior toward him — he might
have cast him out, or something of the sort. All this is faithfully
reported in the legends of the various peoples, for in matters of this
kind the folk myths and legends are really wiser than is modern science.
Among the legends you will often find the type in which the child is
cast out, is found by shepherds, nourished and brought up by them, and
later restored to his station (Chiron, Romulus and Remus). The fact that
their own home plays them false serves to re-awaken in them the fruits
of former incarnations. The legend of the casting out of Oedipus is in
this category, too. You will now understand that the more advanced a man
is — whether at the stage when his higher I is born or even farther —
the richer in experience his life must be if he is to be capable of a
new experience, one he had not yet had.</p>
<p>He who was destined to embody in himself the mighty being we call the
Christ could naturally not assume this mission at any random age: he had
first to mature very gradually. No ordinary man could undertake this
mission: it had to be one who in the course of many lives had attained
to lofty degrees of initiation. What was here demanded is faithfully
told us in the <em>akashic record</em>. This relates how a certain
individuality had striven upward throughout many lives step by step to
high degrees of initiation. Then this individuality was born again, and
in this earthly embodiment passed first through preparatory experiences.
But in this embodiment there lived an individuality who had already
passed through high stages of initiation, an initiate destined in a
later period of his life to receive into himself the Individuality of
the Christ. And the first experiences of this initiate are repetitions
of his former degrees of initiation, whereby all the previous
achievements of his soul are re-evoked.</p>
<p>Now, we know that the human being consists of physical body, etheric
body, astral body, and I. But we also know that in the course of human
life only the physical body is born at physical birth, and that up to
the seventh year the etheric body is still enclosed in a sort of etheric
maternal sheath which is then discarded, at the time of the change of
teeth, in the same way as is the physical maternal sheath when the
physical body is born into the outer physical world. Similarly, at
puberty, an astral sheath is thrown off and the astral body is born. And
approximately in the twenty-first year the I is born, but again only
gradually.</p>
<p>Having considered the birth of the physical body, of the etheric body
in the seventh year, and of the astral body in the fourteenth or
fifteenth year, we must similarly take into account a birth of the
sentient soul, the comprehension or sensitivity soul, and the
consciousness soul; and the ages at which these births occur are
approximately the twenty-first, the twenty-eighth, and the thirty-fifth
year respectively. From this it is evident that the Christ Being could
not incarnate in a man of this earth, could not find room in such a man
before the comprehension soul was completely born: the Christ Being
could not embody in the initiate into whom He was born before this
initiate had reached his twenty-eighth year. Spiritual science confirms
this. It was between the twenty-eighth and thirty-fifth years that the
Christ Being entered the individuality who walked the earth as a great
initiate, and who gradually, in the light and radiance of this great
Being, unfolded all that otherwise man develops without this radiance,
this light; namely, the etheric body, the astral body, the sentient
soul, and the comprehension soul. Thus we can say that up to this age we
see before us in him who was called to be the Christ bearer a lofty
initiate who gradually passed through the experiences that finally
evoked all he had undergone in previous incarnations — the sum of his
conquests in the spiritual world. Only then could he say, Now I am here;
now will I sacrifice all that I have. I no longer desire an independent
I, but will make of myself the bearer of the Christ: henceforth He shall
dwell in me, shall fill me completely.</p>
<p>All four Gospels stress this moment when the Christ incorporated in a
personality of this earth. However much they may differ in other
respects, they all point to this event of the Christ entering into the
great initiate: the baptism by John. In that moment, so clearly defined
by the author of the John Gospel when he says that the Spirit descended
in the form of a dove and united with Jesus of Nazareth, in that moment
occurred the birth of Christ: as a new and higher I the Christ is born
in the soul of Jesus of Nazareth. And the other ego, that of a great
initiate, had now attained to the lofty plane on which it was ripe for
this event.</p>
<p>And who was it that was to be born in the being of Jesus of Nazareth?
This was indicated yesterday: the God Who was there from the beginning,
who had remained in the spiritual world, so to speak, leaving mankind to
its evolution. He it was who descended and incarnated in Jesus of
Nazareth. Can we find this indicated by the writer of the John Gospel?
We need only take the words of the Gospel very seriously; and with this
in mind let us read the beginning of the Old Testament:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In the</em> (primordial) <em>beginning God created the heaven and
the earth. And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was
upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of
the waters.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let us visualize the situation: <em>The Spirit of God moved upon the
face of the waters</em>. Below, the earth with its kingdoms as the issue
of the divine Spirit; and among these one individual evolves to the
point of being able to take into himself this Spirit that moved upon the
face of the waters. What does the author of the John Gospel say? He
tells us that John the Baptist recognized the being spoken of in the Old
Testament. He says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode
upon him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He knew that upon whomsoever the Spirit should descend was He that
was to come: the Christ. There you have the beginning of world
evolution: the Spirit moving upon the face of the waters; and there you
have John who baptized with water, and the Spirit that in the beginning
moved upon the face of the waters and now descends into the
individuality of Jesus of Nazareth. It would be impossible to connect in
a more grandiose way the event of Palestine with that other event, told
at the beginning of the same document whose continuation is the
Gospel.</p>
<p>But in other ways as well we find the John Gospel linked with this
oldest of documents. The writer effects this by pointing out that with
Jesus of Nazareth is merged the same principle that from the beginning
worked creatively at all earth evolution. We know that the opening words
of the Gospel of St. John read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the beginning was the Word (or Logos), and the Word (or Logos) was
with God, and a God was the Word (or Logos).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is this Logos, and in what sense was it with God? Let us turn to
the beginning of the Old Testament, to the passage presenting this
Spirit of whom it is written:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. And the
divine Spirit said, Let there be light: and there was light.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let us keep that in mind and express it somewhat differently; let us
listen to the divine Spirit intoning the creative Word through the
world. What is this Word? In the beginning was the <em>Logos</em>, and
the divine Spirit called out, and what the Spirit called out came to
pass. That means that in the Word there was life; for had there been no
life in it, nothing could have come to pass. And what was it that came
to pass? We are told:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Turn back here to the John Gospel:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and a God
was the Word.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now the Word had streamed into matter, where it became the outer form
of the Godhead.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In it was life; and the life was the light of men.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this way the author links his Gospel to that oldest of documents,
the <em>Book of Genesis</em>. He refers to the same divine Spirit, only
in different words. Then he makes it clear that this is the divine
Spirit Who appears in Jesus of Nazareth. All four Evangelists agree that
with the Baptism by John the Christ was born in Jesus of Nazareth, and
that for the consummation of this event Jesus of Nazareth had needed
comprehensive preparation. We must understand that everything previously
told us concerning the life of Jesus of Nazareth is nothing but the sum
of experiences portraying his ascent into the higher worlds during
previous incarnations: the gradual preparation of everything embraced in
his astral body, etheric body, and physical body for the eventual
reception of the Christ.</p>
<p>The Evangelist who wrote the Gospel of Luke even says that Jesus of
Nazareth had prepared himself in every respect for this great event, the
birth of Christ in him. The individual experiences that led him upward
to the Christ event will be discussed tomorrow. Today I shall merely
point out that the author of the Luke Gospel told us in a single
sentence that he who received the Christ into himself had indeed
prepared himself in the previous years: that his astral body had
achieved the virtue, nobility and wisdom indispensable for the birth of
the Christ in him; and furthermore, that he had brought his etheric body
to such a degree of maturity, and had developed such pliancy and beauty
in his physical body, that the Christ could dwell in him. — One need
only understand the Gospel aright. Take the second Chapter of Luke,
verse 52. True, the wording of this verse in most of the Bible
translations will not tell you what I just said. There it says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And Jesus increased in wisdom and age, and in favor with God and
man.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It would still make sense if such a man as the writer of the Luke
Gospel had related of Jesus of Nazareth that he increased in wisdom; but
when he reports as a solemn fact that he increased in age — well, that
is not clear on its face, for it is a circumstance calling for no
special emphasis. That it is nevertheless mentioned suggests that
something more must be involved. Let us examine the verse in question in
the original text:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kai Jesous proekopten en to Sophia, kai helekia kai chariti Para theo
kai anthropois.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a matter of fact, here is what this means: “He increased in
wisdom” signifies that he developed his astral body; and anyone who
knows what the Greek mind associated with the word <em>helekia</em> can
tell you that the term refers to the development of the etheric body,
whereby wisdom gradually becomes skill. As you know, the astral body
develops the qualities called upon for individual occasions: we
understand something once and for all. The etheric body, on the other
hand, shapes what it develops into habits, inclinations, and
capabilities. This occurs by means of constant repetition. Wisdom
becomes a habit: it is practiced because it has become second nature. So
what this "increase in age" means is an increase in maturity: just as
the astral body has grown in wisdom, so the etheric body has increased
in pure habits in the realm of goodness, nobility, and beauty. And the
third quality that increased in Jesus of Nazareth, charis, really means
that which manifests itself and becomes visible as beauty. No other
translations are right. In translating this verse we must indicate that
Jesus gained in gracious beauty; in other words, that his physical body,
too, grew in beauty and nobility.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And Jesus increased in wisdom (in his astral body), in maturity of
disposition (in his etheric body), and in gracious beauty (in his
physical body), in a way manifest to God and man.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There you have the delineation given by Luke. Clearly, he knew that
he who was to receive the Christ into himself had first to develop the
threefold sheath — physical body, etheric body, and astral body — to its
highest capacity.</p>
<p>In this way we shall learn how one can rediscover in the Gospels what
spiritual science tells us independent of them. For this reason
spiritual science constitutes a cultural current capable of recapturing
the religious documents; and this recapture will not remain a mere
milestone in human knowledge and cognition, but will stand as a conquest
of soul and mind in the realm of feeling and sentience. And that is
precisely the sort of understanding we need if we are to grasp the
intervention of the Christ in the evolution of humanity.</p>
