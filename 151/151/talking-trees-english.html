<p class="intro"><em>Nicolás</em> lives in a small town in the north of the country.
The house he lives in is on the outskirts of the town near a forest.
When Nicolás looks out of his bedroom window he sees the forest. It has
been there as long as he can remember. In fact, it is one of the first
things he ever saw, after his mother of course. When he was a baby she
used to hold him up so he could look out the window at the forest.</p>
<p>When Nicolás <span id="anchor"></span>was old enough to walk he went
with his mother into the forest along a footpath, but only as far as the
Talking Tree. The tree didn't talk to him then, naturally, because he
wouldn't have understood. It was the tallest and thickest tree around
and his mother told him it was an oak.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">*</p>
<p><em>Alma</em> lives in another small town in the north of the
country. The house she lives in is on the outskirts of the town on the
other side of the same forest. When Alma looks out her bedroom window
she sees the forest. It has been there as long as she can remember. In
fact, it is one of the first things she ever saw, after her father of
course. When she was a baby he used to hold her up so she could look out
the window at the forest.</p>
<p>When Alma was old enough to walk she went with her father into the
forest along a footpath, but only as far as another Talking Tree. The
tree didn't talk to her then, naturally, because she wouldn't have
understood. It was the tallest and thickest tree around and Alma's
father told her it was an oak.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">*</p>
<p>One fine spring day when he was older, Nico – as his friends called
him – walked to the oak-tree after lunch; it was about three miles and
he knew the way well. He sat down within the curve of a fat oak-root and
opened a book to read. He had only read a few pages when he heard a
strange voice: <em>Is the book interesting?</em></p>
<p>It seemed to come from above. He jumped up and looked up into the
tree, thinking that someone was sitting or standing on a branch. But he
saw no one.</p>
<p>Yes, it is, he said. Where are you? He looked all around, even behind
the tree, but still saw no one.</p>
<p><em>What is the book's title</em>? the voice asked. It was like a
whisper, but clear and flowing.</p>
<p>The Magic Mound<em>.</em> Do you know it?</p>
<p>No, we have heard of The Magic Mountain, but that is something else,
quite old.</p>
<p>Where are you? Nico repeated, tired of the joke.</p>
<p><em>You were sitting on us</em>. Nico looked down at the roots.
<em>Now you are looking at our roots.</em></p>
<p>Nico's eyes opened wide: Are you the tree?</p>
<p>You have said it.</p>
<p>But trees can't talk.</p>
<p>Usually we do not, but we can if we wish, as long as there is a
little wind.</p>
<p>Nico noticed that the tree's whispered voice sounded like wind coming
from the treetop.</p>
<p><em>Even when we do talk to people they do not hear us</em>, <em>so
we don't bother</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">*</p>
<p>On the other side of the forest Alma had also begun to read <em>The
Magic Mound</em> when she was interrupted by the other oak-tree. When
the tree said that people don't listen when they talk, she said,
<em>I</em> hear you.</p>
<p><em>We knew you would</em>, the tree replied. <em>What would you like
to know?</em></p>
<p>Alma thought a while, then said, How old are you?</p>
<p>We do not remember exactly, a few hundred years perhaps.</p>
<p>Wow! That's awesome!</p>
<p>The tree seemed pleased at first, but then Alma heard what sounded
like a sigh: <em>We do not think we will last much longer
though.</em></p>
<p>Well, you are quite old, Alma said.</p>
<p><em>Not for an oak. We could live much longer</em>.</p>
<p>Oh, sorry. Are you sick then? Alma asked. You look fine to me … only
kind of sad.</p>
<p>No, not sick at all, quite well, thank you.</p>
<p>Why are you sad then? Alma wanted to know.</p>
<p>Because soon they will cut us down.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">*</p>
<p>(illustration)</p>
<p>Oh, that's too bad, Nico commiserated when his tree said <em>Because
soon they will cut us down. </em>But you always say "we" and “us”. Will
they only cut <em>you</em> down, or other trees as well?</p>
<p>All the trees in this forest, including my Sister Tree on the other
side.</p>
<p>That's terrible, Nico said, but how do you know that?</p>
<p>Because we hear the men talking when they come with their strange
instruments and talk about how long it will take to cut us all down and
what they will do with our dead bodies, which they call wood.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">*</p>
<p><em>We do not mind when they cut a few of us down to make furniture
or houses or even kindling, </em>Alma's tree explained<em>. But to cut
down the whole forest is very bad – and not only for us.</em></p>
<p>Who else is it very bad for? Alma asked, worried.</p>
<p>For you too, and for all the animals and for the atmosphere, and,
well...</p>
<p>For everything! Alma exclaimed.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">*</p>
<p><em>We are all one</em>, Nico's tree explained. <em>All oaks in a
forest are one, as are all pines, all weeping willows, all plants and
all animals of every species.</em></p>
<p>But how do you communicate with each other? Nico asked.</p>
<p>We speak to each other with our roots.</p>
<p>So your roots are like underground cellphones.</p>
<p>Nico didn't stop to think about how extraordinary that was; instead
he asked, But why do they want to cut you all down?</p>
<p><em>They want to clear the land to sell it, then those who buy it
will plant things that make much money, like soy beans, or grazing land
for farting cows, </em>the tree explained<em>. Or they will build tall
buildings and charge rent or gated communities where the rich can safely
live.</em></p>
<p>Nico was so shocked that at first he could not think of anything to
say. Until something occurred to him. He asked, Why are you telling
<em>me</em> this, Tree?</p>
<p>The tree waited for a stiff breeze, then said, <em>Because you are
still a boy and can understand us with your heart.</em> It paused as the
breeze weakened, then continued when it blew again: <em>We have seen you
come here almost every day since you were old enough to walk; you are
still one of us.</em></p>
<p>Nico had never thought of himself as a tree, but he rather liked the
idea.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">*</p>
<p>On the other end of the forest Alma's tree waited for a stiff breeze,
then said, <em>Because you are still a girl and can understand us with
your heart. </em>It paused as the breeze weakened, then continued when
it blew again: <em>We have seen you come here almost every day since you
were old enough to walk; you are still one of us.</em></p>
<p>Alma had never thought of herself as a tree, but she rather liked the
idea.</p>
<p>How can I help you? she asked. And myself and all the animals and
plants and insects and...</p>
<p><em>We do not know, </em>the tree interrupted her, that is why we
are trees and not people. We see and we hear and we feel, but we cannot
think much beyond the moment.</p>
<p>And you can't move, Alma reminded the tree.</p>
<p>That was so obvious that the tree had no need to say anything.</p>
<p>So I would have to think of something myself.</p>
<p>The tree nodded in the breeze and said: <em>My Brother Tree is
talking to a boy right now.</em></p>
<p>Who is that boy? Alma asked, surprised. Do I know him?</p>
<p><em>I do not know. If you want to meet him, Alf will take you to
him.</em></p>
<p>Before Alma could ask who Alf was, a large owl flapping down close to
her head gave utterance to a long hiss, followed by a sharp clicking
sound, ending with a loud, laugh-like cry. She looked up, startled, and
saw it staring at her with piercing eyes from a low branch.</p>
<p><em>Follow Alf,</em> the tree said, almost like an order.</p>
<p>Alf spread its wings and flew deeper into the forest. After about
fifteen minutes it landed on the next oak and waited. Alma followed
walking, then running. It was easy because a path through the forest
seemed to open before her. But when she looked back there was no path
behind her.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">*</p>
<p>At the other end of the forest, Nico followed his owl, Ava, who
spread her wings and flew deeper into the forest and landed on the next
oak and waited. Nico followed walking, then running. It was easy because
a path through the forest seemed to open before him. But when he looked
back there was no path behind him.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">*</p>
<p>(illustration)</p>
<p>After what seemed a long time Alma's owl, Alf, called out hoo, hoo,
hoo, and Alma heard a similar call coming from a distance. Finally the
two owls, Alf and Ava, met, circled happily around each other and landed
on an old oak's lower branch.</p>
<p>Nico ran around a curve to not lose sight of Ali, then saw the two
owls seated on the oak's branch staring at him with their piercing eyes;
then they turned their heads and stared at Alma. Nico and Alma stopped
in their tracks.</p>
<p>Are you the boy who talks to Brother Tree? Alma asked the boy.</p>
<p>Yes, answered Nico. Are you the girl who talks to Sister Tree?</p>
<p>Yes, I am. Did your tree tell you about them being cut down?</p>
<p>Yes, she did. Do you think we can help them?</p>
<p>I don't know, Alma said, but I think we should try. After all, part
of us will be cut down too. And all the animals and plants who live in
this forest.</p>
<p>Nico thought about that for a while, then said, Yeah, that's right.
The deer and the foxes and the birds. I didn't think of that.</p>
<p>And the owls, Alma said, and Ali and Alf hoot, hooted together over
their heads.</p>
<p>But what can we do? Nico asked.</p>
<p>I'll ask my dad, Alma said.</p>
<p>And I'll ask my mom, Nico said.</p>
<p>Where can we meet afterward?</p>
<p>They both looked up at Ali and Alf sitting alongside each other on a
branch of the tree.</p>
<p>Can you bring us back here tomorrow? Alma asked them.</p>
<p>After you show us the way home now, Nico added.</p>
<p>The two owls clicked and hissed and flapped around and whistled three
times.</p>
<p>Does that mean we should whistle three times for you? Alma asked
them.</p>
<p>The owls nodded. They would have smiled if owls could smile.</p>
<p>(illustration)</p>
<p>We better go home now, Nico said, it'll be dark soon and our parents
will be worried.</p>
<p>They exchanged cellphone numbers and followed their respective owls
through the forest in opposite directions back to Sister Tree and
Brother Tree, from where they ran home.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">*</p>
<p>A talking tree? Nico's mother exclaimed...then she grinned: You gotta
be kidding.</p>
<p>No, mom, no kidding. I went into the forest up till that big old oak
we often visit. I sat down and opened a book to read. After a while the
tree asked me if the book was interesting.</p>
<p>But Nicolás, trees can't talk, you know that.</p>
<p>That's because we don't listen.</p>
<p>His mother smiled. That may be true, but who told you that?</p>
<p>The tree.</p>
<p>Now Nicolás, listen to me...</p>
<p>The voice seemed to come from above. I jumped up and looked up into
the tree, thinking that someone was sitting or standing on a branch. But
there was no one there. Then he asked me what the book's title was
and...</p>
<p>And Nico told his mom the whole rest of the story, just as I have
already described it to you here.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">*</p>
<p>A talking tree? Alma's father exclaimed...then he grinned: You gotta
be kidding.</p>
<p>After Alma told her dad her side of the story, which was essentially
the same as what Nico told his mom, her dad at first refused to believe
that a tree could talk and tell his daughter what she claimed it did.
<span id="anchor-1"></span>But he finally did agree with Alma that it
would be a cruel mistake to destroy the forest.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">*</p>
<p>Nico's mother, however, was not quite so sure that trees couldn't
talk. She called a friend who was a politician and asked him if he knew
anything about the forest being cut down. The politician hummed and
hawed, but when Nico's mom insisted, he admitted that the governor had
made a deal with certain real estate developers he couldn't name, who
would build luxury apartments or a soccer field or sell the land for
cattle grazing, which means thousands of farting cows, who are
responsible for global warming, although it's not their fault. The
developers would pay for clearing the forest of annoying trees and later
pay high taxes and something extra special for the governor.</p>
<p>Was it announced in the press? Nico's mother asked. I haven't heard
anything about it.</p>
<p>Well – and this is just between us – the governor wants to keep it
quiet until the work has actually started, which will be this week.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Oh, you know, to keep the tree-huggers and other bleeding hearts away
until it's too late for them to cause trouble.</p>
<p>Nico's mother thought a while, then said, I don´t like it, it's not
right to keep something important like this secret. In fact, it smells
pretty bad to me.</p>
<p>Well, this is the real world; you'll get over it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">*</p>
<p>Nico sent Alma a WhatsApp asking her to meet him in the forest asap.
When she answered he ran to Brother Tree and whistled three times.</p>
<p>Alf the owl came almost immediately when Alma whistled three times
and sat perched on Sister Tree's usual branch. She asked to be led to
where she and Nico had met the day before. When she arrived, Nico was
already there, waiting.</p>
<p>It's true, Nico told her. My mother talked to a politician, who
admitted it.</p>
<p>Of course it's true, Alma said. The trees said so, didn't they?</p>
<p>Yeah but, well, you know, this <em>confirms</em> it.</p>
<p>Okay, but what are we gonna do about it?</p>
<p>Nico thought a moment, then said, I don't know. What do you think we
could do?</p>
<p>How about if we climbed up the trees, Alma suggested. They wouldn't
cut them down if we were sitting in them, would they?</p>
<p>That sounds like a good idea, Nico said. I don't know if it will
work, but we could try.</p>
<p>Alma and Nico went back to their respective trees and asked if they
would allow the children to climb up on them. The trees nodded as though
shaken by a strong wind, although there was no wind at all. Then they
went to their schools and told their fellow students how they intended
to save the forest. Most of the students were enthusiastic and
volunteered to help by climbing trees. But the teachers in Alma's school
said they'd have to ask the director, who said she'd have to ask the
school inspector, who said she'd have to ask the Minister of
Education.</p>
<p>Finally Alma said <strong>Enough</strong>.By the time everyone
is asked and wants to ask someone else more important the trees will be
cut down. I'm going to climb right now without waiting for
permission.</p>
<p>Nico went to a Waldorf school which didn't have a director, so there
was no one to ask. Some teachers heard the talk but didn't take it
seriously, or didn't want to. Others liked the idea and eventually
became climbers, also known as tree-huggers, themselves.</p>
<p>The idea spread like wildfire when local newspapers and social media
on the internet expressed interest.</p>
<p>Alma and Nico climbed up their respective Brother and Sister Trees on
the day before the lumber company was scheduled to begin their cutting
spree. Their parents, who were opposed at first, finally climbed the
trees close to the ones their kids climbed. They said it was in order to
help save the trees, but we suspect it was also in order to keep an eye
on their strong-willed offspring.</p>
<p>Soon the forest was filled with trees having children, and some
adults, sitting up in their branches. There were many more trees than
people, so every tree couldn't have someone sitting in it, but there
were enough climbers to make cutting down all the trees impossible. Old
people who could no longer climb trees also came and sat at the bottom
of the trees on their roots, or just leaned against them. The police
arrested a few of them, but when a TV camera caught the cops dragging an
old woman by her hair, the governor screamed at the Chief of Police to
stop, to leave the forest and never go back – or he'd never be elected
again. The police left, but the governor wasn't reelected anyway.</p>
<p>Finally the whole state, then the whole country and finally the whole
world knew about the tree-hugger movement founded by Alma and Nico.
Certain politicians, who were paid by lumber companies and real estate
development companies, including the one owned by the President of the
Republic, fought with all their considerable power and money to force
the huggers down from the trees; but they refused to come down until the
deal between the government and the real estate companies was
canceled.</p>
<p>Alma and Nico are proud of having saved their forest, but they know
that many, many forests have already been destroyed, not only in their
own country, but in many other places in the world. They also know now
that the trees in the forests are living beings with their own kind of
intelligence and feeling; and that they are necessary for the survival
and well-being of the whole planet. Alma and Nico decided to dedicate
their lives to knowing and helping the trees, plants and animals of the
forests survive the greed and ignorance of humans.</p>
<p>We don't know yet if they will succeed.</p>
