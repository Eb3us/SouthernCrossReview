# To Cry for Beauty

![](fts.jpg){class="a"}

Have you ever seen a man, a solitary man\
cry for beauty?\
He sits there at the world\'s end,\
at life\'s end, and cries\
silently, tearlessly\
at the words in the book.\
Can the words in a book,\
be they ever so beautiful,\
make a man, a solitary man\
at the end of the world,\
at the end of life,\
tearlessly, soundlessly cry?\
It is not Mozart, nor Bach, nor even Piazzolla.\
For whom he cries.\
They are Words, logos, about two girls\
who met once and wrote their names\
in a notebook: *Esther* and *Nejma*.\
The man, the solitary man\
at the world\'s end, at life\'s end\
reads about their crossed lives\
and cries, and cries for Beauty.
