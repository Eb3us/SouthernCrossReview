# Mother Earth

## by Becky Hemsley

She's mountains and she's sunshine\
She's the moon, silvery bright\
She's the clouds and wind and rain\
And she's the dancing Northern Lights.

She is deserts and savannahs\
She's the waves that fill the sea\
She is birdsong and she's flowers\
She's the blossom on the trees.

And if you treat her fairly\
She will let the sun shine through\
She will kiss you with a gentle breeze\
And paint the sky in blue.

She'll rain if you are thirsty\
Then she'll blow the clouds away\
And she'll decorate with rainbows\
Whilst she calms the ocean waves.

But if you treat her badly\
She will breathe out stormy skies\
She will summon up tornadoes\
And antagonise the tides.

She'll throw things from the mountain\
In an avalanche of snow\
And she'll blaze and burn the forest\
So the trees no longer grow.

She'll treat you as you treat her\
So be careful what you choose\
For she's power you can't comprehend\
And much she stands to lose.

So treat her with the kindness\
And respect that she deserves\
See, if you rearrange her heart\
You'll see it holds the earth.
