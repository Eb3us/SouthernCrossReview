<p lang="en-US" align="JUSTIFY" style="page-break-inside: avoid; widows: 136">

</P>
<p align="JUSTIFY" style="page-break-inside: avoid; widows: 136"><font face="Calibri, sans-serif"><font size="4"><span lang="en-US">I
met Dr. Hableben during a working vacation in the <i>Traslasierra </i>valley<font size>,
which means, literally, Beyond-the-mountains. The mountain range in
question is just east of the Andes and about five hundred miles west
of Buenos Aires. So much for geography. I include it in order to
indicate that my encounter with him took place in a relatively remote
part of the planet. </SPAN></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<p lang="en-US" align="JUSTIFY" style="page-break-inside: avoid; widows: 136">
<font face="Calibri, sans-serif"><font size="4">	I went to the
Traslasierra at the invitation of a group of families who had fled
the urban chaos of Buenos Aires and wanted to start an alternative
school for their children. They felt that I, as an expert of sorts in
alternative education and coordinator of a teacher-training seminar
in Buenos Aires, could provide some of the knowledge and impetus they
would need.</FONT></FONT></P>
<p lang="en-US" align="JUSTIFY" style="page-break-inside: avoid; widows: 136">
<font face="Calibri, sans-serif"><font size="4">	During the course I
gave and in various meetings with the aspiring school founders, I
learned that the suggestion to found our kind of school came from &quot;el
doctor&quot;, and that he was keen to meet me. In fact he invited me,
in writing, to lunch with him at his house when I was finished with
the group. His letter was formal, written in a spidery hand, and in
German. I don't know how he knew that I speak German and I never
asked him. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<p lang="en-US" align="JUSTIFY" style="page-break-inside: avoid; widows: 136">
<font face="Calibri, sans-serif"><font size="4">	He lived with his
housekeeper, Mireya, an attractive young woman of obvious Indian
descent, in a modest adobe house at an altitude of over five thousand
feet. It took us, an Indio driver and me, three hours to reach it in
a four-wheel drive pick-up mounted high over its chassis enabling us
to navigate the three streams we had to cross. Dr. Hableben was tall,
thin and wiry &ndash; and very old. His penetrating, wide-spread blue
eyes were watery with age. We ate a vegetarian lunch under a canopy
of grapevines lush with fruit, and washed it down with limpid water
from the stream that rushed by a few yards from us. Mireya prepared
the lunch and ate with us. She sat next to him, watching his every
move and listening intently, although he spoke in German.
Occasionally he absent-mindedly stroked her hand and looked at her in
what I can only describe as a loving way. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<p lang="en-US" align="JUSTIFY" style="page-break-inside: avoid; widows: 136">
<font face="Calibri, sans-serif"><font size="4">	I had expected that he
would want to know how my course went and what I thought of the
possibility of founding a school in the Traslasierra, but he never
even mentioned it. Instead he spoke of the book he had been working
on for years and had recently finished. He had tried to interest some
publishers in Germany, but the few who answered did so with form
letters &ndash; rejection slips, of which I have also had ample
experience. He wanted me to translate the book into English, my
native tongue, and get it published in America where, he thought,
people are more open to such things. I was curious, naturally, as to
what he meant by &quot;such things&quot;.</FONT></FONT></P>
<p lang="en-US" align="JUSTIFY" style="page-break-inside: avoid; widows: 136">
<font face="Calibri, sans-serif"><font size="4">	I knew that finding a
publisher for an unknown author may not be the most difficult thing
in the world, but it is high on the list. I said as much. He smiled
and said that it didn't matter, that the attempt, which is the
important thing, must be made. He asked Mireya, in Spanish, to fetch
the manuscript. She went inside the house and came back out carrying
an enormous pile of papers, which she set on the table after clearing
it of ants and blowing away some grape leaves. She put a stone on top
of the pile so it wouldn't blow away and resumed her seat. Doctor
Hableben invited me with a gesture of his hand to look at the
manuscript. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<p lang="en-US" align="JUSTIFY" style="page-break-inside: avoid; widows: 136">
<font face="Calibri, sans-serif"><font size="4">	The first yellowed
pages were written in small but firm letters of the old Gothic
script, which didn't disappear from Germany until after the Second
World War. I had once made myself familiar with this oddity, so I
could read it, but with some difficulty. I deciphered the first few
pages, which was enough to show me that the author possessed
learning, which he expressed in a philosophical style reminiscent of
the nineteenth century. I leafed through the rest and noticed that
toward the end the writing became spidery and shaky.</FONT></FONT></P>
<p lang="en-US" align="JUSTIFY" style="page-break-inside: avoid; widows: 136">
<font face="Calibri, sans-serif"><font size="4">	&quot;No publisher
nowadays will agree to read a handwritten manuscript,&quot; I said,
trying to worm my way out of the situation. &quot;It would have to be
typed.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<p lang="en-US" align="JUSTIFY" style="page-break-inside: avoid; widows: 136">
<font face="Calibri, sans-serif"><font size="4">	&quot;Of course,&quot;
the doctor said, &quot;but when you translate it you'll type it
anyway. I assume you have a word processor?&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<p lang="en-US" align="JUSTIFY" style="page-break-inside: avoid; widows: 136">
<font face="Calibri, sans-serif"><font size="4">	&quot;Well, yes, a
computer, but I have very little time.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<font face="Calibri, sans-serif"><font size="4">	&quot;My UFO life, to
be more specific.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<p lang="en-US" align="JUSTIFY" style="page-break-inside: avoid; widows: 136">
<font face="Calibri, sans-serif"><font size="4">	My first reaction was
surprise, then skepticism, which must have shown.</FONT></FONT></P>
<p lang="en-US" align="JUSTIFY" style="page-break-inside: avoid; widows: 136">
<font face="Calibri, sans-serif"><font size="4">	&quot;I had also been
skeptical about the so-called Unidentified Flying Objects,&quot; Dr.
Hableben said, &quot;because as a scientist I knew, firstly, that
there is no other human life in our solar system and, secondly, that it is
not possible to overcome the barrier of the speed of light in order
to reach beyond our system &ndash; until I read Professor Jung's
treatise on the subject.&quot; He stopped, popped a dark blue grape
into his mouth and kissed Mireya's hand, which must have been sweeter
than the grape, to judge by his expression.</FONT></FONT></P>
<p lang="en-US" align="JUSTIFY" style="page-break-inside: avoid; widows: 136">
<font face="Calibri, sans-serif"><font size="4">	&quot;Go on, please,&quot;
I said. Many years ago I had read Carl Jung's little book on flying
saucers, but had only a vague recollection of it.</FONT></FONT></P>
<p lang="en-US" align="JUSTIFY" style="page-break-inside: avoid; widows: 136">
<font face="Calibri, sans-serif"><font size="4">	&quot;Jung opines that
UFO's must exist because so many people have seen them down through
the centuries. What he doubts is that they exist physically.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<p lang="en-US" align="JUSTIFY" style="page-break-inside: avoid; widows: 136">
<font face="Calibri, sans-serif"><font size="4">	&quot;Then they are
imagined?&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<p lang="en-US" align="JUSTIFY" style="page-break-inside: avoid; widows: 136">
<font face="Calibri, sans-serif"><font size="4">	&quot;Not at all. He
meant that they exist psychically. And psychic phenomena were very
real to him, as they are to me.&quot; He leaned toward me and held
his hand in front of my eyes. &quot;This hand is physically real, is
it not?&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<p lang="en-US" align="JUSTIFY" style="page-break-inside: avoid; widows: 136">
<font face="Calibri, sans-serif"><font size="4">	&quot;As far as I'm
concerned it is, though some philosophers might not agree.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<p lang="en-US" align="JUSTIFY" style="page-break-inside: avoid; widows: 136">
<font face="Calibri, sans-serif"><font size="4">	&quot;And it also
exists psychically,&quot; he continued, ignoring the philosophers.
&quot;Somewhere, the psychic equivalent of my hand exists as an idea,
but ideas are also real. If such is the case, and I assure you that
it is, then psychic phenomena may have their physical equivalence in
another place in the cosmos. Do you follow me?&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<p lang="en-US" align="JUSTIFY" style="page-break-inside: avoid; widows: 136">
<font face="Calibri, sans-serif"><font size="4">	&quot;I think so,
yes.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<p lang="en-US" align="JUSTIFY" style="page-break-inside: avoid; widows: 136">
<font face="Calibri, sans-serif"><font size="4">	&quot;My hypothesis
was that it might be possible to so train the psyche, or the mind if
you prefer, so that we could find and witness the physical
equivalents of the UFOs.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<p lang="en-US" align="JUSTIFY" style="page-break-inside: avoid; widows: 136">
<font face="Calibri, sans-serif"><font size="4">	I took a few moments
to digest this, then: &quot;Do you mean, Herr Doktor, that some
extraterrestrial intelligence has been psychically projecting what we
call UFOs, and that they really exist, I mean physically, somewhere
else?&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<p lang="en-US" align="JUSTIFY" style="page-break-inside: avoid; widows: 136">
<font face="Calibri, sans-serif"><font size="4">	&quot;Exactly. So I
decided to dedicate myself to finding the 'somewhere else'. The book
is a faithful account of my experiments &ndash;  successful ones, I
might add &ndash; and their results.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<p lang="en-US" align="JUSTIFY" style="page-break-inside: avoid; widows: 136">
<font face="Calibri, sans-serif"><font size="4">	I know it sounds
nutty, but the doctor didn't come across as a nut.  &quot;Could you
tell me something about those results?&quot; I asked him.</FONT></FONT></P>
<p lang="en-US" align="JUSTIFY" style="page-break-inside: avoid; widows: 136">
<font face="Calibri, sans-serif"><font size="4">	&quot;Yes, but first
the method. I spent years perfecting a technique of concentration and
meditation which finally enabled me to leave my body at night during
sleep and make my way to the planet whose inhabitants have been
sending us their psychic images for ages.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<p lang="en-US" align="JUSTIFY" style="page-break-inside: avoid; widows: 136">
<font face="Calibri, sans-serif"><font size="4">	&quot;Wouldn't an
obvious objection be that you were dreaming?&quot; I asked, almost
apologetically.</FONT></FONT></P>
<p lang="en-US" align="JUSTIFY" style="page-break-inside: avoid; widows: 136">
<font face="Calibri, sans-serif"><font size="4">	&quot;A special kind
of conscious dreaming,&quot; he said, as though that explained it.
&quot;Of course I didn't do it alone. I reached the world of
spiritual ideas, a place where few Earthlings have been, and
transmitted my request to proceed to that planet. I had no idea where
it was in the physical universe, you see.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<p lang="en-US" align="JUSTIFY" style="page-break-inside: avoid; widows: 136">
<font face="Calibri, sans-serif"><font size="4">	&quot;To whom did you
transmit the request?&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<p lang="en-US" align="JUSTIFY" style="page-break-inside: avoid; widows: 136">
<font face="Calibri, sans-serif"><font size="4">	&quot;To a council of
spiritual beings. They decided in my favor and assigned one of their
number to guide me. If you must know &ndash; it isn't in the book,
you see &ndash; it was an angel, perhaps my own, he wouldn't say.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<p lang="en-US" align="JUSTIFY" style="page-break-inside: avoid; widows: 136">
<font face="Calibri, sans-serif"><font size="4">	&quot;Wow!&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<p lang="en-US" align="JUSTIFY" style="page-break-inside: avoid; widows: 136">
<font face="Calibri, sans-serif"><font size="4">	The doctor laughed.
&quot;Wow indeed. He took me by the hand, as it were, and we were
there in no time.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<p lang="en-US" align="JUSTIFY" style="page-break-inside: avoid; widows: 136">
<font face="Calibri, sans-serif"><font size="4">	&quot;What was it
called, the planet I mean?&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<p lang="en-US" align="JUSTIFY" style="page-break-inside: avoid; widows: 136">
<font face="Calibri, sans-serif"><font size="4">	&quot;It took me some
time to learn the language, although it wasn't much different from
some of our own. The best translation I can make is...Earth.&quot; </FONT></FONT>

<font face="Calibri, sans-serif"><font size="4">	&quot;You were right

<p lang="en-US" align="JUSTIFY" style="page-break-inside: avoid; widows: 136">
<font face="Calibri, sans-serif"><font size="4">	I found later in
studying the Book that this was only an assumption on his part. He
had not, after all, investigated the entire universe.</FONT></FONT></P>
<p lang="en-US" align="JUSTIFY" style="page-break-inside: avoid; widows: 136">
<font face="Calibri, sans-serif"><font size="4">	&quot;The beginning
was difficult, first of all because I was only there psychically and
was therefore invisible to the inhabitants. Furthermore, I had made
no provision for the care of my body back on Earth &ndash; our Earth,
that is &ndash; so I had to return before I starved to death or
dehydrated.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<p lang="en-US" align="JUSTIFY" style="page-break-inside: avoid; widows: 136">
<font face="Calibri, sans-serif"><font size="4">	&quot;But before you
came back what observations did you make?&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<p lang="en-US" align="JUSTIFY" style="page-break-inside: avoid; widows: 136">
<font face="Calibri, sans-serif"><font size="4">	&quot;Few, there was
so little time and so many overwhelming impressions. As you will have
guessed, they are very advanced technologically. And their airships
are indeed what we call UFOs, of many shapes and sizes. I was like an
aboriginal suddenly transported to a metropolis and didn't understand
half the things I was seeing. I had the impression, however, that
they were deeply troubled. That's all, though. I had to go.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<p lang="en-US" align="JUSTIFY" style="page-break-inside: avoid; widows: 136">
<font face="Calibri, sans-serif"><font size="4">	&quot;How did you do
that? Was the angel still with you?&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<p lang="en-US" align="JUSTIFY" style="page-break-inside: avoid; widows: 136">
<font face="Calibri, sans-serif"><font size="4">	&quot;No, he had
deposited me there, wished me good luck and left.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<p lang="en-US" align="JUSTIFY" style="page-break-inside: avoid; widows: 136">
<font face="Calibri, sans-serif"><font size="4">	&quot;So how then?&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<p lang="en-US" align="JUSTIFY" style="page-break-inside: avoid; widows: 136">
<font face="Calibri, sans-serif"><font size="4">	&quot;You must
understand that the difficulty is not in returning, but getting there
and staying. The whole time one must exert a great force of will. The
moment it is relaxed you are whisked back to your body. This control
of the will is something you develop through meditation &ndash;  a
powerful mixture of will and thought, or, I should say, thinking
raised to the level of pure will. So all I had to do was relax my
will and I was back in bed.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<p lang="en-US" align="JUSTIFY" style="page-break-inside: avoid; widows: 136">
<font face="Calibri, sans-serif"><font size="4">	&quot;Here, in the

<p lang="en-US" align="JUSTIFY" style="page-break-inside: avoid; widows: 136">
<font face="Calibri, sans-serif"><font size="4">	&quot;Yes, of course.
Such things are only possible in places of great peace. I was
extremely hungry and thirsty, for I had been gone for three days. I
won't bore you with details now, it's all in the book anyway. After a
certain amount of effort, I found someone trustworthy who had medical
experience and was willing to stay here with my body and control the
intravenous serum and feeding.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<font face="Calibri, sans-serif"><font size="4">	&quot;Naturally I
wondered about them and decided to seek them out. I found them after
many false starts and after having surmounted many obstacles. It's
all in the book.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<p lang="en-US" align="JUSTIFY" style="page-break-inside: avoid; widows: 136">
<font face="Calibri, sans-serif"><font size="4">	&quot;Yes, of course,

<p lang="en-US" align="JUSTIFY" style="page-break-inside: avoid; widows: 136">
<font face="Calibri, sans-serif"><font size="4">	&quot;They are a group
of individuals who have maintained a long tradition of esoteric
knowledge. But they must keep their activities secret because, you
see, a kind of self-imposed autocratic state has been established in
order to control the total anarchy that reined until about a
millennium ago. They are a kind of occult brotherhood &ndash; or
sisterhood rather &ndash; there being more women than men in it.&quot;
 He glanced meaningfully at Mireya, who smiled at him as though she
understood what he was saying in German, which seemed unlikely to me.
&quot;They long ago discovered essentially the same meditation
technique I used and had found us, another human race, just as I
found them. It is they and their forerunners who have been sending
signs to us in the form of Unidentified Flying Objects all this
time.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

Earth, yes,&quot; he answered patiently. &quot;Here they are
manifestations of light &ndash; round, oblong, flat, spherical &ndash;

I began as respectfully as I could, &quot;forgive my asking, but do
you have any proof of all this?&quot; I was leading up to saying what
I was thinking, that even if I believed him, and I wasn't sure that I
did, it would be mostly due to his strongly convincing presence.
Someone reading his Gothic prose would be much less inclined to give
him the benefit of the doubt. But his reply, which he shot out with
no hesitation, surprised me.</FONT></FONT></P>

explain in synthesis. She was a member of the group that sent the
signs and we communicated on a spiritual plane. She was my contact
person with her group. We could have had no karmic history, having
come from different worlds. Nevertheless we... well, yes, we fell in

Mireya and I had no mutual karma; ours is the first karmic
relationship between humans of our two worlds. But you and I, my

as I ask. You are free, however, to decide.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

totally honest manner, and what he said about going to his final
rest, were convincing. Nevertheless, I took a minute to make sure
that the decision would be my own. I walked a few yards away from the
table and gazed down into the valleys of the Traslasierra, a still
idyllic part of our deteriorating world, not the Other, but our own,
Earth. Then I went back and stood before him and told him that I
would do what he had requested.</FONT></FONT></P>

stay in contact with Mireya.&quot; He walked to the door of the
house, where he had to stoop to enter. Mireya called the driver and
put the manuscript in a strong shopping bag and handed it to me. We
kissed on the right cheeks, as is the custom, and she followed Doctor
Hableben into the house.</FONT></FONT></P>
