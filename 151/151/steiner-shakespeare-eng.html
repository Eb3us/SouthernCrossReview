<p>Notes from a lecture given in Berlin on May 6, 1902, GA 52<br />
Original translator unknown. Revised by Frank Thomas Smith</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Friends who heard that notes existed of a lecture on Shakespeare
given by Dr. Steiner in 1902 at the Workmen’s School in Berlin expressed
the wish to read these notes. They were taken down by Johanna Mïcke,
who did not know shorthand, so they do not claim to be complete. The 7
pages of typescript may correspond to about 25 pages of the original
text of the lecture. But important points emerge even from these
incomplete notes.</em></p>
<p>Marie Steiner</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to a remark by the famous writer <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Brandes">Georg Brandes</a>, we
should include Shakespeare in the German classics. And if we consider
the enormous influence Shakespeare has had on Goethe, schiller and the
development of German literature in general since he was rediscovered in
the middle of the eighteenth century, especially through Lessing, we
must agree with that remark especially in view of the excellent
translations of his work by <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_Wilhelm_Schlegel">Schlegel</a>
and Tieck.</p>
<p>A legend has arisen about Shakespeare and whole libraries have been
written about each of his works. Academics have given many
interpretations of his plays, and finally a number of writers have
decided that an uneducated actor could not have produced all the
thoughts which they discovered in Shakespeare’s works, and they became
addicted to the hypothesis that not William Shakespeare, the actor of
the Globe Theatre, could have written the plays which bear his name, but
some other highly learned man, for example <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Bacon">Lord Francis Bacon
of Verulam</a>, who in view of the low estimation of literary activity
at that time, borrowed the actor’s name. These suppositions are based on
the fact that no manuscripts written by Shakespeare's hand have ever
been found; they are also based upon a notebook discovered in a London
library with single passages in it which are supposed to correspond with
certain passages in Shakespeare’s plays. But Shakespeare’s own works
bear witness that he is their author. His plays reveal that they were
written by a man who had a thorough knowledge of the theatre and the
deepest understanding for theatrical effects.</p>
<p>That Shakespeare himself did not publish his plays was simply in
keeping with the general custom at his time. Not one of his plays was
printed during his lifetime. They were carefully kept under wraps;
people were to come to the theatre and see the plays there, not read
them at home. Prints which appeared at that time were pirated editions,
based on notes taken during the performances, so that the texts did not
completely correspond to the original versions, but were full of errors
and mutilations.</p>
<p>These partial omissions and mistakes led certain researchers to claim
that Shakespeare’s plays, as they were then available, were not works of
art of any special value and that originally they must have existed in
quite a different form. One of these researchers is Eugen Reichel, who
thinks that the author of Shakespeare’s plays was a man with a certain
definite worldview. But such opinions are contradicted by the fact that
the plays, in the form in which they now exist, exercise such an
extraordinary influence. We see this great effect in plays that have
undoubtedly been mutilated, for example in <em>Macbeth</em>. The hold of
Shakespeare’s plays on his audience was proved by a performance of
<em>Henry V</em> under the direction of Neuman-Hofer at the
inauguration of the Lessing Theatre. It did not fail to produce a
powerful impression in spite of an extremely bad translation and poor
acting.</p>
<p>Shakespeare’s plays are above all character dramas. The great
interest which they arouse does not so much lie in the action, as in the
wonderful development of the individual characters. The poet conjures up
before us a human character and unfolds his thoughts and feelings in the
presentation of an individual personality.</p>
<p>This artistic development, which culminated in Shakespeare, was made
possible by the preceding phase of cultural development: the
Renaissance. Shakespeare’s character-dramas could only arise as a result
of the higher estimation of the individual during the Renaissance.
During the early middle ages we find, even in Dante and in spite of his
strong personality, the basic expression of the Christian ideas of that
time. The Christian type of his time, not the individual human
personality, appeared in the foreground. This was the general
conception. The Christian principle had no interest in the individual
personality. But little by little a new worldview aroused interest in
the Individual human being. Only gradually did a new interest in the
individual arise by means of the different viewpoint.</p>
<p>The fact that Shakespeare’s fame spread so quickly proves that he
found an audience keenly interested in the theatre, that is to say, with
a certain understanding for the representation of the personality as
offered by Shakespeare. Shakespeare’s chief aim was to describe
individual characters, and he was far from presenting to his audience
an ethical or moral idea. For example, the idea of tragic guilt, as
found in Schiller’s dramas, who thought that he had to encumber his hero
with it in order to justify his downfall, does not exist in
Shakespeare’s plays. He simply allows the events to take their course
consistently, uninfluenced by the idea of guilt and atonement. It would
be difficult to find a concept of guilt in this sense in any of his
plays.</p>
<p>Shakespeare also did not intend to present a certain idea, not
jealousy in <em>Othello</em> or ambition in <em>Macbeth</em>, no, simply
the definite characters of Othello, Macbeth, or Hamlet. Just because he
did not burden his characters with theories was he able to create such
great ones. He was thoroughly acquainted with the stage, and this
practical knowledge enabled him to develop his action in such a way as
to thrill an audience. In the whole literature of the world there are no
plays which are so completely conceived from the standpoint of the
actor. This is a clear proof that Shakespeare, the <em>actor</em>, has
the merit of having written these plays.</p>
<p>Shakespeare was born in Stratford in 1564. His father was in fairly
good circumstances, so that his son was able to attend the Latin grammar
school in his hometown. There are many legends about Shakespeare’s
youth. Some say that he was a poacher and led an adventurous life. These
things have been adduced against his authorship, yet these very
experiences could only enrich his dramatic creation. Even the fact that
in spite of his good education he was not encumbered with higher
academic study, gave him the possibility to face things more freely and
in a far more unprejudiced way. The poet’s adventurous nature explains
to some extent some of the greatest qualities in his plays: the bold
flight of his fantasy, his sudden transformations in the action, his
passion and daring, all bear witness to a life full of movement and
color.</p>
<p>In 1585, when Shakespeare’s financial conditions were no longer in a
flourishing state, he went to London. There he began his theatrical
career in the most menial way, by holding the horses of the visitors
while they were enjoying the performance. He then became supervisor of a
number of such boys who had to hold the horses’ reins, and was at last
admitted to the stage. In 1592 he played his first important role.</p>
<p>His fame soon began to spread, both as an actor and as a dramatist,
and his conditions improved, so that in 1597 he was able to buy a house
in Stratford. After he became part-owner of the Globe Theatre he was a
wealthy man.</p>
<p>The plays written during Shakespeare’s first period: <em>Love’s
Labour Lost,</em> <em>As You Like It,</em> etc., do not differ so
greatly from the plays of his contemporaries, of Marlowe and others;
their expressive power, their purity and naturalness were moreover
impaired by a certain artificial note which was the fashion in those
days. The great character-plays, which were to establish his fame for
all time, followed: <em>Othello,</em> <em>Hamlet</em>, <em>Macbeth</em>,
<em>King Lear</em>, <em>Julius Caesar</em>.</p>
<p>Some of Shakespeare’s biographers and commentators wish to deduce
from certain of his later plays troubled experiences which embittered
him. But in Shakespeare’s case this is difficult to establish, because
his identity withdraws behind his characters. They do not voice
<em>his</em> thoughts, but they all think and act in accordance with
their own disposition and character.</p>
<p>It is consequently useless to ask what Shakespeare’s own standpoint
may have been on certain difficult questions. For it is not Shakespeare,
but Hamlet who broods over the problem of “<em>to be, or not to
be</em>”, who recoils from his father’s ghost, just as Macbeth recoils
from the witches. Whether Shakespeare believed in ghosts and witches,
whether he was a churchgoer or a freethinker, is not the point at
all: He simply asked himself: how should a ghost or a witch appear on
the stage so as to produce a strong effect upon the audience? The fact
that this effect is undiminished today proves that Shakespeare was able
to answer this question.</p>
<p>We should not forget that the modern stage is not favourable to the
effect which Shakespeare’s plays can produce. The importance which is
now attributed to props, costumes, the frequent changes of scenery, etc.
diminish the effect which is to be produced by the characters in the
plays; for this remains the chief thing. In Shakespeare’s time when a
change of scenery was simply indicated by a notice-board, when a table
and a chair sufficed for the furniture of a royal palace, the effect
produced by the characters must have been much greater than today.</p>
<p>Whereas in the modern theater so much depends on scenery, props,
etc., when the playwright usually gives a detailed description of the
scenery so that the effect of his plays may be handicapped by bad
staging, Shakespeare’s plays leave a strong impression, even when
performed badly.</p>
<p>And when a times comes in which we again see the essential more than
is the case today, will the effect of Shakespeare's art be ever
greater: through the power of characterization which remains alive and
unequaled through the centuries.</p>
