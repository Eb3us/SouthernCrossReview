<h3>Chapter Four</h3>
<p><strong>Londrina, January 1966</strong></p>
<p class="intro">Recently I had an interesting conversation with the GDS (German
Development Service). As I was originally supposed to be working here as
a teacher, but found upon arrival that there was already a school with
six teachers, I suggested that we organize a kindergarten and a sewing
circle. "But that isn't social work," was the answer. Now, however, it
has been recognized as social work and I am even to be allowed to take a
three-week kindergarten course in Gramado (Rio Grande do sul). The GDS
decisions are unfathomable. "Impenetrable like the GDS" has already
become a slogan.</p>
<p>Rio Grande do Sul is well suited to Europeans due to its temperate
climate and having been mostly colonized by Germans - and, to a lesser
extent, Italians and Poles. German or Platt dialect is mostly spoken,
except in the big cities. It is a far cry from the real Brazil; no black
faces, no openhearted sloppiness, no Brazilian <em>giria</em> (slang).
Instead "Cultivate the German heritage" is the motto. Children,
blue-eyed and blonder than in Germany, typical German farms with
cackling hens on dung-hills and carefully cultivated beets, apple and
pear trees instead of mamao and abacate, wine instead of cafezinho.</p>
<p>Yesterday we went on a great excursion. After walking five miles we
came to a waterfall surrounded by pine trees. Unfortunately, the place
had already been "opened" to tourism – cars and transistor radios were
all over the place. To be sure, we almost forgot this when we climbed
down a sixty-yard steep slope through the jungle, scrub, prickles and
lianas. Half crawling and with courageously suppressed fear of
tree-snakes, we made our way to the waterfall. We saw no snakes, only
two oncas, tiger-cats, who glared at us from a branch, then quickly
disappeared.</p>
<p><strong>Londrina, February 1966</strong></p>
<p>Events overlap: a trip to Mato Grosso, the opening of the
kindergarten, a thief in the house. Let's start with the thief. At six
o'clock this morning I heard someone moving about and thought it
suspicious because on Saturdays everybody sleeps longer. I investigated
and found Helmut wandering around the kitchen and dining-room. He jumped
down my throat furiously in my half-awake state: Whose idea was this
joke? What joke? He told me about his clothes being scattered about, the
suitcase found chewed up by goats in the garden, and his radio that had
disappeared. He thought we had hidden his things in order to inaugurate
his moving into the new room. The affair was cleared up when I found
traces of red earth on the easy-chair and windowsill as well as a clear
footprint and fresh terra roxa on the stoop - the thief was clean enough
to wipe his shoes before entering. A <em>ladrao</em> (robber) had
honored us with his presence during the night.</p>
<p>Helmut, in good detective form, found more footprints and measured
the length of the stride, from which he determined that they were made
by a man with a 35 inch stride. We were told later that there are
<em>maconha</em> cigarettes here, the smoke of which can temporarily
weaken the ability to react, to the extent that a scoundrel can take
something out of your pocket with complete peace of mind. Helmut, lulled
by the maconha smoke, slept through the robbery. Also, the open window
must have been too great a temptation for the thief.</p>
<p>In defense of Brazilians and the favela, I must say that until now
nothing had been stolen from us despite the house door being unlocked
day and night. Shoes and laundry remain on the porch during the day and
we are often absent for days at a time. When the favela people want to
steal they probably do so from the rich in town where, however, the
houses are guarded at night.</p>
<p>Now to Mato Grosso. The trip goes under this name, although we barely
touched its outer edge -- Tres Lagos and the satellite city of Pilotos.
Pilotos is a city for the workers who are building two dams on the
Paraná  River which are to supply Sao Paulo and Paraná with electricity.
It will be one of the world's most important dam complexes. The work
rhythm corresponds to its importance. Everything is well-organized,
clean, expedient, clear and "technical". The modern, aspiring side of
Brazil comes to light here. The workers are well treated, they earn more
than usual, at least $100 monthly with free housing, inexpensive food
and free medical care. We saw no one in rags, no beggars or rubbish
lying about. Early in the morning we saw men raking leaves, mowing the
grass, repairing defective lights. Everyone has his job, everything
fits.</p>
<p>From Pilotos we went to Guararápes in the State of Sao Paulo. The
parents-in-law of Manuelo, a carpenter from our favela with whom we were
traveling, live there. As though it were the most natural thing in the
world, we were fed and the family squeezed together so we could also
sleep there.</p>
<p>We experienced the desolation of a medium-sized city in the interior
of Brazil, and the life of a Brazilian family which, although it is
beyond the anxiety about its daily bread, is completely untouched by
culture - a not very happy in-between stage, as they have left childish
simplicity (most favelados) behind them, but haven't yet discovered
thinking.</p>
<p>I almost forgot the funniest part. As I jumped out of bed early in
the morning raring to go and to see everything, I realized that my right
eye was stuck shut, only a tiny slit remaining open. During the day this
also closed and when I awoke the next morning both eyes were so swollen
that I had to grope blindly about. I, who had set out to see Brazil,
could barely make out the coffee cup in front of me. Kaspar said I
should go to a doctor. Luckily, we had the idea to buy sunglasses, after
which the swelling went down to the extent that I could see again - a la
Japanese. During the third night I got a clue to the cause of this
strange swelling. I woke up with a dreadful itching, put on the light
and saw a horde of bed-bugs hurriedly disappear into their
hiding-places. I fell into a true scratching ecstasy, controlled myself
for a few seconds, then went at it again in full frenzy until,
exhausted, I let the beasts have their way with me. Apparently they had
also bitten me on the eyelids.</p>
<p>And now to the kindergarten! I have two groups, one from eight to
eleven o'clock, the other from one to four. I have at my disposal four
balls, match-sticks, some homemade dolls, jump-ropes and all kinds of
miscellaneous stuff like coconut shells, rags, crayons, paper, etc. What
makes the work difficult is that the children are especially jumpy and
lack concentration, never want to occupy themselves with one thing for
more than five minutes. Most of them didn't even know what toys were.
Another problem is that they have so little sense of community. They
want to pick up as many toys as possible and, from fear that another
will take them away, hold on to them compulsively instead of playing
with them. My back is no sooner turned than the toys are fought over,
sometimes quite violently. With my squeaky voice trying to be
thunderous, I restore order. Sometimes I think that I am too strict.
After all, it's only too understandable that they are so greedy. But at
some point they must learn to do things in community.</p>
<p>Discipline is unknown to them and they don't even obey their own
parents. To form a circle or a line is practically impossible. When I
have the last ones in order, the first ones are already dancing out of
line. They simply cannot wait.</p>
<p>Another difficulty is that children of the same age are in such
different stages of development. Some are in the crawling stage, others
toddling, some draw people with their arms stuck onto their heads. They
are all five to six years old but very different in their physical
development. The black children look to be the strongest and the blonde,
light-skinned ones seem to have the least resistance to the climate and
illness. Most of the children look undernourished. They are regularly
given rice and beans for lunch but lack protein and vitamins. The food
here is very poor in mineral salts and in general is less nutritious
than in Europe. This may be why they mature too early under the tropical
sun and don't have time to draw strength from the earth. It seems to me
that the apathy and debility of many Brazilians can be traced to this
century-old vitamin deficient, carbohydrate-based diet. In the
kindergarten, spontaneous outbreaks of unalloyed joy of being are
followed by hours of indifference and sleepiness. Recently a little girl
said with true self-knowledge: "Today I'm especially lazy." She hangs
over the table and can't be moved, not even to put a crayon in her
hand.</p>
<p>That's the negative side, which, as is well known, is so much easier
to relate. How shall I describe that they are dear and affectionate?
They bring me flowers, they share with me their only sucked-on candy,
want to give me their hamster. They fan me with admirable endurance when
it gets too stuffy in the kindergarten.</p>
<p>Today I again noted how little family life there is in the favela.
During the mid-day break I was at Darcy's, my keenest morning pupil. The
family is very orderly, the father works for the prefecture as a
street-sweeper and therefore belongs to the favela's privileged class,
because he has a regular income and will receive a small pension later.
Darcy sat in a corner with a plate of rice and beans on her lap and ate
her lunch. Mirinha, the younger sister, squatted on the stoop and picked
obstinately at her food. No table, at which the family could be
together, at least for lunch. At that moment the table became the symbol
of family life for me. Usually one doesn't even think about it, but here
in Brazil, and especially in the favela, it becomes increasingly clear
to me how important it is that children have a proper space in which to
pass their young lives. And a daily program with regular mealtimes,
during which the family is together, belongs to this. In Germany the
home is the center for the family; here everything is aimed away from
the home. Even the sick would rather hang around a street corner than
stay in bed at home. Getting up early at a certain hour certainly
belongs to this regular daily program, and children are sent to bed at a
certain hour. Here the children are often out on the street until
midnight before they go to sleep - often in a family bed - and are so
tired the next morning that they have no desire to go to school.</p>
<p><strong>May 1966</strong></p>
<p>Today is Mother's Day. Apparently it is celebrated much more here
than in Germany. The school celebrates with cookies and lemonade, the
prefecture distributes meat and noodles in the favela. Like the
<em>churrascada</em> for the prefecture employees on May Day, this
distribution in the favela seems so patriarchal to me. It's nice of
them, somehow human, to think of the poor, but it is not enough when,
with a sincerely friendly smile, you give presents to minimum-wage
earners. You should rather give them the opportunity to buy meat and
noodles for themselves, to struggle and to stand on their own feet. In
my opinion, the most important thing is educational reform, and not only
in a general sense (schools for all), but in a more profound sense
(better school programs).</p>
<p>Yes, person to person Brazilians are generous and willing to help the
poor. But the same people who give Fray Nereu a check for housing in the
favela refuse to cooperate with decisive steps which would bring about
fundamental changes (land reform, educational reform, street
construction, reduction in coffee planting).</p>
<p>Every day I see Dona Dita walking in the midday heat with a load of
freshly washed laundry balanced on her head. And an hour later she goes
in the opposite direction with a bundle of dirty laundry under her arm.
She works for some rich city families in order to earn school money for
her son. It is admirable with what perseverance she washes in the stream
hour after hour in order to give her son a high school education. She
has discovered that you can only escape poverty through learning,
learning and more learning.</p>
<p>But even when they have been to high school and have learned a trade,
it is difficult for the poor to get a good job without having
connections. More so if you are black. How stupid it is to characterize
blacks as inferior and lazy. Brazil wouldn't even exist without the
blacks. They worked like animals on the sugar plantations of Bahia and
Pernambuco and in the mines of Minas Gerais and in this way kept the
Brazilian economy viable. Furthermore, it was the intermixing of the
Portuguese masters with their black slaves which - purely numerically -
made the settlement and development of Brazil possible.</p>
<p>It wasn't only their strong arms, their labor-power, that they
brought to Brazil, but also their abilities, their craftsmanship, their
artistic sensitivity and their experience with tropical agriculture.
They were far superior in agriculture and cattle-raising to the Indios
and Portuguese. Also their food habits were less one-sided. Many plants,
such as beans and bananas, were brought in by the blacks. Even cattle:
the goats and sheep were imported from Africa.</p>
<p>The Sudanese, of Islamic religion, brought a specially active element
to Brazil. They organized the slaves, gathered runaways and led them to
the jungle where they organized their own settlements, the so-called
<em>quilombos</em>, which prospered and offered proof of the Blacks'
ability, especially in agriculture. They read the Koran in Arabic and
thus it happened that in the early Portuguese colonization period there
were fewer illiterates in the slave-huts than in their masters'
mansions. The slaves were more cultured than their masters!</p>
<p>However, the reverse is now the case: the blacks are neglected and
barely educated. That's why it is so important that a black woman like
Dona Dita goes to so much trouble to send her son the high school.</p>
<p>What would Brazil be without blacks, without the contagious laughter
of a Didi, the African rhythms of so many songs and dances, without
Macumba, without the calm composure and motherliness of many black
women, or the childish devotion of a Tereza? It is all a necessary
counter-weight to the somewhat melancholic, reserved character of the
Indios.</p>
