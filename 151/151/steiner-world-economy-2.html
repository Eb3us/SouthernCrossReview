<p class="intropoem">Ladies and Gentlemen,</p>
<p>It is precisely in this sphere of Political Economy that the first
conceptions and ideas which we have to develop cannot but be a little
complicated — and for a perfectly genuine reason. For you must imagine
the economic process, considered even as a world-economy, as a thing of
perpetual movement. As the blood flows through the human being, so do
goods, as merchandise or commodities, flow by every conceivable channel
through the whole economic body. And we must conceive, as the most
important thing within this economic process, all that takes place in
buying and selling. That, at least, is true of the economic life of
today. Whatever else there may be — and we shall of course have to
consider the most varied impulses contained in economic life — whatever
else there may be, the subject of Economics comes home to a man directly
when he has something to buy or sell. In the last resort the instinctive
thinking of every naive person on economic matters culminates in the
process taking place between buyer and seller. Fundamentally, this is
what it all comes to.</p>
<p>Consider now: What is it that counts when buying and selling are
considered in the economic process? The thing that a man cares about
will always be the price of a commodity, the price of the piece of goods
concerned. In the last resort all the most important economic
considerations really merge in this question of Price. All the impulses
and forces that are at work in economics culminate at length in Price.
We shall, therefore, first have to consider the problem of Price, but it
is by no means a simple problem. You need only consider the most simple
case: At a given place, A, we have a certain commodity: at place A it
has a certain price. But suppose it is not bought there but is first
transported to another place, B. Our endeavour will then be to add to
the price whatever transport charges had to be paid from A to B. Thus
the Price changes in the process of circulation. There we have the
simplest — if I may put it so, the flattest — instance: but of course
there are far more complex cases.</p>
<p>Assume, for instance, that at a given date a house in a large town
costs so much. Fifteen years later the same house may perhaps cost six
times as much: nor need we imagine that the main cause of the rise in
price lies in the devaluation of money. On the contrary, let us assume
that this is not the case. The rise in price may simply lie in this:
that in the meantime many other houses have been built around it: the
other buildings, now situated in its neighbourhood, greatly increase the
value of the house. Nay, there may be ten or fifteen other circumstances
accounting for the rise in price. Truth to tell, we are never in a
position to apply some general statement to the single case — to say,
for instance: The price of houses, or railways, or cereals, can he
uniquely determined, at a given place, from certain specified
conditions. To begin with, we can say little more than this: that we
must observe how the price fluctuates with place and time. Then,
perhaps, we can trace some of the conditions whereby at a given place a
given price actually emerges. But there can be no such thing as a
general definition stating how the price of a thing is composed: that is
an impossibility. Again and again one is astonished to find Price
discussed in the ordinary works on Economics, as though it were possible
to define it. We simply cannot define it, for a price is always concrete
and specific. Altogether, in economic matters, it is impossible to get
anywhere near the realities by definitions.</p>
<p>I once witnessed the following case: In a certain district land is
comparatively cheap. There is a Society with a more or less famous man
in its midst. The Society buys up all the cheap plots of land, and
prevails upon the famous man to build himself a house there. Then the
plots of land are offered for sale. They can be offered at a
considerably higher price than they were bought for, for the simple
reason that the famous man has been persuaded to build himself a house
there.</p>
<p>Such instances will show you how indeterminate are the conditions on
which the price of a thing depends in the economic process. Of course,
you may say, such developments must be counteracted. Land reformers and
people with similar aims try to resist these things. Through various
artificial measures they desire to establish a kind of just price for
all things. Of course one can do so: but, economically considered, the
price is not changed thereby. In the above instance, for example, when
the plots of land are sold at a higher price, we can take the money away
again, in the form of a high property-tax. Then the State will pocket
the difference: but the reality remains as before. In reality the
increase in price has taken place just the same. You can take preventive
measures, they will but obscure the issue. The price will still be what
it would have been without them. You only bring about a redistribution:
and it is no true economic thinking to say that the land has not
increased in price during the last ten years, simply because you have
obscured the matter by artificial measures. Economic Science must stand
firmly on its feet, on a basis of reality. In Economics we can only
speak of the conditions obtaining at a given time and at the actual
place to which we are referring. Needless to say, anyone who desires the
progress of mankind will still come to the conclusion that such and such
things are to be changed. But, to begin with, things must be observed in
their immediate reality at the particular moment. From all this you will
see how impossible it is to approach such a concept as this — the most
important in Economics (I mean the concept of Price) — by seeking to
grasp it with sharply defined notions. In the science of Economics we
can make no progress by this means: quite other ways must be adopted. We
must observe the economic process itself.</p>
<p>Yet the problem of Price is of cardinal importance: all our efforts
must be directed to this. We must observe the economic process, and try,
as it were, to catch the point where (at any given place and time) the
actual price of a given thing results from all the underlying economic
causes.</p>
<p>Now if you take the ordinary economic doctrines, you will generally
find three factors mentioned — three factors, through the interplay of
which the whole economic process is supposed to take its course. They
are: Nature, human Labour and Capital. It is true that we can say to
begin with: Tracing the economic process we find these three: that which
comes from Nature, that which is achieved by human Labour and that which
is derived from, or directed by means of, Capital. But if we take
Nature, Labour and Capital simply side by side in this way, we shall not
grasp the economic process in a living way. On the contrary, we shall be
led to many one-sided points of view — a fact to which the history of
economic theory bears eloquent witness. Some say that all Value is
inherent in Nature and that no especial value is added to the substance
of natural objects by human Labour. Others believe that all true
economic Value is really impressed on a piece of goods, on a commodity,
by the Labour which, as they sometimes say, is crystallised in the
commodity. Or again, the moment you place Capital and Labour merely side
by side, you will find persons saying on the one hand: In reality it is
Capital which alone makes Labour possible and the wages of Labour are
paid out of the accumulated Capital. On the other side it is said: No,
the only thing that produces real Value is Labour, and all that Capital
obtains for itself is the surplus value abstracted from the yield of
Labour.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, the fact is this: Consider the things from the
one point of view, and the one is right: consider them from the other
point of view, and the other is right. Over against the reality, such
ways of thinking remind one of many a method in book-keeping — put the
item here and this will be the result: put it there, and that will. One
can speak with strong apparent reasons of surplus value, saying that
this is abstracted from the wages of Labour and appropriated by the
capitalist to himself. But one can say with equally good reasons, that,
in the whole connection of economic life, everything is due in the first
place to the capitalist, who can only pay his workers from what he has
available for the wages of Labour. For both these points of view there
are very good and very bad reasons. In fact, none of these ways of
thinking comes near the reality of economics. Excellent as a basis for
agitations, they are of no importance in a serious economic science.
Quite other foundations must be found if we would hope for progress in
economic life.</p>
<p>Up to a certain point, of course, all these systems have their
justification. Adam Smith, for instance, sees the real, original
value-forming factor in the work or labour that is expended on things.
Here again excellent reasons can be brought forward in support of this
view. Such a man as Adam Smith certainly did not think in a stupid or
nonsensical way. Nevertheless, here again there is the underlying idea
of taking hold of something static and giving it a definition, whereas
in the real economic process things are in perpetual movement. It is
comparatively simple to form concepts of the phenomena of Nature — even
the most complicated — as compared with the ideas which we require for a
science of Economics. Infinitely more complicated, variable and unstable
are the phenomena in Economics than in Nature — more fluctuating, less
capable of being grasped with any defined or hard and fast concepts. In
effect, an altogether different method must be adopted. You will only
find this method difficult in the first lessons: but as a result of it —
you will presently see — we shall discover the only real and possible
foundation for a science of Economics.</p>
<p>To begin with, we may say that to this economic process, which we
must now consider, three things contribute: Nature, human Labour and
(thinking, to begin with, of the purely external economic aspect)
Capital. <em>To begin with,</em> ladies and gentlemen!</p>
<p>But lest us consider at once the middle one of these three, namely,
human Labour. Let us try to form a conception of it by going down, as I
indicated yesterday, into the sphere of animal life. Let us observe,
instead of the economy of peoples, the economy of sparrows, the economy
of swallows.</p>
<p>Here, you see at once, Nature is the basis of economy. True, even the
sparrow has to do a <em>kind</em> of work: at the very least, he must
hop about to find his food. Sometimes he has to hop about a very great
deal in the course of a day to find what he requires. The swallow
building her nest also has to do a kind of work, and she again has much
to do to build it. Nevertheless, in the true economic sense, we cannot
call this “work,” we cannot call it “Labour.” We shall make no progress
in economic ideas if we call this labour. For if we observe more
closely, we shall have to admit: The sparrow and the swallow are
organised precisely in such a way as to do the very things — fulfil the
very functions — which they fulfil in finding their food, etc. They
simply could not be healthy if they had no opportunity to move about in
this way. It is part and parcel of their organisation: it belongs to
them, no less than their legs and wings. In seeking to build up economic
concepts, we can therefore leave out of account what we might here call
a mere “apparent Labour,” a “semblance of Labour.” In such cases Nature
is taken just as she is, and the single creature, merely to satisfy its
own needs or those of its nearest kin, carries out the corresponding
“semblance of Labour.” If, however, we wish to determine what is “Value”
or “a Value” in the true economic sense, we must disregard this apparent
Labour. And this must be our first object — to approach a true concept
of “economic value.”</p>
<p>Consider the animal economy once more. There we may say: Nature alone
is the value-forming factor. If we now ascend to man, that is, to
political economy, it is true we still have — from the side of Nature —
the same starting-point of “Nature Value.” But the moment human beings
no longer provide merely for themselves or for their nearest kindred,
but for one another, “human Labour,” properly so called, comes into
account. Indeed, the moment a man no longer uses the Nature-products for
himself, but stands in some relation to other human beings — if only to
the extent of bartering his goods with theirs — what he then does
becomes, in relation to Nature, “human Labour.” Here we arrive at the
one aspect of Value in Political Economy. It arises thus: Human Labour
is expended on the products of Nature, and we have before us in economic
circulation Nature-products transformed by human Labour. It is only here
that a true economic value first arises. So long as the Nature-product
is untouched, at the place where it is found in Nature, it has no other
value than it has, for instance, for the animals. But the moment you
take the very first steps to put the Nature-product into the process of
economic circulation, the Nature-product so transformed begins to have
economic value. We may therefore characterise this economic value as
follows: “An economic value, seen from this one aspect, is a
Nature-product transformed by human Labour.” Whether the human Labour
consists in digging or chopping, or merely moving a product of Nature
from one place to another, is irrelevant. If we are seeking the
determination of Value in general, then we must simply say: “One
value-forming factor is human Labour, transforming a Nature-product so
as to pass it into the economic process of circulation.”</p>
<p>If you consider this, you will see at once how very fluctuating is
the value of a piece of goods circulating in the economic life. For
Labour is something always present, perpetually being expended on the
goods. You cannot really say what Value is — you can only say: Value
appears in a given place and at a given time, inasmuch as human Labour
is transforming some product of Nature. That is where Value emerges. To
begin with, we cannot and will not try to define Value: We simply point
out the place where it appears. I will put this down diagrammatically.
(see Diagram 2) Here on the left side of the drawing we have Nature as
it were in the background. Human Labour approaches Nature: what then
becomes visible — appearing, as it were, through the interplay of Nature
and human Labour — that is the one aspect of economic value? It is by no
means a faulty image if we say, for instance: Look at a black surface or
at anything black through a luminous medium and you will see it blue.
According as the luminous medium is thick or thin, you will see various
shades of blue: according as you shift it, its density will vary: it is
for ever fluctuating. So it is</p>
<p><img src="steiner-economy-diagram.jpg" class="alarge" /></p>
<p>with Value in the economic life, it is really none other than the
appearance of Nature through human Labour. And that, too, is always
fluctuating.</p>
<p>To begin with, we are gaining a few abstract indications and little
more: but these will give us our bearings during the next few days and
help us to reach more concrete things. After all, you are accustomed to
this: for in all sciences one takes what is most simple to begin
with.</p>
<p>You see, labour as such has no purpose at all in Economics. A man may
chop wood, or he may get up on to a wheel like this. (There are such
wheels for the benefit of fat people who go on climbing from step to
step; the wheel goes round under them, and so they hope to get thinner.)
The man who treads this wheel may be doing just as much work as the one
who chops wood. To consider Labour as Marx did, when he said that we
should look for its equivalent in the amount that is consumed in the
human organism by the Labour, is a colossal piece of nonsense. For the
same amount is consumed whether a man chops wood or dances about on this
wheel. How much is done in the human being is not the point in
Economics. We have already seen how the subject of Economics borders on
uneconomic matters. Purely economically speaking, it is quite
unjustifiable to point to the fact that Labour uses up the human being's
forces. I mean it is unjustifiable in this connection, where, to begin
with, we wish to establish a concept of Labour in the sense of
Economics. Indirectly it is of great significance, for on the other side
the needs of men have to be cared for. But Marx's way of thinking at
this point is a colossal piece of nonsense.</p>
<p>What do we need in order to grasp “Labour” in the economic process?
It is necessary, to begin with — quite apart from the human being — to
observe how Labour <em>enters</em> into the economic process. This
labour (of the man on the wheel) does not enter it at all: it simply
adheres to the man himself. The chopping of wood, on the other hand,
does enter the economic process. The one thing that matters is:
<em>How</em> does the Labour enter the economic process? The answer is
this: Nature is everywhere transformed by human Labour and only in so
far as Nature is transformed by human Labour do we create real economic
values on this one side. If, for instance, we find it necessary for our
bodily health, having worked upon Nature in some way, to dance a little
or to do eurythmy in the intervals, all this may of course be judged
from another standpoint: but what we do in the intervals cannot be
described as work or Labour in the economic sense, nor can it be
regarded as in any way a factor creating economic values. Seen from
another side, it may well be creating values, but we must first get our
concepts pure and clear concerning economic values as such.</p>
<p>Now there is a second, altogether different, possibility for economic
values to arise. It is this: We turn our attention to labour as such: we
take labour as the given thing. To begin with, as you have seen just
now, labour, economically speaking, is something neutral and irrelevant.
But it becomes an economic value-creating factor the moment we let it be
directed by the intelligence of man. I must now speak in a somewhat
different sense from before. Even in the most far-fetched cases, you can
imagine something that would otherwise not be Labour at all being
transformed into real Labour by human intelligence. If it occurs to a
man, in order to get thinner, to set up that apparatus which we spoke of
in his bedroom and practise on it, there will be no economic value in
it. But, if somebody winds a rope round the wheel and uses it to drive
some machine, the moment this is done, that which would not otherwise be
Labour at all, in the economic sense, is turned to good account by the
Spirit. Incidentally the fellow who treads the wheel will get thinner
just the same, but the essential point is this: Through the Spirit — by
intelligence, reflection, perhaps even speculation — Labour is given a
certain direction: the various units of Labour are brought into certain
mutual relations, and so on.</p>
<p>Thus, we may say: Here we have the second aspect of the value-forming
factors in Economics. Here Labour stands in the background, and before
it is the Spirit which directs the Labour. Labour shines <em>through the
Spirit,</em> and this creates once more an economic value. As you will
soon see, these two aspects are present everywhere. Having shown in this
diagram (left) how an economic value emerges when we have Nature
appearing through Labour — if we now wish to represent diagrammatically
what we have just explained, we shall have to put Labour in the
background and in the front of it the spiritual, which gives it a
certain modification (right).</p>
<p>These are the two essential poles of the economic process. There are
indeed no other ways in which economic values are created. Either Nature
is modified by Labour, or Labour is modified by Spirit (human
intelligence). The outer expression of the Spirit, in this connection,
is in the manifold formations of Capital. Economically, the Spirit must
be looked for in the configurations of Capital: these at any rate are
its outward expression. We shall realise the facts more clearly when we
come to consider Capital as such, and then Capital as a monetary
medium.</p>
<p>So you see there can be no question of arriving at a definition of
economic value. Once more you need only consider on how many
circumstances — on the cleverness or stupidity of how many different
people — the modification of Labour by the Spirit in any given instance
will depend. There is every kind of fluctuating condition. Nevertheless,
this fact will always be in evidence: The value-creating factors in the
economic process will always be found at these two opposite poles.</p>
<p>Suppose now we find ourselves at any given point within the economic
process. The economic process takes its course in the activities of
buying and selling. Buying and selling are essentially an exchange of
values: there is, in fact, no other exchange than that of values.
Properly speaking, it is wrong to speak of an exchange of goods. The
“goods” that play a part in the economic process — whether they appear
as modified products of Nature or modified Labour — are always
<em>values.</em> It is always the values that are exchanged. Whenever a
process of buying and selling takes place, values are exchanged. Now
what is it that emerges in the economic process when value and value, as
it were, impinge on one another in the process of exchange? It is Price.
Wherever Price emerges, it is always through the impact of value on
value in the economic process. For this reason you cannot think truly
about Price if you have in mind the exchange of mere goods. If you buy
an apple for a penny, you may say that you are exchanging one piece of
goods for another — the apple for the penny. But you will make no
progress in economic thinking along these lines. For the apple has been
picked somewhere and then transported, and it may well be that various
other things have been done around it. All this is Labour which has
modified it. What you are dealing with is not an apple but a
Nature-product transformed by human Labour, representing an economic
value. In Economics we must always take our start from <em>values.</em>
Similarly, the penny represents not a piece of goods but a value, for
after all (or so at any rate we must suppose) the penny is but the sign
for the fact that there is present, in the man who has to buy the apple,
another value which he exchanges for it.</p>
<p>Today I am anxious for you to get a clear insight into this fact: In
Economics we must not speak of “goods” but of “values” as the elementary
thing. It is wrong to try to consider Price in any other way than by
envisaging the interplay of values. Value set against value gives you
Price. And if, as we saw, value itself is a fluctuating thing, incapable
of definition, may we not say that when you exchange value for value,
Price which arises in the process of exchange is a fluctuating thing
raised to the second power?</p>
<p>From all these things you may see how futile it is to try to grasp
values and prices with the idea of finding a firm and fixed ground in
Economics: and it is still more futile if your object is to influence
the economic process in practice. Something altogether different is
needful — something that lies behind all these things. You may see this
from a very simple consideration.</p>
<p>Consider this for a moment: Nature appears to us through human
Labour. Suppose we obtain iron at a given place under extraordinarily
difficult conditions. The value that is thus produced through human
Labour is a modified object of Nature. If at a different place iron is
to be produced under far easier conditions, it may happen that an
altogether different value will result. You see, therefore, that we
cannot grasp the reality in the value itself: we must go <em>behind</em>
the value. We must go back to that which creates the value: here alone
can we gradually find our way to the more constant conditions on which
we can exercise a direct influence. The moment you have brought the
value into economic circulation, you must let it fluctuate with the
economic organism as a whole. Consider the finer constitution of a blood
corpuscle: it is different in the head and in the heart and in the
liver. You cannot say: We will now seek the true definition of blood.
The most you can do is to consider what are the more favourable
foodstuffs in the one case and in the other. Likewise there is no point
in talking round and round about Value and Price. The important thing is
to go back to the primary factors, back to that which, if rightly
formed, will actually bring forth the proper price. The proper price
will then emerge of its own accord.</p>
<p>In the study of Economics it is quite impossible to stop short at
definitions of Value and Price. We must always go back to the real
origins whence the economic process is nourished, on the one hand, and
by which, on the other hand, it is regulated — Nature on the one hand,
Spirit on the other.</p>
<p>In all economic theories of modern time, this has been the
difficulty: <em>they have always tried to hold fast at the outset that
which is really fluctuating.</em> As a result, one who can see through
these things finds himself confronted not with <em>wrong</em>
definitions — scarcely any of them are wrong: they are generally quite
right! (Though, it is true, one must make an exceedingly bad shot to
say: The amount of Labour corresponds to that which has been expended
and has to be restored in the human body: it corresponds, therefore, to
the expenditure of substance. Such a statement is really a howler, and
he who makes it has failed to see the simplest things). No, the point is
that even men of considerable insight, in developing their theory of
Economics, have stumbled again and again over this obstacle: They have
tried to observe at rest things that are always in a state of flux. For
the things of Nature one can and must often do so: there, however, it
suffices to observe the state of rest in a quite different way: and if
we have to observe a state of movement, all we have come to do in the
modern science of Nature is to regard it as though it were composed of a
multitude of tiny states of rest and jump from one to the other. For
when we <em>integrate,</em> we regard even movement as if it were
composed of states of rest.</p>
<p>On the model of such a science we cannot study the economic process.
This, therefore, must be said: The first thing needful in grappling with
the science of Economics is to consider how, on the one hand, Value
appears inasmuch as Nature is transformed by human Labour — Nature is
seen through human Labour — while, on the other hand, Value appears
inasmuch as Labour is seen through the Spirit. These two origins of
Value are the real polar opposites: they differ as, in the spectrum, the
one — the luminous or yellow pole — differs from the other — the blue or
violet. You may well hold fast this picture: As in the spectrum the warm
colours appear on the one side, so on the one side there appears the
Nature-value which will show itself more in the formation of rents. On
this side we perceive Nature transformed by Labour. On the other side
there appear to us instead those values which are translated into
Capital: here we see Labour transformed by the Spirit. Then, indeed,
Price can arise, inasmuch as values of the one pole impinge on values of
the other. Or again, the several values within the one pole come into
mutual interaction. The point is that every time, wherever it is a
question of price-formation, there will be a mutual interaction of value
and value. We must therefore disregard everything to do with the
substances and materials themselves; we must look away from all this and
begin by seeing how values are formed, on the one side and on the other.
Then we shall be able to press forward to the problem of Price.</p>
