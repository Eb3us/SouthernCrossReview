<h3>Introduction</h3>
<h3>Goethe’s <em>Faust</em> as the "Metamorphosis of a Single Human Being"</h3>

</header>

<main>
<p class="intro">In considering Goethe as a scientist, we may naturally look at his
color theory and his essays on the metamorphoses of plants and animals.
But why not include his magnum opus, <em>Faust</em>, as the culmination
of his <em>scientific</em> writings? After all, if we extend the
perspective of Goethean science, could we not call <em>Faust</em>: "The
Metamorphosis of a Single Human Being?"</p>
<p>And what a human being Goethe gives us! Henry Faust, a single,
middle-aged professor at a major central European University who is so
bored by his life that he conjures up the devil Mephistopheles to rescue
himself from his academic ennui and depression?</p>
<p>Is this hitting too close to home here? If so, perhaps I should
generalize more. Might we not see the appearance of Mephistopheles to
Faust as the appearance of chaos and complexity to modern science and
academia which is equally bored with the inane intellectual ordering and
gross oversimplifying of the universe we all inhabit together?</p>
<p>I would now like to present a passage from my translation of the
Study Scene <sup><a href="#ref1">1</a></sup><span id="retA"> </span>in
<em>Faust</em> <em>Part 1</em> where Mephistopheles first appears to
Prof. Henry Faust. Listen for the Devil’s praise of Chaos after Faust’s
initial fear subsides.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>FAUST: So, therefore, who are you?</p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES: A party to that power that always wills the Evil, and
always creates the Good.</p>
<p>FAUST: What do you mean by this enigma?</p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES: I am the spirit that always denies. I have the right
to do so, since everything that comes into being deserves to be
annihilated. Of course, it would have been much better, had nothing
started in the first place. So therefore, everything that you call Sin,
Destruction, Evil, is my proper element.</p>
<p>FAUST: You call yourself a part, and yet you stand before me
whole?</p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES: I speak to you the humble truth. If humanity, this
insignificant world of fools takes itself to be the whole — well, I am a
part of that part that in the beginning* was <em>the Whole. A part of
the Darkness, Darkness that gave birth to Light. The proud Light that
now competes with Mother Night, concerning</em> her *more ancient rank
and place.</p>
<p>FAUST: Now I know your worthy duties. You cannot wreak destruction on
any grand scale, so you focus on the insignificant.</p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES: Freely, I admit it, I have hardly done a thing— If
you compare this idiotic world of "Somethingness" with that other world
of "Nothingness!" I had not realized how nearly futile were my efforts!
I sent tidal waves and storms and earthquakes, holocausts — when all was
done, the sea and land remained as quiet as before. And as for that
accursed trash, that progeny of animals and men, there is absolutely
nothing I can do with them! How many of them have I so far buried in the
earth! Yet fresh new blood is always circulating! On and on it goes! I
should be driven mad! Seeds by the thousands, bursting forth from Air,
from Water, even Earth, Dry! Moist! Warm! Cold! If I had not reserved
the element of Fire for myself, I would not have a thing to call my
own.</p>
<p>FAUST: So you set yourself against eternal action. Yes, against the
healing power of creation! How spitefully you clench your frozen Devil's
fist against it all— in vain! You marvelous Son of Chaos, look for
something new to do! <sup><a href="#ref2">2</a></sup> <span
id="retB"> </span><br />
</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>"<em>You marvelous Son of Chaos!" "A part of that part that in the
beginning was the whole."</em> That "<em>idiotic world of Somethingness
and that other world of Nothingness.</em>" "<em>Darkness that gave birth
to Light!"</em> Darkness, not defined as the absence of light but rather
the MOTHER of Light, i.e. <em>Mother Night</em>, more primeval and more
real that Light itself!! May I now formally rename Mother Night, Mother
Chaos! We shall mention her again— along with her sometime lover, Father
Time.<br />
</p>
<h3>Part I</h3>
<h3>The Epistemology of Goethean Science</h3>
<p>Before jumping from Goethe to present day chaos studies, let me first
acknowledge the pioneer in the field of establishing Goethe’s scientific
epistemology. In the early 1880’s, a young science student at the
<em>technische Holchschule</em> in Vienna was invited to edit Goethe’s
scientific writings for Kuerschner’s monumental publication of German
literature with special focus on Goethe’s works. The young scholar was
Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925) an Austrian by birth who became one of the
minor figures of German Idealist philosophy of the late 19<sup>th</sup>
Century.</p>
<p>As a philosopher, Steiner took dead aim on the fallacy of Kant’s
dogmatic belief in the complete subjectivity of human sense perception.
Steiner saw in Goethe someone who had never fallen into the
epistemological trap of Kant’s essential canonization of Rene Descartes
as the patron saint of subjectivism.</p>
<p>Steiner saw that Goethe made a clear distinction between the
inorganic sciences and the organic sciences. In a book published in
1886, <em>Grundlinien einer Erkenntnistheorie der Goetheschen
Weltanschauung</em> (English title<em>: A Theory of Knowledge Implicit
in Goethe’s World Conception</em>) Rudolf Steiner, in 1886 mind you,
clears the epistemological decks for a science of organics which I
believe is now ready to apprehend directly chaos and complexity by
training human intuition as a scientific mode of cognition.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"The sense world as inorganic does not arrive at individuality. Only
in its totality is it complete in itself. We must strive therefore, if
we would have a whole [for the inorganic world] to conceive of the
assemblage of the inorganic as a system. Such a system is the cosmos [or
universe]." A thorough understanding of the cosmos is the goal and ideal
of inorganic natural science. Every scientific endeavor which does not
attain to this is merely preparatory: a part of the whole, but not the
whole itself. <sup><a href="#ref3">3</a></sup> <span
id="retC"> </span></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>However, for Steiner, organic science must take as its
<em>starting</em> point the <em>endpoint</em> of the inorganic, which is
the absolute completeness or wholeness of the entire cosmos, the
wholeness of the entire universe— as its <em>point of
departure!</em></p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"Therefore a science of organics that sets out to be scientific in
the sense that physics or mechanics is scientific must show the Type as
the most universal form. Just as we trace a phenomenon in the inorganic
to a natural law, here in the organic we evolve a specific form from the
primal or archetypal form. <sup><a href="#ref4">4</a></sup> <span
id="retD"> </span></p>
<p>"An organics is possible which will be scientific in the strictest
sense just as mechanics is scientific. Only the method is different. The
method of mechanics is that of proof. But through this method of proof,
however, we can make no headway in the science of the organic. The type
does not require that under certain conditions a definite phenomenon
occur; the type does not fix anything in regard to a relationship of
elements mutually alien which confront each other. The type determines
only the conformity to law of its own <em>parts</em>. It does not point
beyond itself like a natural law does. <sup><a href="#ref5">5</a></sup>
<span id="retE"> </span></p>
<p>"Here the evolutionary method must replace the method of proof. Here
it is not to be established that the external conditions act upon one
another in this way and for that reason bring about a definite result,
but that a special form has been developed under definite external
conditions out of the type. This is the radical difference between
inorganic and organic science. This distinction is not made basic in any
other method of research so consistently as in Goethe’s. No one else
recognized as Goethe did, that an organics must be possible apart from
all vague mysticism, without teleology, without the assumption of
special creative thoughts." <sup><a href="#ref6">6</a></sup> <span
id="retF"> </span></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Goethe stated: "One should not see anything further behind the
phenomena: they themselves <em>are</em> the theory." <sup><a
href="#ref7">7</a></sup><span id="retG"> </span>Thus to Goethe, there
was no separation between the <em>form</em> of a theory and the
<em>content</em> of that theory. As Steiner puts it:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"the [organic] type does not determine the content in a merely formal
way as does the [inorganic] law… The task which is required of our mind
is to participate productively in creating the content while dealing
with the formal. A mode of thinking in which the form and content appear
in direct connection has always been called <em>intuitive</em>." <sup><a
href="#ref8">8</a></sup> <span id="retH"> </span></p>
<p>"…the mind must work with far greater intensity in apprehending the
[organic] type than in grasping the [inorganic] natural law. [The mind]
must create the content with the form. The mind must take upon itself an
activity which is the function of the senses in inorganic science and
which we call "Anschauung" (perception). The mind itself therefore must
be perceptive on this higher plane. Our power of judgment. ‘anschauende
Urteilskraft’, must perceive in thinking and think in
perceiving. <sup><a href="#ref9">9</a></sup> <span
id="retI"> </span></p>
<p>"As the type in organic nature replaces natural law in the inorganic,
so intuition replaces the power of judgment through proof. <sup><a
href="#ref10">10</a></sup> <span id="retJ"> </span></p>
<p>"Every single organism is the molding of the type in a special form.
It is an individuality which governs and determines itself from a center
outward. It is a totality complete in itself— which in inorganic nature
is true of the cosmos alone.<br />
The ideal of inorganic science is to grasp the totality of all phenomena
as a unitary system in order that we may approach each phenomenon with
the consciousness that we recognize it as a member [or part] of the
universe. In the organic science on the contrary, the ideal must be to
have in the utmost entirety possible in the type and its phenomenal
forms, that which we see evolving in the series of single beings.
Tracing the type back through all phenomena is here that which matters.
In inorganic science the system exists; in organic science the
comparison of each single form with the type.<br />
Spectral analysis and the perfecting of astronomy extend to the universe
the truths attained on the limited sphere of earth. Hereby these
[inorganic] sciences approach the first ideal. The second will be
fulfilled when the comparative method applied by Goethe is recognized in
it full scope." <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"

<h3>Part II</h3>
<h3>Bringing Chaos to Order</h3>
<p>As I now proceed to light this candle in front of the lectern, let us
move two centuries from Goethe and one century from Steiner to arrive at
contemporary chaos and complexity studies. But first, I need to focus on
chaos the way a physical scientist or mathematician would. What is chaos
to a mathematician? It is a non-linear equation with small terms that
iterate, or loop back or feedback into the main equation. Non-linear
equations are equations of interconnectedness, or of coupling where one
small term may feed back over and over again and plunge the solution
either into chaotic instability from positive feedback or else into
well-ordered stability from negative feedback.</p>
<p>What is chaos to a physicist? Exactly one century ago, Henri Poincare
discovered inherent <em>mathematical</em> chaos when he tried to solve
Newton’s equations of celestial mechanics for more than two bodies! You
see, with just two isolated bodies like earth and moon and no other
influences, the equations are solved perfectly and for all time. But
just introduce a 3<sup>rd</sup> body, let alone 4<sup>th</sup>,
5<sup>th</sup> or more and the equations cannot be solved because of the
reciprocal influences of each body on all the others. Their behavior can
only be <em>approximated</em> by what is called "perturbation theory."
But Poincare found that even a tiny, tiny perturbation, like the now
proverbial butterfly’s wing flapping in Hong Kong, could actually feed
back into the whole system, amplify and actually knock a planet out of
its orbit.</p>
<p>Can we bring chaos to order or are we just stuck teetering on the
edge of Occam’s Razor <sup><a href="#ref12">12</a></sup><span
id="retL">  </span>because we subconsciously harbor such a phobia
against chaos and complexity? Why are we so afraid to make that
epistemological leap from passive <em>approximation</em> of reality to
active intuitive <em>perception</em> of reality? If we don’t make that
leap of intuition, then all science beyond the inorganic will remain a
reductionistic rubble of useless information— except for technological
progress. I’m not knocking technology; but technology will answer no
questions beyond the closed system its own self-consistent and therefore
self-satisfied inorganic realm.</p>
<p>I think the first step beyond the inorganic realm is to realize that
the cosmos beyond the inorganic is <em>incalculable</em>. The
mathematician Kurt Goedel proved in 1931 that any mathematical system is
incomplete for a description of reality. That incompleteness is built
into every computer because every computer, now matter how big, must
approximate the numbers it crunches. And by so doing, it lops off a tiny
piece that might just feed back into the system and drive it to chaos,
unpredictable chaos, yet such a chaos that can equally and inevitably
spontaneously self-organize into a stable orderly system again.</p>
<p>Notice the word I emphasize: <em>approximate.</em> We live in an
approximate universe, don’t we? We don’t figure things exactly; we
approximate. We round off. We truncate. We have to. Otherwise, we could
never complete a single calculation and without completing calculations,
how could we have brought about the tremendous order we have in this our
corner of the universe? But what kind of order is this calculable
universe we have created? According to Rudolf Steiner, it’s the
<em>inorganic</em> universe, the one that keeps on expanding outward and
outward until it finally encompasses the entire universe itself in a
Grand Unification. Yet even beyond that unification there, he says, at
that infinite periphery, we take our point of departure for the science
of organics that Goethe pioneered.</p>
<p>If there is a figure living today who might be called a mythical son
of Mother Chaos and Father Time, it is the 82 year old Nobel laureate in
chemistry, Ilya Prigogine, at the University of Texas at Austin. Ilya
looks more like his father, because he speaks of the irreversibility of
time, the idea that time cannot be reversed; "time’s arrow" can only fly
in one direction: forward. Why? Because everything orderly in the
universe, including the order of the universe itself, i.e. cosmos, is
born out of chaos, chaos that can never be reproduced — except in some
approximate calculation. But isn’t that what we call memory or history?
Everything in the universe is so interconnected in its past and in its
present that the future is open to all possibilities and the past cannot
be recreated, except in memory because memory is, well, a reversible
approximation to an irreversible universe.</p>
<p>Prigogine shows how chemical systems far from equilibrium can create
order spontaneously and then, such order can dissipate again into chaos.
What we call order is a balance between two extremes of chaos, a
creative chaos and a destructive chaos. If you look at the candle flame
here, notice that the rather orderly flame is suspended between a
chemical chaos of wax igniting wick below and an swirling chaos of
heated air rising above. The point is that chaos enfolds order and order
in turn enfolds chaos again. Thus complexity can hide simplicity, but
that same simplicity can harbor a deeper chaos. Occam's Razor is not
only double-edged, it may shatter to bits if we don’t balance properly
on its edge.</p>
<p>There is another living, mythical son of Mother Chaos and Father
Time, a physicist who also works in Austin, Texas. He takes more after
his "mother." Hal Puthoff at the Institute for Advanced Studies (IAS) in
Austin is completing the work of the late Russian physicist Andrei
Sakarhov in the field of quantum physics called "Zero-Point Energy."
What is ZPE? It is the energy of the vacuum, the <em>infinite</em>
energy of the vacuum, as predicted by early quantum physics and
experimentally verified today. But isn't the vacuum supposed to be
empty? Void of energy? Zero energy to be exact? Well, in the approximate
fictional inorganic universe, it is, but in the exact intuitive organic
universe, the vacuum is anything but empty. In fact, the vacuum is the
source of all creative chaos, some of which spontaneously ordered the
universe we inhabit even to the point that we, like Faust, become bored
with and depressed by it.</p>
<p>Are you feeling uncertain about all of this? Well, perhaps you should
be. Is the glass of water half empty or half full? For one person's
uncertainty is another person's freedom. And it is directly due to
Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle that ZPE has been recognized. Yet,
despite all that uncertainty and unpredictability, don’t we all live in
a certain, predictable deterministic universe? I believe we all do. The
question is: who does the determining?</p>
<h3>Part III</h3>
<h3>Looking Phenomena Right in the I</h3>
<p>Who am I anyway? I mean, how far out do I extend? Am I really bounded
by this limited body I seem to inhabit? All around me, outside of me
seem to exist objects and beings who are not I. Myself the rest of the
universe. Inner, intensive Subject—outer, extensive Object. Forever cut
off from each other? Yet if we are all part of this inorganic "Grand
Unification" scheme that leads us out to the ends of the universe — only
to take an intuitive leap to organic wholeness and incalculable
completeness — might we then not then conclude that whatever constitutes
my self, my I, my ego and your self, your I, your ego, is out there,
too? Is this pure solipsism on the road to megalomania or are we simply
anthropomorphizing the universe?</p>
<p>Admittedly and undoubtedly, the Cartesian/Kantian dualism that
defines the epistemology of modern Western science degenerates into
solipsism whenever it attempts to answer "ultimate questions" such as:
"Who am I?" or "Where do we all come from?" The big problem with such
questions is the explicit self-reference which contradicts the mutually
exclusive logic of the rigid dualism. In fact, I might characterize such
logic as the logic of NON-self reference precisely because it "excludes
the middle," which is the self-reference to the human thinker who
created the dualism in the first place!</p>
<p>In science, any biological theory of evolution or astrophysical
cosmogony <em>implicitly</em> asks such self-referential questions.
Solipsism then arises if the paradox of self-reference is either ignored
or denied. Science then operates under a "don’t ask; don’t tell" policy
with regard to these questions but the price of denial is that science
in its solemn solipsism ends up subjectively anthropomorphizing the
entire universe — a phenomenon I call "post-modern scientific
animism."</p>
<p>Goethe did not fall into this trap for the simple reason that he saw
no reason to build it in the first place. Goethe realized the scientific
experiment itself as the mediator or fulcrum balancing Subject and
Object, thus giving equal ontological status to both the subjective and
the objective. His insight prefigured the observer-created reality of
quantum physics by more than a century, albeit even quantum physics
itself is still trapped by and large in the same Cartesian "cage" that
still keeps other sciences today in epistemological captivity.</p>
<p>Goethe avoided this problem by looking into the phenomena directly,
without the "animism" of projecting analogous phenomena which <em>ipso
facto</em> were not directly perceptible to the scientist. E.g. Goethe
would reject both the wave and the particle aspects of light because
such phenomena are conceptually inferred and not directly perceived by
unaided human senses. Goethe saw the Aristotelian "immanence" in the
object because for him the object included the subject. Therefore, he
rejected the object’s Platonic "transcendence," which demands not only
the mutual exclusion of object from subject, but also leaves the subject
no choice but to anthropomorphize the object.</p>
<p>But maybe this anthropomorphizing is not a bad thing. Is there
anything in the Platonic/Cartesian dualism that we can and ought to
anthropomorphize — because it points to the most human part of us? How
about the very activity we engage in to anthropomorphize
<em>anything</em>? How about the activity of human thinking itself,
expressed in our subjective-objective world by the phenomenon of light —
the one "object" which we may look right in the "I" and have it look
right back at us? If a photon is an idealized, inferred Platonic object,
then is not the activity of "seeing the light," or "photonizing" by the
Platonic subject the very anthropomorphic activity of idealizing and
inferring the photon in the first place? Subject and Object may be
forever separate in their Platonic transcendence, but they are two sides
of the same coin to be spent in the Aristotelian realm of Goethe’s pure
phenomenology.</p>
<p>In the field of optics, Fermat’s Principle states that light travels
between two points in the quickest time possible. Max Planck said this
about light:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Thus the photons which constitute a ray of light behave like
intelligent human beings: out of all possible curves, they always select
the one which will take them most quickly to their goal."</em> <sup><a
href="#ref13">13</a></sup><span id="retM"> </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is called the principle of "least action." And another alias for
the photon is: "quantum of action." Now let me quote Goethe:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"The eye was made by the light, for the light, so that the inner
light may emerge to meet the outer light."</em> <sup><a
href="#ref14">14</a></sup> <span id="retN"> </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Look at these human attributes projected on to light: it behaves
intelligently; it has a definite purpose; it makes choices; it even
creates the eyeball itself. Yes, this is solipsism, this Platonic
anthropomorphizing of light? But I believe we are forced to do so only
because of the Cartesian/Kantian dualism which underlies our
<em>inorganic</em> conception of the universe. And that, according to
Steiner, is the great value of the dualistic thinking. It gets us off
our localized terrestrial duffs and out there into the wide open
universal frontier of the entire Cosmos!</p>
<p>So, what if we were to stop being so miserly and give back to that
objective world the "I" that we hoard so deeply within our subjective
Kantian fortress? What if we were to lend some of that subjectivity to
the phenomena of that external world so that they might "observe" us
humans as the "Selbst an sich" (Self-in-itself) just as Kant observed
the object as "Ding an sich" ("Thing in itself"). A Goethean science
would then balance these two polarities according to the title of
Goethe’s essay: "The Experiment as Mediator between Subject and
Object."</p>
<p>Just as we anthropomorphize light into an object, so does light
itself enlighten us as subjects— at least as far as we think. The key,
to me, is expressed in Goethe’s dying words: "More light!" <sup><a
href="#ref15">15</a></sup> <span id="retO"> </span><br />
 <br />
 <br />
</p>
<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
<p>Like this candle flame, I am standing in the midst of order, but I am
also standing on what I used to believe was a totally empty and void
vacuum. Instead, quantum physics tells me about the infinite energy and
potentiality of this teeming vacuum of chaos— below me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Darkness that gave birth to light; the proud light that now
competes with Mother night concerning her more ancient rank and
place."</em> <sup><a href="#ref16">16</a></sup><span
id="retP"> </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Above me is this vast, mostly orderly, I hope, spatial universe that
came into existence out of that primeval chaos. But it and I could
plunge into chaos at any time. I am truly standing on the edge of
Occam's Razor and it is precarious, indeed. And if there is a simple
explanation for it, then complex chaos lurks on either side of that
simplicity and order.</p>
<p>ZPE tells me that emptiness is not a constituent of the vacuum, so
might emptiness then be the constituent factor of my own subjective
mind, my mental processes? Following Descartes, we closed ourselves off
from that teeming fullness of the vacuum and created a little island of
orderly emptiness we could call our own: "I think; therefore I am." It
is my subjective mind that is the vacuum, not the objective universe.
But in order to survive, my subjective mind had to shut down against
that objective chaos "out" there and "under" here and "over" there, so
that I could recognize some stable and orderly semblance of myself "in"
here. I made myself internal to the external world. But only because I
used that approximating mind— useful for this inorganic universe— to get
stabilized and orderly "in" here. But couldn't I equally now overcome
that duality? Especially since I created it in the first place with my
thinking? Can't I uncreate it? Can't I share some of that miserly self
I've hoarded in here, within this empty subjective mind for so long,
share it with the universe, the external world I so egotistically
abandoned in following Descartes and Kant?</p>
<p>Or might I trust myself, not as a mere reflective thinker of empty
finite approximate thoughts <em>about</em> the universe, but as a
conscious active participant <em>immanent</em> <em>in</em> the very
process of everything that is happening now, has ever happened in the
irreversible past and will happen in the open-ended and uncertain
future? A co-worker with all my fellow human beings in the ever evolving
process of that universe "out there" yet equally "in here?" Fractal
complexity tells me that reality is independent of scale.
Self-similarity at the microscopic level; self-similarity at the
macroscopic level. The ancient Hermetic saying: "As above; so below!"
How true today with fractal chaos! But also equally true: "As out there
in the objective universe, so in here in my subjective I."</p>
<p>We’ve heard it said that we human beings are all "drops in the Ocean
of God." But Goethe, Steiner, Prigogine, et al. remind us of the
converse truth as well: The Ocean of God exists equally in every drop,
in every last drop of us.</p>
<p>Here are the last 4 lines of Goethe’s <em>Faust</em>, part 2, the
Mystical Chorus singing:</p>
<p><em>Alles vergaengliche ist nur ein Gleichnis.</em><br />
<em>Das Unzulaengliche, wird hier’s Ereignis</em><br />
<em>Das Unbeschreibliche, hier ist’s getan</em><br />
<em>Das ewig-weibliche, zieht uns hinan.</em> <sup><a

wholeness of the universe.</p>

more and ever more.</em> <sup><a href="#ref18">18</a></sup><span

Scene is part of my own one-act stage play adaptation in which I have
translated a few scenes of Faust Part 1 and then tied them together by
writing monologues in the character of Mephistopheles. I have tried to
be as literal as possible in my direct translation of Goethe's German
text, but simultaneously had to tune my playwright's ear to the more
naturalistic speech patterns and rhythms of modern American stage
actors. Furthermore, the play itself makes Mephisto more central than
Faust as a character. Hence the more expository and naturalistic tone of
my translation of Mephisto's lines. In short, Mephisto's imitation of a
human being becomes just as good as Faust's actual status as a human
being -- a device which shames and taunts Faust much more intensely in
my one act play than of course occurs in Goethe's entire opus.</p>

<p>[^12^](#retL)<span id="ref12"> </span> Occam's (or Ockham's) Razor, a
heuristic principle of modern scientific epistemology first attributed
to Nominalist theologian William of Occam (1284-1349), student of Duns
Scotus and a veritable pioneer of Kantian epistemology 400 years before
Kant. William felt that the positing of objective universals beyond the
subjectivity of human perception was an exercise in multiplying
unnecessary and thus unprovable metaphysical entities. One of his
statements: "Frustra fit per plura quod potest fieri per pauciora." (tr.
"It is vain to do with more what can be done with less.") has been
appropriated by modern science to mean that if 2 scientific theories
compete to explain the same phenomenon, then the simpler one is to be
chosen, because it will inevitably contain less unprovable "metaphysical
baggage" than the more complicated one. Occam's Razor has also been
called the "law of parsimony" in that it strives to reduce phenomena
down to their simpl est parts. For that reason, staunch scientific
reductionists enshrine the principle as a law, while more holistically
inclined phenomenalists recognize that Nature is often times more
objectively complex than our subjective oversimplifications of that
reality .</p>
