RE: [Adrian\'s Way to a Universal Basic Income](https://southerncrossreview.org/143/adrian-ubi.html)

Beautiful story, shared. I know Robert Anton Wilson wrote about basic
income in the 70s. I\'m all for it but must admit I haven\'t understood
the 3fold path yet, but have grown up in a rebellious socialist,
communist, anarchist environment in my teens. Only I couldn\'t let go of
my opium for the people, religion, that stopped me to go further in that
direction.

RE: [Breathe](https://southerncrossreview.org/141/hemsley-breathe.html)

Hello,..

I\'ve often written poems myself,  for family weddings and loved ones,..

This however, resonated with me, and is absolutely beautiful\...took me
back to times gone by, was deeply touching, emotional and made my heart
smile..

Thank you for sharing something so lovely..

embrace!!

Dear Sir or Madame,

I just find deplorable the illustration you printed along with Borges\'

RE: [Love in the Life of Spies -- Chapter 1](https://southerncrossreview.org/151/love-spies-1.html)

Dear Frank,

thank you for the sequel. I cannot tie Frau Clement & Herr Jacks to this
chapter yet, but I know the story will nicely come together eventually.

Cheers, Norbert Hanny

RE: [The Gospel According to Mary Magdalene](https://southerncrossreview.org/151/gospel-mary-3.html)

Thank you for the Gospel of Mary Magdalene. I have never heard about
***Papyrus Berolinensis 8502***. I tried to understand this teaching,
it would be nice to see what these 7 challenges of the soul really mean
and how these are connected to any other teachings of the Christ:

1. darkness
2. desire
3. ignorance
4. excitement of death
5. kingdom of the flesh
6. foolish wisdom of flesh
7. wrathful wisdom.

Any ideas?

RE: [Tango](https://southerncrossreview.org/147/valenzuela-tango-eng.html) by Luisa Valenzuela

I love the story Tango by Luisa Valenzuela, thank you for publishing it.
It says so much about gender, economics, the pull of music and dance.
Great story.
