Blues is associated with sad memories and, more importantly, hope. But
hope is often enabled by "eternal rest" in a heavenly nirvana after
death. No more slavery, no more suffering, no more pain. But
reincarnation tells a different story. Death yes, but a merely temporary
one in order to lick your wounds, get a grip and begin again on a long,
difficult path of development.

So the Blues of these verses is a kind of wake-up call, that it ain\'t
so easy after all, that the quest is just beginning. And it\'s certainly
not as boring as "eternal rest". Start with Canto I. If you think it\'s
worthwhile, continue, there are twelve. If not, don\'t forget to wave
goodbye.
