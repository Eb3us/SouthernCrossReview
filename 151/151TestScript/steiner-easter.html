<p class="intro">Now let us think about the Easter Festival in connection with the
Mystery of Golgotha. As you know, Easter is a movable festival — every
year it is celebrated on a different date. Why is the date variable?
Because it is determined, not by terrestrial but by celestial
conditions. It is fixed by asking: When does spring begin? March 21st is
always the beginning of spring and the Easter Festival takes place after
this. Then there is a period of waiting until the moon becomes full,
then another pause until the following Sunday, and Easter falls on the
first Sunday after the first full moon after the beginning of spring.
The first full moon can be on 22nd March, in which case Easter is very
early; or the first full moon can be a whole twenty-nine days after 21st
March. If, for example, there is a full moon on 19th March, spring has
not yet begun and then after some twenty-eight days the moon is again
full; the Easter Festival in that year will fall on the next Sunday —
quite late in April.</p>
<p>Now why has the Easter Festival been fixed according to conditions in
the heavens? This is connected with what I have been telling you. In
earlier times men knew that the moon and the Sun have an influence upon
everything that exists on the Earth.</p>
<p>Think of a growing plant. (<em>Sketch on the blackboard</em>.) If you
want to grow a plant, you take a tiny seed and lay it in the soil. The
whole plant, the whole life of the plant is compressed into this tiny
seed. What comes out of this seed? First, the root. The life expands
into the root. But then it contracts again and grows, still in a state
of contraction, into a stem. Then it expands and the leaves come and
then the blossom. Then there is again contraction into the seed and the
seed waits until the following year. In the plant, therefore, we see a
process of expansion — contraction, expansion — contraction.</p>
<p>Whenever the plant expands, it is the Sun which draws out the leaf or
the blossom; whenever the plant contracts (in the seed or the stem) the
contraction is due to the forces of the moon. Between the leaves, the
moon is working. So that when we take a plant with spreading leaves and
root, we can say, beginning with the seed: moon — then Sun — again moon
— again Sun — again moon, and so forth ... with the moon at the end of
the process. In every plant we see Sun forces and moon forces working in
alternation. In a field of growing plants we behold the deeds of Sun and
moon. I told you that the fashioning and shaping of the physical human
being when he comes into the world, is dependent on the moon; inner
forces which make it possible for him to transform his own character,
come from the Sun. I told you this when we were speaking about the
Mystery of Golgotha.</p>
<p>In earlier times these things were known but they have all been
forgotten. People asked themselves: When is there present in spring the
influence that does most to promote the thriving and growth of
vegetation? It is when the influences of Sun and moon together are at
their strongest. This is the case when the rays of the first full moon
after the beginning of spring shine down upon the Earth, adding strength
to the rays of the Sun. The influences of Sun and moon are mutually
enhanced when the springtime Sun at its strongest works in conjunction
with the moon which is also at its strongest when its cycle of four
weeks has been completed. The time for Easter, therefore, is the Sunday
— the day dedicated to the Sun — after the first full moon of spring.
The date of the Easter Festival was based on knowledge relating to the
winter solstice and the subsequent beginning of spring.</p>
<p>Now the Easter Festival did not begin in the Christian era; before
the rise of Christianity there was an old pagan festival — the Adonis
Festival as it was called. What was this Adonis Festival? It was
instituted by the Mysteries — those places for the cultivation of art,
learning and religion which I have described to you recently. And Adonis
was personified in a kind of effigy or image, representing the
spirit-and-soul in man. It was known, furthermore, that man's
spirit-and-soul is united with the whole universe. The ancient pagan
peoples took account of spiritual conditions and celebrated this Adonis
Festival in the autumn. The old Easter Festival — which in a certain way
resembled our own — fell in the <em>autumn</em>. </p>
<p>The Adonis Festival was celebrated in the following way. — The image
of the eternal, immortal part of man was submerged in a pond, or in the
sea if the place happened to be near the coast, and left there for three
days, to the accompaniment of songs of mourning and lamentation. The
submerging of the image was the occasion of solemnities resembling those
which might be associated with the death of a member of a very united
family. It was essentially a ceremony which had to do with death, and it
always took place on the day of the week we now call Friday. The name
“Karfreitag” originated when the custom found its way into the Germanic
regions of Middle Europe. “Kar” comes from “Chara” (Old High German)
meaning mourning. It was therefore the Friday of sadness or
mourning.</p>
<p>So little is known of these things to-day that in England this Friday
is called “Good” Friday, whereas in olden time it was the Friday of
Death, the Friday of mourning and lamentation. It was a festival
connected with death, dedicated to Adonis. And in places where there was
no water, an artificial pond was contrived into which the image or
effigy was plunged and taken out after three days, i.e., after the
Sunday.</p>
<p>The image was taken out of the water amid songs of jubilation and
rejoicing. For three days, therefore, the people were filled with deep
sorrow and after these three days with ecstatic joy. And the theme of
their songs of jubilation was always: “The God has come to us
again!”</p>
<p>What did this Festival signify? — I must emphasize again that
originally it was celebrated in the <em>autumn</em>. On other occasions
I have told you that when the human being dies, the physical body is
laid aside. Those who have been bereaved mourn in their own way for the
dead with solemnities not unlike those which accompanied the submerging
of the Adonis image. But there is something else as well. For a period
of three days after death, the human being looks back upon his earthly
life. His physical body has been laid aside but his ether-body is still
with him. The ether-body expands and expands and finally dissolves into
the universe. The human being then lives on in the astral body and the
“I.”</p>
<p>The purpose of those who instituted the Adonis Festival was to make
men realize that the human being does not only die but after three days
comes to life again in the spiritual world. And in order that this might
be brought every year to consciousness, the Adonis Festival was
instituted. In the autumn it was said: Lo, nature is dying; the trees
lose their leaves, the earth is covered with snow; winds are cold and
biting; the earth loses her fertility and looks just as the physical
human being looks in death. We must wait until spring for the earth to
come to life again, whereas the human being comes to life again in soul
and spirit after three days. Of this men must be made conscious! ... A
festival of Death was therefore followed immediately by a festival of
Resurrection! — But this festival took place in the autumn — the season
when it is easy to realize the contrast between man and nature. Nature
is about to consolidate her life; she will lie dead through the whole
winter. But in contrast to nature, man lives on after death in the
spiritual world. When nature sheds her leaves it is covered with snow,
when cold winds blow, then is the time to make man conscious: You are
different from nature, inasmuch as when you die, after three days you
live again!</p>
<p>It was a most beautiful festival, celebrated through long ages of
antiquity. People gathered together at the places of the Mysteries for
the period of this festival, joining in the songs of mourning; and then,
on the third day, the consciousness came to them that every soul, every
“I” and every astral body come to life again in the spiritual world
three days after death. Their attention was turned away from the
physical world and their hearts and minds were drawn to the spiritual
world. The very season of the year played a part, for in those days the
festival did not take place in the spring when the people who lived on
the land were occupied with other tasks. The old Easter Festival, the
Adonis Festival, was celebrated when the fruit had been harvested and
the grape-picking was over, when winter was approaching. It was the
appropriate season for an awakening in the Spirit, and so the Adonis
Festival was celebrated. The name varied in different territories but
the festival was celebrated in all ancient religions. For all ancient
religions spoke in this way of the immortality of the human soul.</p>
<p>Now in the first centuries of the Christian era itself, the Easter
Festival was not celebrated at the time it is celebrated to-day; not
until the third or fourth century did it become customary to celebrate
Easter in the spring. But by that time men had lost all understanding of
the spiritual world; they had eyes only for nature, concerned themselves
only with nature. And so they said: It is not possible to celebrate
resurrection in the autumn, when nothing comes to life! — They no longer
knew that the human being comes to life again in the spiritual world,
and so they said: In the autumn there is no resurrection; the snow
covers everything. Whereas in the spring, all things burst into life.
Spring, therefore, is the proper time for the Easter Festival. — This
kind of thinking was already an outcome of materialism, although it was
a materialism which still looked up to the heavens and fixed the Easter
Festival according to Sun and moon. By the third and fourth centuries of
the Christian era, materialism was already in evidence but at least it
still looked out into the universe; it was not the “earth-worm”
materialism which has eyes only for the Earth and has been described as
such because the earthworms live under the soil and only come up when it
rains. And so it is with the people of modern times; they look simply at
what is on the Earth. When the Easter Festival began to be celebrated in
the spring, even materialism still believed that the myriad stars have
an influence upon human beings. But from the fifteenth century onward,
that too was forgotten. At the time when the Easter Festival was
transferred to the spring, certain attempts were being made by the
Christians to sweep away the ancient truths. — I mentioned this when we
were speaking about the Mystery of Golgotha. — By the eighth or ninth
centuries, men had not the remotest inkling that Christ's Coming was in
any way connected with the Sun.</p>
<p>In the fourth century there were two Emperors, one a little later
than the other. The first was Constantine, the founder of Constantinople
and an extremely vain man. He ordered a certain treasure that had once
been brought from Troy to Rome to be transferred to Constantinople and
buried in the ground under a pillar which had upon it a statue of
Apollo, the old pagan god; then he sent to the East for wood said to
have been taken from the Cross of Christ, and caused a wreath to be
carved, with rays springing from it. But in the figure crowned with this
wooden wreath, people were expected to behold Constantine! And so from
then onward, veneration was paid to Constantine, standing there on the
pillar that had been erected over the precious Roman treasure. By
external measures, you see, he brought it about that men ceased to know
anything about cosmic secrets, about the fact that Christ is connected
with the Sun.</p>
<p>The other Emperor, Julian, had received instruction in the Mysteries
which still survived, although under very difficult conditions. Later on
they were exterminated altogether by the Emperor Justinian but for
centuries already their existence had been highly precarious. They were
not wanted; Christianity was their bitter enemy. Julian the Emperor,
however, had received instruction in the Mysteries and he knew: There is
not only <em>one</em> Sun, but there are <em>three</em> Suns. This
announcement caused an uproar, for it was a secret of the Mysteries.</p>
<p>When you look at the Sun you see a whitish-yellowish orb or body — it
is the physical Sun. But this Sun has a soul: it is the second Sun. And
then there is the third Sun: the spiritual Sun. Like man, the Sun has
body, soul and spirit. Julian spoke of three
Suns <em>and</em> maintained that in Christianity men should be taught:
Christ came from the Sun and then, as Sun Being, entered into the man
Jesus.</p>
<p>Now the Churches did not wish this knowledge to be in the possession
of men. The Churches did not want the real facts about Christ Jesus to
come to light, but only such knowledge as was authorized by them. Julian
the Emperor was treacherously murdered on a journey to Asia, in order
that the world might be rid of him. That is why Julian is always known
as the Apostate, the heretic: Julian the Heretic! He desired that the
connection between Christianity and the ancient truths should be
maintained, for he thought: It will be easier for Christianity to make
progress if it contains the truths of the ancient wisdom than if men are
allowed to believe only what the priests tell them. So you see, at the
time when the Easter Festival was transferred to the spring, knowledge
that this festival is connected with resurrection still survived.
Although knowledge of the resurrection of man had been lost, the
resurrection of nature continued to be celebrated in a festival. But
even that has been forgotten in places where Easter is still celebrated
without any inkling of what it really signifies; and to-day people have
come to the point of asking: Why need Sun and moon have anything to do
with the date of Easter? If Easter were always to fall on the first
Sunday in April, book-keeping would be greatly simplified! The
suggestion, therefore, is that the date should be determined by
commercial considerations! ... As a matter of fact, the people who
clamour for this are more honest than the others who insist that
conditions in the heavens shall still be the determining factor, without
having the slightest notion <em>o</em>f what this means. Those who
say from their own point of view that conditions in the heavens need not
be taken into account are really the more honest. But the sad thing is
that people can only be honest about this because they know nothing of
the real connections. What we have to do to-day is to emphasize that
the <em>Spiritual</em> must always be the decisive factor!</p>
<p>And so in olden times People waited for the last full moon after the
beginning of autumn and celebrated the Adonis Festival on the preceding
Sunday. Sun and moon were taken into account but it was known that
conditions are quite different, indeed the reverse, when snow will soon
be falling from the heavens. The old Easter Festival, the Adonis
Festival, always took place between the end of September and the end of
October. This was the best time to be reminded of the resurrection of
man, because at that season of the year there was no question of a
resurrection in nature. This early festival, therefore, was known to be
connected with Death and also with Resurrection ... but this knowledge
too has been lost.</p>
<p>It is important to be reminded of the ancient significance of these
festivals, for we have again to find the way to the Spirit. We must not
celebrate Christmas and Easter thoughtlessly but realize that such
festivals have deep meaning.</p>
<p>Now the world cannot be turned topsy-turvy; nobody would wish the
Easter Festival to be transferred to the autumn. But it is good to be
reminded that when a man dies, he lays aside his physical body and looks
back upon his earthly life; then he lays aside the ether-body and comes
to life again in the spiritual world as a being of spirit-and-soul. Such
knowledge can greatly deepen our understanding of the Mystery of
Golgotha.</p>
<p>The Mystery of Golgotha presents in external reality what was always
presented in an image at the Adonis Festival. The men of antiquity had
an image; Christians have the actual, historical event. But in the
historical event there are certain points of resemblance with the
imagery used in olden times. At the Adonis Festival the image of Adonis
was submerged and raised after three days. It was a true Easter
Festival. — But then, what had once been presented as an image, came to
pass as an actual happening. The Christ was in Jesus. He died and rose
to life again. And at Easter now, this is all that is remembered.</p>
<p>In a way, there is a good side to this. For why was an image always
set before the people at the Adonis Festival? It was because they needed
something that their senses could perceive. Although they still looked
at the universe in a spiritual way, in the material world they needed an
image. But when Christ had passed through the Mystery of Golgotha there
was to be no image; people were called upon to remember purely <em>in
the Spirit</em> what had happened at that time. The Easter Festival was
to be an essentially <em>spiritual</em> celebration. Men must no longer
make a pagan image but perform the act of remembrance entirely within
the soul. It was thought — and Mysteries still existed in the days of
the Christ Jesus — that the Easter Festival would in this way be
spiritualised.</p>
<p>Think once again of the old Adonis Festival. It is impossible in
present-day Europe to realise what such festivals meant to the ancient
pagan peoples. You would say: This is only an image — and those at least
who had been initiated in the Mysteries would have regarded it as such.
But every year the statue of the god was displayed to large numbers of
the people and then submerged. This gave rise to what is known as
fetishism. A statue of such a kind was a fetish, an idol, a god; worship
of such an object was called fetishism — and that of course is
undesirable. And yet in a certain respect, an element of the same
tendency has remained in Christianity, for the Monstrance with the
Sanctissimum, the Sacred Host, is worshiped in Catholicism as the Real
Christ. It is said that the Bread and the Wine are transformed, in the
physical sense too, into the Body and Blood of Christ. This is a
survival, not of enlightened pagan wisdom which beheld the Spiritual
behind every sense-phenomenon, but of the fetish-worship in which the
statue was taken to be the god himself.</p>
<p>Nowadays — unless examples have occurred in one's own experience — it
is almost impossible to picture the intensity with which people believed
in these images of the god; I myself once knew a very clever professor —
all such men are clever, only modern science does not lead them to the
Spiritual. The man was a Russian and he made a journey from Japan across
Siberia. In the middle of Siberia he became aware of a deep uneasiness,
he felt lonely and forsaken. And what did he do? Something that none of
you, nor indeed any Westerner, would ever think of doing. But although
this man was very learned, he was half-Asiatic. He made a figure of a
god out of wood, took it with him on his further travels and prayed to
it fervently. When I knew him his nerves were in a terrible state; the
illness had come from worshiping his wooden god. It is difficult for you
to conceive what it means to worship an idol of this kind!</p>
<p>Now the Mysteries still existing at the time of the founding of
Christianity were deeply concerned as to how men might be led to the
Spiritual. And so what in earlier epochs had been presented before their
eyes in the Adonis Festival was now to be revived in remembrance only,
by prayer. This was the intention ... but instead of becoming spiritual,
everything became materialistic; it was all externalised, made formal.
By the third and fourth centuries A.D. all kinds of emotions were
aroused in the people on “Kar” Friday; the priests offered up prayers;
and at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, the hour at which Christ is said to
have died, the bells stopped ringing. Everything was still. And then,
outwardly again, just as in the old Adonis Festival, the Crucifix, a
figure of Christ on the Cross, was buried; at a later period it was
covered with a veil. After three days came Easter — the festival of
Resurrection. But the manner and form of the celebration are the same,
fundamentally, as in the old Adonis Festival. The form of the
celebration indicates that little by little the souls of men were coming
under the authority of Rome.</p>
<p>In many districts, for example in the place where my youth was spent
— whether it happens here I do not know — it is customary on the Friday
before Easter for the boys to gather around the Church with rattles and
musical toys, singing the words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Wir rätschen, wir rätschen am Dom.<br />
Die Glocken ziehen nach Rom</em>. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We rattle, we rattle around the church</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But the bells point to Rome.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Everything, you see, pointed towards Rome, especially at the time of
the Easter Festival.</p>
<p>Men of the present age must emerge from materialism into a life of
spiritual knowledge; they must learn to understand things in a spiritual
way, above all such things as the Easter Festival. Every year at the
Easter Festival we can remind ourselves that the day of mourning,
the <em>Chara</em>, commemorates the departure of the human being from
the physical world; for three days after death he is still looking back
on the physical world; then he lays aside his ether-body as a second
corpse; but then in his astral body and “I,” he rises to life again in
the spiritual world. This, too, is part of the act of remembrance,
although it would be barbarous to expect songs of jubilation three days
after a death has occurred. And yet we can be reminded of these songs of
jubilation when we think of the immortality of the human soul and of
how, after three days, the soul comes to live again in the spiritual
world.</p>
<p>There is a connection between the Easter Festival and every human
death. At every human death our attitude should be that although
mourning is inevitable, the Easter Festival is near, when we shall
remember that every soul after death rises to life again in the
spiritual world. — You know, of course, of the festival which
commemorates the death of all human beings: it is called the Festival of
All Souls and is still celebrated in the autumn. When the knowledge of
its connection with the Easter Festival had been lost, the Day of All
Saints, All Saints' Day, was placed before it in the calendar. But All
Souls' Day should, in reality, be celebrated as the day of the Dead and
the Easter Festival as the day of Resurrection. They belong together
although they are separated now by the span of nearly half a year! From
the calendar as it now stands it is often impossible to understand what
really lies behind these festivals.</p>
<p>But remember: everything on Earth is in reality directed by the
Heavens. People are surprised if it ever snows at Easter because that is
the time for the plants to be sprouting, not for snow. They are
surprised because they feel that the Easter Festival is intended to
commemorate the resurrection, the immortality of the human soul.</p>
<p>This attitude and knowledge make the whole Easter Festival into a
deep, heart-felt experience, reminding those who celebrate it of
something that is connected with man himself and with his life as the
seasons of the year run their course. The only kind of connection with
the yearly seasons to which any thought is given to-day is that in the
winter one puts on a winter coat and in the summer a summer coat, that
one sweats in the summer and shivers in the winter — all purely material
considerations. What is not known is that with the coming of spring,
spiritual forces are actively at work drawing forth the plants from the
Earth and that with the coming of autumn, spiritual forces are again in
operation as forces of destruction. When this is understood men will see
life and being in the whole of nature. Much of what is said about nature
to-day is nonsense. People see a plant, tear it out of the soil and set
about studying botany ... because they know nothing about the
essentials. If I were to tear out a hair and proceed to describe it,
this would be nonsense, because the hair cannot arise of itself; it must
be growing on a human being or an animal. Nothing that you might apply
to any part of a lifeless stone will make a hair grow from it. For a
hair to grow, life must be at the source. The plants are like the hair
of the Earth, because the Earth is a living being. And just as man needs
the air in order to live, so does the Earth need the stars with their
spirituality; the Earth breathes in the spiritual forces of the stars in
order to live. Man moves over the Earth and the Earth moves through the
Cosmos, lives in the Cosmos. The Earth is a living being.</p>
<p>This remembrance at least can still come to us at the Easter Festival
— the remembrance that the Earth herself is a living Being. When the
Earth brings forth the plants she is young, just as the child is young
when the soft hair grows. The old man loses his hair just as in autumn
the Earth loses the plants. It is only that the Earth's life runs its
course in a different rhythm: youth in the spring, age in the autumn;
youth again, age again — whereas in man the periods are much longer.
Everything in the universe is alive. In thinking of the Easter Festival
and with the spectacle of newly awakening nature before us, we can say:
Death is not ever-present; beings have to pass through death
but <em>life</em> is the essential reality. Life is everywhere
victorious over death. The Easter Festival is there to remind us of this
victory and to give us strength. If people gain this kind of strength it
will enable them to set about the improvement of external conditions
with insight and intelligence — not in the way that is usual at the
present time. First and foremost we need Spiritual Science in order
again to ally ourselves with the spiritual world — which is a world of
life, not of death.</p>
<p>In this sense I hope that the Easter Festival will be as full of
beauty in your souls as are the spring flowers growing out of the Earth.
— After Easter we shall meet together again and speak about scientific
matters.</p>
<p>At the Easter Festival, then, let us feel: People can go to their
work with fresh courage and with joy. Even if in these days there are
not many opportunities of finding joy in daily work, perhaps here it is
different! In any case I wanted to say these things to you to-day and to
wish you a beautiful Easter in the sense of the knowledge born from
Spiritual Science.</p>
