<h1>Nuclear Armageddon Games in Ukraine</h1>
<p><img src="einstein-atom.jpg" class="a" /></p>

<main>
<p>In 1946, Albert Einstein shot off a telegram to several hundred
American leaders and politicians warning that the “unleashed power of
the atom has changed everything save our modes of thinking and we thus
drift toward unparalleled catastrophe.” Einstein’s forecast remains
prescient. Nuclear calamity still knocks.</p>
<p>Even prior to Vladimir Putin’s bloody invasion of Ukraine, the threat
of a nuclear confrontation between NATO and Russia was intensifying.
After all, in August 2019, President Donald Trump formally withdrew the
U.S. from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, long heralded as
a pillar of arms control between the two superpowers.</p>
<p><span id="anchor"></span>“Russia is solely responsible for the
treaty’s demise,” <a
href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-49198565"><strong>declared</strong></a> Secretary
of State Mike Pompeo following the announcement. “With the full support
of our NATO allies, the United States has determined Russia to be in
material breach of the treaty and has subsequently suspended our
obligations under the treaty.” No evidence of that breach was offered,
but in Trump World, no evidence was needed.</p>
<p>Then, on February 21st of this year, following the Biden
administration’s <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/31/us/politics/us-russia-nuclear-treat.html"><strong>claims</strong></a> that
Russia was no longer abiding by its obligations under the New START
treaty, the last remaining nuclear arms accord between the two nations,
Putin <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/21/world/europe/putin-new-start-treaty.html"><strong>announced</strong></a> that
he would end his country’s participation.</p>
<p>In the year since Russia’s initial assault on Ukraine, the danger of
nuclear war has only inched ever closer. While President Biden’s White
House <a
href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/12/biden-says-he-doesnt-think-putin-will-use-nuclear-weapons-in-ukraine-war.html"><strong>raised
doubts</strong></a> that Putin would indeed use any of Russia’s tactical
nuclear weapons in Ukraine, the <em>Bulletin of Atomic
Scientists</em> ominously reset its Doomsday Clock at <a
href="https://thebulletin.org/doomsday-clock/current-time/"><strong>90
seconds to midnight</strong></a>, the closest since its creation in
1947. Those scientific experts weren’t buying what the Biden
administration was selling.</p>
<p>“As Russia’s war on Ukraine continues, the last remaining nuclear
weapons treaty between Russia and the United States… stands in
jeopardy,” <a
href="https://thebulletin.org/doomsday-clock/current-time/"><strong>read</strong></a> a
January 2023 press release from the <em>Bulletin</em> before Putin
backed out of the agreement. “Unless the two parties resume negotiations
and find a basis for further reductions, the treaty will expire in
February 2026. This would eliminate mutual inspections, deepen mistrust,
spur a nuclear arms race, and heighten the possibility of a nuclear
exchange.”</p>
<p><img class="a" src="thisimage"/></p>
<p>Of course, they were correct and, in mid-February, the Norwegian
government claimed Russia had already deployed ships armed with tactical
nukes in the Baltic Sea for the first time in more than 30 years.
“Tactical nuclear weapons are a particularly serious threat in several
operational scenarios in which NATO countries may be involved,” <a
href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/russia-norway-tactical-nuclear-weapons-b2282558.html"><strong>claimed</strong></a> the
report. “The ongoing tensions between Russia and the West mean that
Russia will continue to pose the greatest nuclear threat to NATO, and
therefore to Norway.”</p>
<p>For its part, in October 2022, NATO ran its own nuclear bombing
drills, designated “<a
href="https://www.reuters.com/world/russian-nuclear-strike-would-almost-certainly-draw-physical-response-nato-2022-10-12/"><strong>Steadfast
Noon</strong></a>,” with fighter jets in Europe’s skies involved in “war
games” (minus live weaponry). “It’s an exercise to ensure that our
nuclear deterrent remains safe, secure, and effective,” claimed NATO
chief Jens Stoltenberg, but it almost seemed as if NATO was taunting
Putin to cross the line.</p>
<p>And yet, here’s the true horror story lurking behind the war in
Ukraine. While a nuclear tit-for-tat between Russia and NATO — an
exchange that could easily destroy much of Eastern Europe in no time at
all — is a genuine, if frightening, prospect, it isn’t the most imminent
radioactive peril facing the region.</p>
<p><strong>Averting a Meltdown</strong></p>
<p>By now, we all ought to be familiar with the worrisome Zaporizhzhia
nuclear complex (ZNPP), which sits right in the middle of the Russian
incursion into Ukraine. Assembled between 1980 and 1986, Zaporizhzhia is
Europe’s largest nuclear-power complex, with six 950-megawatt reactors.
In February and March of last year, after a series of fierce battles,
which caused a fire to break out at a nearby training facility, the
Russians hijacked the embattled plant. Representatives of the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) were later sent in to ensure
that the reactors weren’t at immediate risk of meltdown and issued a <a
href="https://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/22/09/ukraine-2ndsummaryreport_sept2022.pdf"><strong>report
stating</strong></a>, in part, that:</p>
<p>“…further escalation affecting the six-reactor plant could lead to a
severe nuclear accident with potentially grave radiological consequences
for human health and the environment in Ukraine and elsewhere and that
renewed shelling at or near the ZNPP was deeply troubling for nuclear
safety and security at the facility.”</p>
<p>Since then, the fighting has only intensified. Russia kidnapped some
of the plant’s Ukrainian employees, including its deputy director Valery
Martynyuk. In September 2022, due to ongoing shelling in the area,
Zaporizhzhia was taken offline and, after losing external power on
several occasions, has since been sporadically relying on old diesel <a
href="https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/Zaporizhzhia-relying-on-diesel-generators-after-lo"><strong>backup
generators</strong></a>. (Once disconnected from the electrical grid,
backup power is crucial to ensure the plant’s reactors don’t overheat,
which could lead to a full-blown radioactive meltdown.)</p>
<p>However, relying on risk-prone backup power is a fool’s game,
according to electrical engineer Josh Karpoff. A member of <a
href="https://scienceforthepeople.org/"><strong>Science for the
People</strong></a> who previously worked for the New York State Office
of General Services where he designed electrical systems for buildings,
including large standby generators, Karpoff knows how these things work
in a real-world setting. He assures me that, although Zaporizhzhia is no
longer getting much attention in the general rush of Ukraine news, the
possibility of a major disaster there is ever more real. A backup
generator, he explains, is about as reliable as a ’75 Winnebago.</p>
<p>“It’s really not that hard to knock out these kinds of diesel
generators,” Karpoff adds. “If your standby generator starts up but says
there’s a leak in a high-pressure oil line fitting, it sprays heated,
aerosolized oil all over the hot motor, starting a fire. This happens to
diesel motors all the time. A similar diesel engine fire in a locomotive
was partly responsible for causing the <a
href="https://www.tsb.gc.ca/eng/rapports-reports/rail/2013/r13d0054/r13d0054.html"><strong>Lac
Megantic Rail Disaster</strong></a> in Quebec back in 2013.”</p>
<p>Sadly enough, Karpoff is on target. Just remember how the backup
generators failed at the three nuclear reactors in Fukushima, Japan, in
2011. Many people believe that the 9.0 magnitude underwater earthquake
caused them to melt down, but that’s not exactly the case.</p>
<p>It was, in fact, a horrific chain of worsening events. While the
earthquake itself didn’t damage Fukushima’s reactors, it cut the
facility off from the power grid, automatically switching the plant to
backup generators. So even though the fission reaction had stopped, heat
was still being produced by the radioactive material inside the reactor
cores. A continual water supply, relying on backup power, was needed to
keep those cores from melting down. Then, 30 minutes after that huge
quake, a tsunami struck, knocking out the plant’s seawater pumps, which
subsequently caused the generators to go down.</p>
<p>“The myth of the tsunami is that the tsunami destroyed the
[generators] and had that not happened, everything would have been
fine,” former nuclear engineer Arnie Gunderson <a
href="https://www.democracynow.org/2012/3/12/nuclear_engineer_arnie_gundersen_fukushima_meltdown"><strong>told</strong></a> Amy
Goodman on <em>Democracy Now!</em> “What really happened is that the
tsunami destroyed the [sea] pumps right along the ocean… Without that
water, the [diesel generators] will overheat, and without that water,
it’s impossible to cool a nuclear core.”</p>
<p>With the sea pumps out of commission, 12 of the plant’s 13
generators <a
href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0272937"><strong>ended
up </strong></a><a
href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0272937"><strong>failing</strong></a>.
Unable to cool, the reactors began to melt, leading to three hydrogen
explosions that released radioactive material, carried disastrously
across the region and out to sea by prevailing winds, where much of it
will continue to <a
href="https://www.whoi.edu/oceanus/feature/fukushima-disaster-response/"><strong>float
around</strong></a> and <a
href="https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/health-environment/article/3166415/radioactive-rockfish-caught-near-fukushima-nuclear"><strong>accumulate</strong></a> for
decades.</p>
<p>At Zaporizhzhia, there are several scenarios that could lead to a
similar failure of the standby generators. They could be directly
shelled and catch fire or clog up or just run out of fuel. It’s a dicey
situation, as the ongoing war edges Ukraine and the surrounding
countries toward the brink of a catastrophic nuclear crisis.</p>
<p>“I don’t know for how long we are going to be lucky in avoiding a
nuclear accident,” <a
href="https://euobserver.com/ukraine/156639"><strong>said</strong></a> Rafael
Grossi, director general of the IAEA in late January, calling it a
“bizarre situation: a Ukrainian facility in Russian-controlled
territory, managed by Russians, but operated by Ukrainians.”</p>
<p><strong>Bad Things Will Follow</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately, it’s not just Zaporizhzhia we have to worry about.
Though not much attention has been given to them, there are, in fact,<a

other nuclear power plants</strong></a> in the war zone and Russia has
also seized the ruined Chernobyl plant, where there is still significant
hot radioactive waste that must be <a
href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-business-health-europe-accidents-edcd5bc0e6bde3cbf6d7300bebc9343f"><strong>kept
cool</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Kate Brown, author of <em>Plutopia</em>, <a
href="https://magazine.scienceforthepeople.org/online/interview-kate-brown-ukraine/"><strong>told</strong></a> Science
for the People last April:</p>
<p>“Russians are apparently using these two captured nuclear
installations like kings on a chessboard. They hold Chernobyl and the
Zaporizhzhia nuclear power reactor plants, and they are stockpiling
weapons and soldiers there as safe havens. This is a new military tactic
we haven’t seen before, where you use the vulnerability of these
installations, as a defensive tactic. The Russians apparently figured
that the Ukrainians wouldn’t shoot. The Russians noticed that when they
came to the Chernobyl zone, the Ukrainian guard of the Chernobyl plant
stood down because they didn’t want missiles fired at these vulnerable
installations. There are twenty thousand spent nuclear fuel rods, more
than half of them in basins at that plant. It’s a precarious situation.
This is a new scenario for us.”</p>
<p>Of course, the hazards facing Zaporizhzhia and Chernobyl would be
mitigated if Putin removed his forces tomorrow, but there’s little
possibility of that happening. It’s worth noting as well that Ukraine is
not the only place where, in the future, such a scenario could play out.
Taiwan, at the center of a potential military conflict between the U.S.
and China, has several nuclear power plants. Iran operates a nuclear
facility. Pakistan has six reactors at two different sites. Saudi Arabia
is building a new facility. The list only goes on and on.</p>
<p>Even more regrettably, Russia has raised the nuclear stakes in a new
way, setting a distressing precedent with its illegal occupation of
Zaporizhzhia and Chernobyl, turning them into tools of war. No other
power-generating source operating in a war zone, even the worst of the
fossil-fuel users, poses such a potentially serious and immediate threat
to life as we know it on this planet.</p>
<p>And while hitting those Ukrainian reactors themselves is one recipe
for utter disaster, there are other potentially horrific “peaceful”
nuclear possibilities as well. What about a deliberate attack on
nuclear-waste facilities or those unstable backup generators? You
wouldn’t even have to strike the reactors directly to cause a disaster.
Simply take out the power-grid supply lines, hit the generators, and
terrible things will follow. With nuclear power, even the purportedly
“peaceful” type, the potential for catastrophe is obvious.</p>
<p><strong>The Greatest of Evils</strong></p>
<p>In my new book <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1642598283/ref=nosim/?tag=tomdispatch-20"><strong><em>Atomic
Days: The Untold Story of the Most Toxic Place in
America</em></strong></a>, I probe the horrors of the Hanford site in
Washington state, one of the locations chosen to develop the first
nuclear weapons for the covert Manhattan Project during World War II.
For more than 40 years, that facility churned out most of the plutonium
used in the vast American arsenal of atomic weapons.</p>
<p>Now, however, Hanford is a radioactive wasteland, as well as the
largest and most expensive environmental clean-up project in history. To
say that it’s a boondoggle would be an understatement. Hanford has 177
underground tanks loaded with 56 million gallons of steaming radioactive
gunk. Two of those tanks are currently leaking, their waste making its
way toward groundwater supplies that could eventually reach the Columbia
River. High-level whistleblowers I interviewed who worked at Hanford
told me they feared that a hydrogen build-up in one of those tanks, if
ignited, could lead to a Chernobyl-like event here in the United States,
resulting in a tragedy unlike anything this country has ever
experienced.</p>
<p>All of this makes me fear that those old Hanford tanks could someday
be possible targets for an attack. Sabotage or a missile strike on them
could cause a major release of radioactive material from coast to coast.
The economy would crash. Major cities would become unlivable. And
there’s precedent for this: in 1957, a massive <a
href="https://www.counterpunch.org/2022/11/04/russias-forgotten-nuclear-accident/"><strong>explosion</strong></a> occurred
at Mayak, Hanford’s Cold War sister facility in the then-Soviet Union
that manufactured plutonium for nukes. Largely unknown, it was the
second biggest peacetime radioactive disaster ever, only “bested” by the
Chernobyl accident. In Mayak’s case, a faulty cooling system gave out
and the waste in one of the facility’s tanks overheated, causing a
radioactive blast equivalent to the force of 70 tons of TNT, <a
href="https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-mayak-villagers-living-in-shadow-nuclear-tragedy/28921944.html"><strong>contaminating
20,000 square miles</strong></a>. Countless people died and <a
href="https://www.latimes.com/world/europe/la-fg-russia-mayak-20180216-story.html"><strong>whole
villages</strong></a> were forever vacated.</p>
<p>All of this is to say that nuclear waste, whether on a battlefield or
not, is an inherently nasty business. Nuclear facilities around the
world, containing less waste than the underground silos at Hanford, have
already shown us their <a
href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20022419/"><strong>vulnerabilities</strong></a>.
Last August, in fact, the Russians reported that containers housing
spent fuel waste at Zaporizhzhia were shelled by Ukrainian forces. “One
of the guided shells hit the ground ten meters from them (containers
with nuclear waste…). Others fell down slightly further — 50 and 200
meters,” <a
href="https://tass.com/politics/1494501"><strong>alleged</strong></a> Vladimir
Rogov, a Russian-appointed official there. “As the storage area is open,
a shell or a rocket may unseal containers and kilograms, or even
hundreds of kilograms of nuclear waste will be emitted into the
environment and contaminate it. To put it simply, it will be a ‘dirty
bomb.’”</p>
<p>Ukraine, in turn, <a
href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-62432873"><strong>blamed</strong></a> Russia
for the strike, but regardless of which side was at fault, after
Chernobyl (which some researchers believe affected upwards of <a
href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190725-will-we-ever-know-chernobyls-true-death-toll"><strong>1.8
million people</strong></a>) both the Ukrainians and the Russians
understand the grave risks of atomically-charged explosions. This is
undoubtedly why the Russians are apparently <a
href="https://www.ans.org/news/article-4595/russia-building-protection-over-zaporizhzhia-spent-fuel-tanks-according-to-russian-news-source/"><strong>constructing</strong></a> protective
coverings over Zaporizhzhia’s waste storage tanks. An incident at the
plant releasing radioactive particles would damage not just Ukraine but
Russia, too.</p>
<p>As former <em>New York Times</em> correspondent Chris Hedges so <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1644212935/ref=nosim/?tag=tomdispatch-20"><strong>aptly
put it</strong></a>, war is the greatest of evils and such evils rise
exponentially with the prospect of a nuclear apocalypse. Worse yet, a
radioactive Armageddon doesn’t have to come from the actual detonation
of nuclear bombs. It can take many forms. The atom, as Einstein warned
us, has certainly changed everything.</p>
