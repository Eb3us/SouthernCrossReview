<h3>The destruction of the first Goetheanum</h3>
<h3><em>A lecture by <strong>Rudolf Steiner</strong> for the workers who
built the first Goetheanum</em></h3>
<p>January 5, 1923, Dornach – GA 348</p>
<br/>
</header>

<main>
<p class="intro">This was the first lecture given to the workmen after the destruction
of the Goetheanum by arson on New Years Eve 1922/23. As a demonstration
of their sympathy, all present stood when Rudolf Steiner entered.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Steiner</em>: It is difficult to put into words the sorrow I
feel. I know of your deep sympathy, so let me be brief. May I take this
opportunity to call attention to the fact that as early as January 23,
1921, here in this hall, I read from a brochure a statement made by an
opponent, indeed, one can already say an enemy, that went like this:</p>
<p>There are plenty of spiritual sparks of fire that strike like
lightning against the wooden mouse trap. It will require quite a bit of
cleverness on Steiner's part to work in a conciliatory manner so as to
prevent a real spark of fire from bringing the Dornach grandeur to an
inglorious end some day.</p>
<p>You see, with such inflammatory talk it is not surprising when
something like the fire occurs, and in view of such vehement hostility
it was something that could easily be feared. You can understand why it
was easy to fear. It is true, however, that even now one can see what
certain groups think about the matter. We need only consider the
antagonism contained in the poor taste of newspapers, which now, after
the Goetheanum has been destroyed, ask, “Didn't that `clairvoyant'
Steiner foresee this fire?” That such attitudes are also evidence of a
great stupidity is something I don't wish to talk about now. It points
to a malicious degree of hostility, however, that some people find it at
all necessary to publish such statements! One learns from this what
people think and how crude things are today. It is indeed crude!</p>
<p>You can be sure, however, that I will never let anything divert me
from my path, come what may. As long as I live I shall represent my
cause and will continue in the same way as I have done up to now. Also,
I naturally hope that there will be no interruption here in any area, so
that in the future we can work together here at this location in the
same way as we have before; at least, that is my intention. Come what
may, my thought is that the building will have to be reconstructed in
some form; to be sure, no effort will be spared toward that end. We must
therefore go on in the same way as before; this is simply an inner
commitment.</p>
<p>Today, I wish to make use of our time by saying a few things to you
that relate to the subject we discussed a little before this sad event.
I tried to show you that a true science must work toward recognizing
again the soul-spiritual aspects of the human being. I don't believe you
have any idea of how emotionally charged is the reaction that this
matter calls forth today within scientific circles. These scientific
circles, as they call themselves today, which are taken to be something
special by the layman, are the very ones that stand ready to make common
cause with all existing hostile forces when it is a matter of proceeding
against the anthroposophical movement. You must see that the hatred
against the anthroposophical movement is by no means a slight matter.
During the days when the tragedy took place, a report reached me, for
example, of the formation of an association that calls itself “The
Association of Non-Anthroposophical Experts on Anthroposophy.” They are
people who naturally have nothing to do with the accident here. but are
part of the whole opposition. The report concludes with the words, “This
calls for a life-or-death struggle. The side that has the Holy Spirit
will gain victory.”</p>
<p>It is obvious from the idiotic things said by these people, who want
a life-or-death struggle, that the spirit — leaving the Holy Spirit
completely aside — is not with these people. That is evident at once
from the minutes of their meeting. Nevertheless, the spirit of hatred
that exists is expressed in the sentence, “This calls for a
life-or-death struggle.” People do wage this struggle, and the number of
opponents is indeed not small. So called scientific groups participate
in these affairs today and in a most intensive way at that.</p>
<p>You see, I must continue to stress this, because the authority of
science is so strong today. In order to know something, one turns to a
so-called scientific expert, because this is the way things are
arranged. Laymen don't know the means by which such persons become
“experts” and that one can be the greatest idiot and yet be an “expert”
with certifications, <em>etc.</em> These matters must be fully
comprehended, and it is therefore important to get to the bottom of
things and understand what really lies at their foundation. The very
first sentences taught little children in school today — not directly,
but indirectly — are mostly rubbish! Things that are considered
self-evident today are in fact rubbish.</p>
<p>One is attacked from all sides today if one says it is nonsense that
the brain thinks, for it is agreed everywhere that the brain thinks and
that where there is no brain, there can be no thinking, that there are
no thoughts where no brain exists. Well, from my lectures you will have
seen that the brain naturally plays its part in, and has a significance
for, thinking. But if those people, who in fact make little use of their
brains, claim that the brain is a sort of machine with which one thinks,
then this is mere thoughtlessness. It is not surprising when a simple,
uneducated person believes this, because he is not in possession of all
the facts and so he adheres to the voice of the authority. No logic and
real thinking, however, are contained in the statement that the brain
thinks, and today I shall give you a number of examples to prove it.</p>
<p>If you look at a small beetle, you can easily see that it has a small
head. If you dissect the head of such a beetle — the burying beetle, for
instance — you discover nothing like a brain, which is supposed to be
the thinking apparatus. Naturally, the tiny beetle has no brain in this
sense but only a little lump, a lump of nerves, you could say. It does
not have even the beginnings of a complete brain.</p>
<p>Now, I will relate a scene to you as an example, but before I give
you this example I must tell you that these burying beetles always
follow the lifelong habit of laying their eggs, and maggots hatch from
them that only later change into beetles. As soon as they have emerged
from the eggs, these tiny maggots require meat for their nourishment.
They could not live without it. So, what does the burying beetle do? It
searches in the field for a dead mouse or a dead bird or a mole, and
having discovered one — a dead mouse, for example — it runs home again,
only to return not alone but with a number of other beetles. These
beetles that it has returned with run all around the mouse. Picture the
mouse here (sketching); the beetle has discovered it; it runs off and
then returns with a number of other burying-beetles. You see them run
all around it. Occasionally, you notice that they all run away. At other
times, you will see the beetles arrive, run around the dead mouse, and
then start digging. First, they dig the ground under the mouse and then
all around it. The mouse gradually sinks deeper and deeper into the
earth as they continue digging. They dig until the mouse finally falls
into the ground. They then fetch the females, who lay their eggs in it.
Finally, they cover the hole completely so that passersby wouldn't
notice it. I mentioned earlier that sometimes you can observe the
beetles leave without returning. When you look into this, you find that
the ground is too hard to dig. The beetles seem to have realized that
here they could do nothing. Whenever they stay and begin digging, the
ground is soft.</p>
<p>It is unbelievably strange but true that only ten or twelve beetles
return with the one that makes the discovery, never forty or fifty. Only
as many beetles return as are required to do the work. The first beetle
doesn't bring more helpers than it needs, nor does it bring fewer. It
arrives with just the right number to do the job. This sounds
unbelievable, but what I am telling you is not a fairy tale. People have
been able to demonstrate this phenomenon with all kinds of experiments.
It's absolutely true.</p>
<p>The person who first described the activity of these beetles wasn't a
superstitious person but one who had sound judgment. He was a friend of
the botanist, Gleditsch, and was a scientist in the first half of the
nineteenth century, an age when science was still on a sounder basis. He
was involved in experimental work and once used toads in his
experiments. These tests were intended for something completely
different — you know that electricity was first discovered through work
on a frog's thigh — and he needed to dry a dead toad. What did this
natural scientist do? He took it outside and pinned the dead toad to a
small piece of wood to let the sun dry it quickly. After a while he
returned to check it and found a number of beetles around it hard at
work. He decided to leave the dead toad alone and watch what these
fellows, the beetles, were up to. What did they do? They continued
digging until the wood fell and the toad had a place in the ground, in
the hole; then the females were allowed to lay their eggs in it. That
done, the beetles covered the toad and the wood it was pinned to with
earth. Now, if a human being were to do that, one would think he also
buried the stick in order to hide every trace. So you see, the burying
beetles do exactly what a clever human being would do; indeed, I am
convinced that a number of stupid people wouldn't do anywhere near as
well. You see, therefore, that what is called cleverness, intelligence,
is present without the beetles possessing it.</p>
<p>One might call this nonsense and say that it need not be looked upon
as intelligence, that it is stupid to say it is intelligence since it is
simply instinct. Of course, I consider it stupid for a person to use the
word “instinct” in this case, thus getting on the wrong track. One needs
a word, however, and “instinct” is used for everything, so that one need
not think at all. I must learn to know the issue itself — it is all the
same what I call it — I must learn to know the issue. Still, one might
object by saying, “All right, but what he has told us is still nonsense.
The beetles are born with this ability; they pass it on genetically; one
need not think of intelligence here. It is inherent in their physical
nature, and there is no need to think that these beetles possess
intelligence.”</p>
<p>Now I shall tell you another story that was told by a person of
incontestable authority, a story that has also been reported by others
but above all by Darwin, an incontestable source; after all, people
swear by Darwin, don't they? He observed this activity in wasps, not
beetles. Wasps have brains that are no larger than those of beetles.
Their larvae also require meat as soon as they hatch. Now, these wasps
are weaker than beetles, even when they band together, so they cannot
handle moles or dead toads but prefer smaller creatures that they can
handle without help. This is why such wasps gather little animals like
flies and such for their young.</p>
<p>Darwin, who is considered to be the greatest natural scientist of the
nineteenth century, observed a wasp who needed such an animal, a female
wasp, heavy with eggs, looking for an insect into which to lay them.
Finding a fly, a dead fly, on the ground, she tried to fly away with it,
but it was too difficult for her. What did the wasp do? It bit off the
fly's head and hind quarters and flew off with the breast and wings,
which it could manage. Without the head and hind quarters of the fly,
the wasp could now fly. Now — as I said, Darwin watched all this — a
strong breeze was blowing and the wasp could not fly forward because the
fly's wings caught the wind. The two wings caught the wind, and it could
not fly forward. Again, what did the wasp do, laden with the fly? It
landed on the ground, bit off the two wings, and flew away with the
fly's breast without the wings.</p>
<p>In this case it is impossible to say that this is anything else but
deliberate, since the wasp, after all, accommodated itself to the wind.
This cannot be inherent in the wasp, to bite off the wings. It must be
what is called intelligence that motivates the insect. The wasp tells
itself that if the wings are discarded the wind won't catch in them. It
is impossible for this to be inherited; what exists there is what one
calls deliberation; consequently, one must admit that intelligence is
really at work here. Here intelligence is at work.</p>
<p>Now you can see how scientists proceeded in the nineteenth century. I
purposely mentioned to you Darwin, who observed this. What was his
conclusion however? Darwin said that everything that confronts us in
animals is produced only through heredity and through natural selection,
and so forth.</p>
<p>In order to set up theories, people simply suppress what they
themselves know. This is the essential point, that people suppress what
they know to set up convenient theories. Such theories are by no means
scientific and only throw sand in the eyes of the public. Darwin was
certainly a great man, and nobody has acknowledged his positive
accomplishments in a more kindly way than I. I have written everything
possible in Darwin's favor, but, oddly enough, we must realize that even
those who have made significant contributions have suffered from the
malady of having no eyes for facts. In spite of the great scientific
triumphs made in the external world, it is characteristic of scientists
of the nineteenth century that people completely lost their sense for
facts, and the facts were simply suppressed.</p>
<p>Now, let's go further. Let's consider other insects. In these matters
one must study insects, because they can illuminate our subject
particularly well; we can be quite sure that in their case they do not
owe their intelligence to having a large brain, because this they
certainly don't have. Therefore, one must study insects in this matter.
Indeed, not only are they able to illuminate the things I have just
described but many others as well. Insects lay their eggs, and a mature
insect never emerges from them but only little worms. With butterflies,
which are insects, it is even more complicated. First, a little worm
appears, a caterpillar; it pupates, and finally from the chrysalis
emerges the butterfly. This is certainly quite a transformation, but
this transformation actually occurs with all insects. You see, there are
some insects that, when they are fully mature, feed only on plants. I am
not agitating for vegetarianism, as you know, gentlemen, but these
insects are vegetarians. They eat only plants. The strange thing is that
their larvae, the maggots, require meat when they hatch. These insects
therefore have a great peculiarity, that they are born with a completely
different food preference from that which they later acquire. They
convert to plant food only when they are fully developed insects. When
they are still little children and look completely different — like
maggots or worms — they feed on meat.</p>
<p>What do these mature insects do? They seek out other insects, mostly
caterpillars, and lay their eggs on their backs. They themselves no
longer have an appetite for meat, but they know that maggots requiring
meat will hatch from their eggs. Therefore, they lay their eggs in the
body of such a caterpillar or some such animal. Though one can marvel at
this cleverness, there is much more. One can even say that these newly
hatched maggots are already clever. Consider that some maggot species
depend on <em>living</em> flesh for food. When it is time to lay the
eggs, this insect, which has a stinger, punctures another living insect
that is larger and lays many eggs within it. Sometimes numerous eggs are
thus deposited, filling the caterpillar's body, and from which the
maggots hatch. The maggots are then within the body of this other
insect. These eggs are only deposited in live insects, because if the
animal in which the eggs are laid were to die, the eggs would be lost,
since the maggots can only survive on living flesh. Consider, therefore,
that if a maggot were to destroy a vital organ in the host insect, thus
causing its death, all the other maggots hatching from the eggs would
perish. These little creatures are so clever, however, that nothing is
ever eaten in the living caterpillar except those parts not needed for
its survival. All vital organs are spared, and the caterpillar stays
alive. Regardless of how many eggs are deposited, only so much is
consumed as to ensure the host insect's life.</p>
<p>You see, these things are known but are simply suppressed. People
know it but suppress it, and it isn't well received, naturally, when one
points them out, because this not only shows up the incapability but the
downright dishonesty of official science.</p>
<p>In the case of animals and insects you can see that it is possible to
say that they certainly do not possess intelligence, because they have
no apparatus for intelligence, that is, brains. Nevertheless,
intelligence is working in what they do, and it must be admitted that
intelligence is there. The animals do not deliberate; deliberation would
require a brain; animals don't deliberate, but what takes place in their
activities is intelligent. Indeed, it happens that animals even have
something similar to memory. They have no recollection but something
akin to it. You can observe this, for instance, if you are a bee keeper.
Here stands a beehive. The bees hatch. For the sake of an experiment,
you move the hive to a nearby spot. The bees return to the first
location; naturally, this is “instinct,” and there is no need to be
surprised about it; they fly in the direction from which they flew away.
Now, however, they begin to look everywhere for the hive and fly around
seeking it. They arrive at the new location but do not enter the hive
immediately. Instead, they swarm around it for a long time, and one can
definitely conclude that they are examining it to see if it is their
own! The burying beetle does the same when it examines the ground to see
if it is hard or soft. While bees have no recollection, the above
incident shows that they nevertheless possess something similar to
memory; namely, they must determine whether it is the same beehive. We
do this with our memory; bees do it with something similar.</p>
<p>You see, what works as intelligence through the human head is at work
everywhere. Intelligence is at work everywhere; even in insects there is
marvelous intelligence. Picture the wonderful intelligence at work when
the larvae that hatch inside the caterpillar's body do not feed
immediately on its stomach. If they did, all the maggots would perish.
Compared with the tactics employed by humans during war, the
intelligence ruling the insect arouses respect and exposes the
foolishness of human beings. In this regard, human beings have no reason
to claim sole possession of intelligence.</p>
<p>I'll tell you something else now. You are all familiar with paper.
You all know that the paper we have today was invented no earlier than
four or five hundred years ago. Before this, parchment and all sorts of
materials were used for writing. Civilized man discovered so-called rag
paper just four or five centuries ago. Before this, man wrote on leather
and so on. How was paper discovered? One had to discover how to mix
together certain substances in a specific way. Perhaps one of you has
been in a paper factory. At first, the paper is liquid; it is then
solidified, <em>etc.</em> It is produced in a purely artificial way
through various chemical and mechanical means. Perhaps you've not only
seen paper but also now and then a wasps' nest. A wasps' nest is built
like this (sketching). It is attached to something and formed so the
wasps can fly into it. It is grey, not white — but paper can be grey,
too — and this wasps' nest is real paper. If one asks, what is a wasps'
nest made of chemically, chemically it is identical with paper. It is
real paper.</p>
<p>Wasps, however, have been building their nests for thousands and
thousands of years, not just four or five hundred. You can see,
therefore, that wasps manufactured paper much earlier than humans.
That's simply a fact: the wasps' nest is made of paper. If, thousands of
years ago, people had been clever enough to examine the substance of a
wasps' nest, they would have discovered paper then. Chemistry was not
that advanced, however; neither was writing, through which some things
have also come about that do not exactly serve humanity. In any case,
the wasp has made paper for an immeasurably longer time than the human
being has.</p>
<p>Naturally, I could go on, not for hours but for days, to speak of how
intelligence pervades everything and is found everywhere. Man simply
gathers this intelligence that is spread out in the world and puts it to
use. Owing to his well-developed brain, he can put to his own use what
permeates the world. Thanks to his brain, he can utilize the
intelligence contained in all things for his own benefit.</p>
<p>Our brain is not given us for the purpose of producing intelligence.
It is sheer nonsense to believe that we produce intelligence. It is as
stupid as saying, “I went to the pond with a water pitcher to fetch
water. Look, it contains water now; a minute ago there was none; the
water, therefore, materialized from the walls of the pitcher!” Everybody
will say that is nonsense. The water came from the pond; it was not
produced by the pitcher. The experts, however, point to the brain, which
simply collects intelligence because it is present in everything, like
the water, and claim that intelligence emerges from within it. It is as
foolish as saying that water is produced by the pitcher. After all,
intelligence is even present where there is no brain, just as the pond
does not depend on the water pitcher. Intelligence exists everywhere,
and man can take hold of it. Just as the water from the pitcher can be
put to use, so man can make use of his brain when he gathers the
intelligence that is present everywhere in the world. To this day,
however, he is not making use of it in a particularly outstanding
manner.</p>
<p>You can see that it is a matter of correct thinking. But those who
never think correctly — for they show that they cannot think correctly —
claim that intelligence is produced by the brain. This is as foolish as
claiming that water from a pond is produced by its container. Such
foolishness, however, is science today. Actually, these matters should
be obvious; one should simply realize that intelligence is something
that must be gathered together.</p>
<p>Now, you can take your brain and resolve to gather intelligence
somewhere. It doesn't collect intelligence any more than the empty water
pitcher, which, when you put it away, remains empty. By itself the water
pitcher cannot fetch water, nor does the brain collect intelligence by
itself. You cannot leave the brain to its own devices and expect it to
function any more than the water pitcher. What must be present so that
the brain can gather intelligence? The empty water pitcher alone can be
compared to the belief that man consists only of blood, nerves, and
brain. Something else must be present that does the collecting and that
gathers intelligence by means of the brain. It is the
psychical-spiritual element of man that does the collecting. It enters
man as I described recently in the lecture on embryonic development. It
has previously existed in the soul-spiritual world and only makes use of
the physical. If the facts are not suppressed, if one sees that
intelligence, like water, pervades everything and, like water in a
pitcher, must be gathered together, then — if one is a serious scientist
and not a charlatan — one must search for the gatherer. This is simply
what follows from the use of clear reason. It is not true that the
anthroposophical science of the spirit is less scientific than ordinary
science; it is much more scientific, much more scientific.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, one could see the kind of logic people
employ. As you know, a natural scientific course was recently held here.
I have already told you of experiments conducted in Stuttgart concerning
the task of the spleen. We confirmed that the spleen has the task of
serving as a sort of regulator of the digestive rhythm. The blood
circulation has a definite rhythm, as found in the pulse with its
seventy — two beats per minute. These are related to the intake of food.
People also pay little heed to a rhythmic intake of food; they are not
too good at it, however, and frequently have no set mealtime. Worse yet,
people indiscriminately partake of foods that are useful for them and
those that are not. There is no regularity here as there is in the
blood. If, for example, I eat at one o'clock instead of two o'clock,
this is an irregularity. The blood circulation, after all, doesn't work
that way and doesn't produce a different pulse when it requires
nourishment. This is where the spleen takes over. We have tried to
demonstrate this with experiments and have been successful to a degree.
More experiments are needed and must be done soon, but we have been able
to show to some extent that the spleen is a regulator. Though we might
have irregular eating habits, the spleen keeps food in the intestines as
long as the blood needs it. If we don't starve ourselves too much — if
we starve ourselves too much even the spleen would be unable to function
properly — the spleen supplies the blood with fat taken from our own
body.</p>
<p>You see, because we were completely honest, Dr. Kolisko quite
honestly stated in her book that in my medical course I indicated that
the spleen has this task, and she then proceeded with experiments to
confirm this. Then a professor in Munich said that this was easy; she
had already received the indications from anthroposophy and so had them
in her pocket. It is not supposed to be hypothetical-deductive science
if one starts with indications and then conducts experiments. He
therefore said that this isn't hypothetical-deductive science.</p>
<p>Why does the professor say that? Because people do not wish to work
with a thought as their guideline. Instead, they want a lot of material
delivered to their laboratories, and they blindly begin to experiment
until they happen on some result. They call this hypothetical-deductive
science, but there is no hypothesis in it at all. Occasionally, the most
significant discoveries are made by chance. Then, well — even a blind
dog sometimes finds a morsel! How could we progress, however, if in our
laboratories our work did not follow our ideas?</p>
<p>The professor in Munich says that it is not hypothetical-deductive
science for one to work with indications. Now, imagine that somewhere
experiments had been conducted that proved the spleen's function but
that a fire had destroyed the reports of the work. Only the final result
would be known. Couldn't somebody come along and say that he would
repeat these experiments? It would not be any different from our
starting out with these indications. The same professor would also have
to object to that as being unscientific. Now, wouldn't that be absurd?
The only difference here is that I have made my indications by tracing
the spiritual course of the matter, but I have done it in such a way
that it can readily be followed according to anatomical science. Then,
through experiments, another person seeks affirmation of what had been
precisely indicated. Our task here was simply to show correct physical
proof for what I had said. There is no logical difference between my
knowledge acquired by spiritual scientific means and what another person
has already found earlier by means of experiments.</p>
<p>What does it indicate when someone considers it to be
hypothetical-deductive science when something has been discovered by
physical means, though the descriptions of the tests may have been
burned, while anything done by anthroposophy is not considered
hypothetical-deductive science? It indicates that one is not honest and
that from the first one denounces anything coming from anthroposophy.
People aren't really concerned about hypothetical-deductive science;
they are so foolish that they don't notice that this is logical
nonsense. They say that ours is not hypothetical-deductive science not
because it would be logical to say so but only because it derives from
anthroposophy. People are too foolish to comprehend what comes from
anthroposophy. Naturally, their lack of comprehension makes them angry,
and therefore they denounce it. The real reason anthroposophy is
considered heresy is that those who are engaged in so-called science do
not think and cannot understand anthroposophy. This is an aspect of our
entire civilization. It is possible today to be a great scientist or
scholar without being able really to think. In the future, one must
truly cultivate honesty, an honesty that takes into account all the
facts, not only those that conveniently fit one's pet theory, thus
throwing sand in the eyes of the public.</p>
<p>The hatred of anthroposophy is based in large part on anthroposophy's
honesty, something people don't want to grant it. If people had a keener
sense for truth, they would often stop writing after the first sentence.
Since all their arguments against anthroposophy would collapse, however,
if anthroposophy were properly studied, they invent all kinds of
fabrications concerning it. People inventing fabrications about
anthroposophy don't care about truth, and once they start telling lies,
they go further. The serious defamation of anthroposophy thus arises.
What is the result? A person who cannot see through all this believes
that anthroposophists engage in devilry. Such a person cannot see
through this, because he naturally believes the authorities, who do not
speak the truth. Anthroposophy suffers most of all from these lies that
are circulated about it, whereas its one aim is to focus on the facts
and be a real science.</p>
<p>In view of the painful tragedy that has struck here, we must at least
look into the real state of affairs and realize how anthroposophy is
being slandered with a spirit of pure falsehood.</p>
<p>I myself am absolutely opposed to any agitation coming from our side.
Naturally, I cannot stop everything, but when I speak to you I am
strictly pointing out facts. This is all I have done today, and from
these facts I have drawn a general characterization of scientific life.
You must admit to yourselves that where such facts are ignored there is
no desire to create real science but only a desire to throw sand in the
eyes of the public, even if in a quite unconscious way. People would
have to be much more clever to see through this.</p>
<p>We shall continue on Monday. If you have something to ask, I would
like you to speak entirely from your hearts. I, for one, don't wish to
be deterred by the great tragedy that has struck here. This is why I
didn't want to waste my time lamenting but wanted to tell you something
useful.</p>
