<main>
<p class="intro">These are the secret sayings which the living Yeshúa spoke and
Didymos Judas Thomas recorded. (Jer 23:18, Mt 13:34, Lk 1:1, 8:10,
10:21, Jn 21:25, Rev/Ap 1:17;)</p>
<p><strong>1.  And he</strong> {<strong>says</strong>¹}<strong>: Whoever
finds the interpretation of these sayings shall not taste
death.</strong> (Isa 25:8, Lk 9:27, Jn 5:24, 8:51; this is apparently an
introductory logion quoting Thomas himself, included [like Jn 21:24] by
his own disciples, since it speaks of the following as a
<em>collection</em> of sayings; ¹throughout the Greek fragments of
Thomas, ‘<u>x</u> says’ is in the present tense— see Henry Barclay Swete
[1897], Recent Scholarly Comments)</p>
<p><strong>2.  Yeshúa says: Let him who seeks not cease seeking until he
finds, and when he finds he shall be troubled, and when he has been
troubled he shall marvel and he shall reign over everyone</strong>¹
{<strong>and find repose</strong>}(¹or over the totality ; Gen 1:26, Dan
7:27, Lk 1:29, 22:25-30!, Rev/Ap 1:6, 3:21, 20:4, 22:5; =Clement of
Alexandria, <a
href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0210.htm"><em>Stromata</em></a>
II.9 &amp; V.14;)</p>
<p><strong>3.  Yeshúa says: If those who would lead you, say to you:
Behold, the Sovereignty is in the sky</strong> <strong>!, then the birds
of the sky would precede you. If they say to you: It is in the sea!,
then the fish</strong> {<strong>of the sea</strong>} <strong>would
precede you. But the Sovereignty</strong> {<strong>of God</strong>}
<strong>exists within you and it exists without you.</strong>
{<strong>Those who come to recognize</strong> <strong>themselves shall
find it, and when you come to recognize yourselves</strong>}
<strong>then you shall know that you are the Sons of the Living Father.
Yet if you do not recognize yourselves then you are impoverished and you
are poverty.</strong> (Gen 6:2, Dt 30:11-14, Hos 1:10, Mal 2:10, Lk
11:41, 17:21, Plato's <a
href="http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/philebus.html"><em>Philebus</em></a>
48c, 63c;)</p>
<p><strong>4.  Yeshúa says: The person old in days will not hesitate to
ask a little child of seven days concerning the place of life— and he
shall live. For many who are first shall become last,</strong>
{<strong>and the last first</strong>}<strong>. And they shall become a
single unity.</strong> (Gen 2:2-3, 17:12, Mt 11:25-26, 18:1-6 &amp;
10-14, Lk 2:21;)</p>
<p><strong>5.  Yeshúa says: Recognize Him in front of thy face, and what
is hidden from thee shall be revealed to thee. For there is nothing
concealed which shall not be manifest,</strong> {<strong>and nothing
buried that shall not be raised</strong>¹}.(=Mt 10:26; in his scriptural
<em>Traditions</em> the Apostle Matthias [Ac 1:21-26] relates Christ's
logion: ‘Wonder at what is in front of you’<strong>—</strong> quoted by
Clement of Alexandria, <em><a
href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0210.htm">Stromata</a></em> II.9;
¹anti-Gnostic ;)</p>
<p><strong>6.  His Disciples ask him,</strong>¹ <strong>they say to him:
How do thou want us to fast, and how shall we pray? And how shall we
give alms, and what diet shall we maintain? || Yeshúa says: Do not
lie</strong>²<strong>, and do not practice what you
hate</strong>³<strong>— for everything</strong> <strong>is revealed
before the face of the sky. For there is nothing concealed that shall
not be manifest, and there is nothing covered that shall remain without
being exposed.</strong>³ª (Lev 19:11, Th 14; 
asyndeton,
or omission of conjunctions, characterizing Semitic languages but not
Greek or Coptic, thus signaling an underlying Semitic source-text—
Matthew Black, <em>An Aramaic Approach to the Gospels and Acts</em>:
‘Asyndeton is, on the whole, contrary to the spirit of the Greek
language ... but is highly characteristic of Aramaic’; ²thus Socrates in
the <a
href="http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/phaedo.html"><em>Phaedo</em></a>:
‘False words ... inflict the soul with evil’; ³cp. Confucius, <a
href="http://classics.mit.edu/Confucius/analects.html"><em>Analects</em></a>
8.15: ‘Is there any one word ... which could be adopted as a lifelong
rule of conduct?... Is not Sympathy the word? Do not to others what you
would not like yourself’; ³ªthus the <a
href="http://etext.virginia.edu/koran.html">Qur’án</a> 27.75: ‘There is
nothing concealed in the heaven and the earth, but it is in a clear
book’;)</p>
<p><strong>7.  Yeshúa says: Blest be the lion which the human eats— and
the lion shall become human. And accursed be the human which the lion
eats— and the</strong> [<strong>human</strong>] <strong>shall
become</strong> [<strong>lion</strong>].</p>
<p><strong>8.  And he says: The</strong> [<strong>Sovereignty</strong>]
<strong>is like a wise fisherman who cast his net into the sea. He drew
it up from the sea full of small fish. Among them he found a large good
fish. That wise fisherman, he threw all the small fish back into the
sea,</strong>¹ <strong>he chose the large fish without hesitation.
Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear!</strong> (¹asyndeton; =Mt
13:47-48;)</p>
<p><strong>9.  Yeshúa says: Behold, the sower came forth— he filled his
hand, he threw. Some indeed fell upon the road— the birds came, they
gathered them. Others fell on the bedrock— and they did not take root
down into the soil, and did not sprout grain skyward. And others fell
among the thorns— they choked the seed, and the worm ate them. And
others fell upon the good earth— and it produced good fruit up toward
the sky, it bore 60-fold and 120-fold.</strong> (multiple asyndeta; Mt
13:18-23, =Mk 4:3-9;)</p>
<p><strong>10.  Yeshúa says: I have cast fire upon the world</strong>
<strong>— and behold, I guard it until it is ablaze.</strong> (Lk
12:49;)</p>
<p><strong>11.  Yeshúa says: This sky shall pass away, and the one above
it shall pass away.</strong> (I-Ki 8:27!, Isa 65:17, Rev/Ap 21:1)
<strong>And the dead are not alive, and the living shall not die. In the
days when you consumed the dead, you transformed it to life— when you
come into the Light, what will you do? On the day when you were united,
you became separated— yet when you have become separated, what will you
do?</strong> (Mt 24:35, Ph 86!;)</p>
<p><strong>12.  The Disciples say to Yeshúa: We know that thou shall go
away from us. Who is it that shall be Rabbi</strong> <strong>over us? ||
Yeshúa says to them: In the place that you have come, you shall go to
Jacob the Righteous</strong> <strong>, for whose sake the sky and earth
come to be.</strong> (apparently a post-resurrection dialog; Mk 6:3, Jn
7:5, Ac 1:14, 12:17, Jas 1:1;)</p>
<p><strong>13.  Yeshúa says to his Disciples: Make a comparison to me,
and tell me whom I resemble.</strong> (Isa 46:5) <strong>|| Shimon
Kefa</strong> <strong>says to him: Thou art like a righteous angel. ||
Matthew</strong> <strong>says to him: Thou art like a
philosopher</strong> <strong>of the heart. || Thomas says to him:
Teacher, my mouth will not at all be capable of saying whom thou art
like! || Yeshúa says: I'm not thy teacher, now that thou have drunk,
thou have become drunken from the bubbling spring which I have measured
out. And he takes him, he withdraws, he speaks three words to
him:</strong></p>
<div style="text-align:center">
<p><strong>hyh) r#) hyh)</strong><br />
<strong><em>ahyh    ashr    ahyh</em></strong><br />
<strong>I-Am  Who  I-Am</strong></p>
</div>
<p><strong>Now when Thomas comes to his comrades, they inquire of him:
What did Yeshúa say to thee? || Thomas says to them: If I tell you even
one of the words which he spoke to me, you will take up stones to cast
at me— and fire will come from the stones to consume you.</strong> (the
Name does not appear in the papyrus, but can be inferred; Ex 3:14, Lev
24:16, Mk 14:62, Lk 6:40, Jn 4:14, 15:1, Th 61b, 77, cp. <a
href="http://www.goodnewsinc.net/othbooks/odesolmn.html">Odes of St.
Solomon</a> 11:6-9— ‘I drank and was inebriated with the living water
that does not die’; note also the infinite gematria of Ex
3:14159263...;)</p>
<p><strong>14.  Yeshúa says to them: If you fast</strong>¹<strong>, you
shall beget transgression</strong> <strong>for yourselves.</strong>²
<strong>And if you pray</strong>¹<strong>, you shall be condemned. And
if you give alms</strong>¹<strong>, you shall cause evil to your
spirits. And when you go into any land to travel in the regions, if they
receive you then eat what they set before you and heal the sick among
them. For what goes into your mouth will not defile you— but rather what
comes out of your mouth, that is what will defile you.</strong> (¹in
public; ²cp. Confucius, <a
href="http://classics.mit.edu/Confucius/analects.html"><em>Analects</em></a>
15.31: ‘I once spent all day thinking without taking food and all night
thinking without going to bed, but I found that I gained nothing from
it; it would have been better for me to have spent the time in
learning’; Isa 58:6-9, Mk 7:14-23!, Mt 6:1-6 &amp; 16-18, Lk 18:1!, =Lk
10:8-9, Th 6, 95, 104, Ph 74;)</p>
<p><strong>15.  Yeshúa says: When you see him who was not born of woman,
prostrate yourselves upon your faces and worship him— he is your
Father.</strong> (Josh 5:14, Lk 17:16, Th 46!, 101!;)</p>
<p><strong>16.  Yeshúa says: People perhaps think that I have come to
cast peace upon the world, and they do not know that I have come to cast
conflicts upon the earth— fire, sword, war</strong> <strong>.</strong>
(Isa 66:15-16, Joel 2:30-31, Zeph 3:8, Mal 4:1, Th 10) <strong>For there
shall be five in a house— three shall be against two and two against
three, the father against the son and the son against the father. And
they shall stand as solitaries.</strong> (=Mic 7:6, =Lk 12:49-53;)</p>
<p><strong>17.  Yeshúa says: I shall give to you what eye has not seen
and what ear has not heard and what hand has not touched and what has
not arisen in the mind of mankind.</strong> (Isa 64:4;)</p>
<p><strong>18.  The Disciples say to Yeshúa: Tell us how our end shall
be.</strong> (Ps 39:4) <strong>|| Yeshúa says: Have you then discovered
the origin</strong> <strong>, so that you inquire about the end? For at
the place where the origin is, there shall be the end. Blest be he who
shall stand at the origin— and he shall know the end, and he shall not
taste death.</strong> (Lk 20:38, Th 1;)</p>
<p><strong>19.  Yeshúa says: Blest be he who was before he came into
being. If you become Disciples to me and heed my sayings, these stones
shall serve you. For you have five trees</strong> <strong>in paradise,
which in summer are unmoved and in winter their leaves do not fall—
whoever is acquainted with them shall not taste death.</strong> (the
five senses?!; Ps 1:3, Th 1, 18, Tr 28;)</p>
<p><strong>20.  The Disciples say to Yeshúa: Tell us what the
Sovereignty of the Heavens</strong> <strong>is like. || He says to them:
It resembles a mustard seed, smaller than all</strong>
(<strong>other</strong>) <strong>seeds— yet when it falls on the tilled
earth, it produces a great plant and becomes shelter for the birds of
the sky.</strong> (=Mk 4:30-32;)</p>
<p><strong>21.  Mariam</strong> <strong>says to Yeshúa: Whom are thy
Disciples like? || He says: They are like little children who are
sojourning in a field which is not theirs. When the owners of the field
come, they will say: Leave our field to us! They take off their clothing
in front of them in order to yield it to them and to give back their
field to them. Therefore I say, if the householder ascertains that the
thief is coming, he will be alert before he arrives and will not allow
him to dig thru into the house of his domain to carry away his
belongings. Yet you, beware of the system</strong> <strong>— gird up
your loins with great strength lest the bandits find a way to reach you,
for they will find the advantage which you anticipate. Let there be
among you a person of awareness— when the fruit ripened, he came quickly
with his sickle in his hand,</strong>¹ <strong>he reaped it. Whoever has
ears to hear, let him hear!</strong> (¹asyndeton; =Mt 24:43-44;)</p>
<p><strong>22.  Yeshúa sees little children who are being suckled. He
says to his Disciples: These little children who are being suckled are
like those who enter the Sovereignty. || They say to him:  Shall we thus
by becoming little children enter the Sovereignty? || Yeshúa says to
them: When you make the two one, and you make the inside as the outside
and the outside as the inside and the above as the below, and if you
establish the male with the female as a single unity so that the man
will not be masculine and the woman not be feminine, when you
establish</strong> [<strong>an eye</strong>] <strong>in the  place of an
eye and a hand in the place of a hand and a foot in the place of a foot
and an image</strong> <strong>in the place of an image— then shall you
enter</strong> [<strong>the Sovereignty</strong>]<strong>.</strong> (Mt
18:3; ; =Clement of Alexandria, <a
href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0210.htm"><em>Stromata</em></a>
III.13; cp. <a
href="http://www.goodnewsinc.net/othbooks/odesolmn.html">Odes of
St. Solomon</a> 34:5, ‘The likeness of what is below, is  that which is
above— for everything is above; what is below is nothing but the 
delusion of those who are without knowledge’; also Socrates in Plato's
Phaedrus,
‘Beloved Pan, and whatever other gods be present, grant me to be
handsome in inward soul, and that the outside and the inside be
one’;)</p>
<p><strong>23.  Yeshúa says: I shall choose you, one from a thousand and
two from ten thousand— and they shall stand as a single unity.</strong>
(Dt 32:30, Job 33:23, Ecc 7:28;)</p>
<p><strong>24.  His Disciples say: Show us thy place, for it is
compulsory for us to seek it. || He says to them: Whoever has ears, let
him hear! Within a person of light there is light, and he illumines the
entire world. When he does not shine, there is darkness.</strong> (Mt
5:14-16, Jn 13:36;)</p>
<p><strong>25.  Yeshúa says: Love thy Brother as thy soul, protect him
as the pupil of thine eye.</strong> (asyndeton; Dt 32:10, I-Sam 18:1, Ps
17:8, Jn 13:34-35; thus the <a
href="http://www.iging.com/intro/introduc.htm"><em>I Ching</em></a>,
hexagram 63, After Completion: ‘Indifference is the root of all
evil’;)</p>
<p><strong>26.  Yeshúa says: The mote which is in thy Brother's eye thou
see— but the plank that is in thine own eye thou see not. When thou cast
the plank out of thine own eye, then shall thou see clearly to cast the
mote out of thy Brother's eye.</strong> (=Mt 7:3-5;)</p>
<p><strong>27. </strong> (<strong>Yeshúa says:</strong>) <strong>Unless
you fast from the system, you shall not find the Sovereignty</strong>
{<strong>of God</strong>}<strong>. Unless you keep the</strong>
(<strong>entire</strong>) <strong>week</strong>¹ <strong>as
Sabbath</strong> <strong>, you shall not behold the Father.</strong> (Mk
1:13, Jn 5:19!; =Clement of Alexandria, <a
href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0210.htm"><em>Stromata</em></a>
III.15; ¹here ‘Sabbath’ = ‘week’ as in Lev 23:15-16— see P133 and
Paterson Brown, ‘The Sabbath and the Week in Thomas 27’, <em>Novum
Testamentum</em> 1992;)</p>
<p><strong>28.  Yeshúa says: I stood in the midst of the world, and
incarnate</strong> <strong>I appeared to them.</strong>¹ <strong>I found
them all drunk, I found none among them athirst. And my soul was grieved
for the sons of men, for they are blind in their hearts and do not see
that empty they have come into the world and that empty they are
destined to come forth again from the world.</strong> (Ecc
6:15)<strong>However, now they are drunk— when they have shaken off
their wine, then shall they rethink</strong> . (¹anti-Gnostic!, Jn 1:14;
this appears to be a post-resurrection saying;)</p>
<p><strong>29.  Yeshúa says: If the flesh has come to be because of
spirit, it is a marvel— yet if spirit because of the body, it would be a
marvel among marvels. But I marvel at this, how this great wealth has
inhabited this poverty.</strong> (Ph 23;)</p>
<p><strong>30.  Yeshúa says: Where there are three gods, they
are</strong> {<strong>godless. Where there is only one, I say
that</strong>} <strong>I myself am with him.</strong> {<strong>Raise the
stone and there you shall find me, cleave the wood and there am
I.</strong>} (see e.g.
The Letter
of Aristeas 15-16; cleaving the wood could be seen as a metaphor for
the crucifixion, removing the stone for the resurrection;)</p>
<p><strong>31.  Yeshúa says: No oracle</strong> <strong>is accepted in
his own village, no physician heals those who know him.</strong>
(asyndeton; =Mk 6:4;)</p>
<p><strong>32.  Yeshúa says: A city being built upon a high mountain and
fortified cannot fall nor can it be hidden.</strong> (Mt 5:14;)</p>
<p><strong>33.  Yeshúa says: What thou shall hear in thy ear proclaim to
other ears from your rooftops. For no one kindles a lamp and sets it
under a basket nor puts it in a hidden place, but rather it is placed
upon the lampstand so that everyone who comes in and goes out will see
its light.</strong> (=Mt 5:15, =10:27, =Mk 4:21;)</p>
<p><strong>34.  Yeshúa says: If a blind person leads a blind person,
both together fall into a pit.</strong> (=Mt 15:14;)</p>
<p><strong>35.  Yeshúa says: It is impossible for anyone to enter the
house of the strong to take it by force, unless he binds his hands— then
he will ransack his house.</strong> (Isa 49:24-25, =Mk 3:27;)</p>
<p><strong>36.  Yeshúa says: Be not anxious in the morning about the
evening nor in the evening about the morning,</strong> {<strong>neither
for your</strong> [<strong>food</strong>] <strong>that you shall eat nor
for</strong> [<strong>your garments</strong>] <strong>that you shall
wear. You are much superior to the</strong>
[<strong>windflowers</strong>] <strong>which neither comb</strong>
(<strong>wool</strong>) <strong>nor</strong> [<strong>spin</strong>]
(<strong>thread</strong>)<strong>. When you have no clothing, what
do</strong> [<strong>you wear</strong>]<strong>? Or who can increase
your stature? He himself shall give to you your garment.</strong>}
(garment = imagery?!: see Th 37, 84, Ph 26, 107, ‘Angel and Image’, as
well as the ancient and delightful ‘Hymn of the Pearl’; =Mt 6:25;)</p>
<p><strong>37.  His Disciples say: When will thou appear to us, and when
shall we behold thee? || Yeshúa says: When you take off your garments
without being ashamed, and take your garments and place them under your
feet to tread on them as the little children do— then</strong>
[<strong>shall you behold</strong>] <strong>the Son of the Living-One,
and you shall not fear.</strong> (Gen 2:25, 3:7, Isa 19:2; =Clement of
Alexandria, <em><a
href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0210.htm">Stromata</a></em>
III.13; garments = images?!; this appears to be a post-resurrection
dialog;)</p>
<p><strong>38.  Yeshúa says: Many times have you yearned to hear these
sayings which I speak to you, and you have no one else from whom to hear
them. There will be days when you will seek me but you shall not find
me.</strong> (Prov 1:28, Lk 17:22;)</p>
<p><strong>39.  Yeshúa says: The clergy</strong> <strong>and the
theologians</strong> <strong>have received the keys of recognition, but
they have hidden them. They did not enter, nor did they permit those to
enter who wished to. Yet you— become astute as serpents and pure as
doves.</strong> (Mt 5:20, 23:1-39, =Lk 11:52, =Mt 10:16;)</p>
<p><strong>40.  Yeshúa says: A vine has been planted without the Father,
and as it is not viable it shall be pulled up by its roots and
destroyed.</strong> (Mt 15:13;)</p>
<p><strong>41.  Yeshúa says: Whoever has in his hand, to him
shall</strong> (<strong>more</strong>) <strong>be given. And whoever
does not have, from him shall be taken even the trifle which he
has.</strong> (=Mt 13:12;)</p>
<p><strong>42.  Yeshúa says: Be passers-by</strong> <strong>.</strong>
(Mt 10:1-23, 28:19-20, Jn 16:28; thus 
Matsuo Basho,
<em>Narrow Road to the Interior</em>: ‘Every day is a journey, and the
journey itself is home’; <a
href="https://poets.org/poet/sylvia-plath">Sylvia
Plath</a>, <em>Unabridged Journals</em>: ‘I can only pass on. Something
in me wants more.… There is still time to veer, to sally forth, knapsack
on back, for unknown hills over which ··· only the wind knows what
lies’; <a href="http://www.ensayistas.org/consejo/chamizo/">Pedro
Chamizo Domínguez</a>, <em>Metaphor and Knowledge</em>: ‘Man is not
usually satisfied with what is known in each moment, but rather in every
moment what is understood and established as true appears to him
insufficient’;)</p>
<p><strong>43.  His Disciples say to him: Who art thou, that thou say
these things to us? ||</strong> (<strong>Yeshúa says to them:</strong>)
<strong>From what I say to you, you do not recognize who I be, but
rather you have become as the Jews— for they love the tree but hate its
fruit, and they love the fruit but hate the tree.</strong> (Mt 12:33, Jn
4:22;)</p>
<p><strong>44.  Yeshúa says: Whoever vilifies the Father, it shall be
forgiven him. And whoever vilifies the Son, it shall be forgiven him.
Yet whoever vilifies the Holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven him—
neither on earth nor in heaven.</strong> (=Mk 3:28-29;)</p>
<p><strong>45.  Yeshúa says: They do not harvest grapes from thorns, nor
do they gather figs from thistles— for they give no fruit. A good person
brings forth goodness out of his treasure. A bad person brings forth
wickedness</strong> <strong>out of his evil treasure which is in his
heart, and he speaks oppressively— for out of the abundance of the heart
he brings forth wickedness.</strong> (I-Sam 24:13, =Mt 7:16,
=12:34-35;)</p>
<p><strong>46.  Yeshúa says: From Adam</strong> <strong>until John the
Baptist</strong> <strong>there is among those born of women none more
exalted than John the Baptist— so that his eyes shall not be broken. Yet
I have said that whoever among you becomes childlike shall know the
Sovereignty, and he shall become more exalted than John.</strong> (Th
15, =Lk 7:28;)</p>
<p><strong>47.  Yeshúa says: It is impossible for a person to mount two
horses or to stretch two bows, and a slave cannot serve two
masters</strong> <strong>— otherwise he will honor the one and offend
the other. No person drinks vintage</strong> <strong>wine and
immediately desires to drink new wine, and they do not put new</strong>
(<strong>wine</strong>) <strong>into old wineskins lest they burst, and
they do not put vintage wine into new wineskins lest it sour. They do
not sew an old patch on a new garment because there would come a
split.</strong> (Job 32:19, =Lk 5:36-39, =16:13;)</p>
<p><strong>48.  Yeshúa says: If two make peace with each other in this
one house, they shall say to the mountain: Be moved!— and it shall be
moved.</strong> (=Mt 17:20, =18:19;)</p>
<p><strong>49.  Yeshúa says: Blest be the solitary and chosen— for you
shall find the Sovereignty. You have come from it, and unto it you shall
return.</strong> (Jn 16:28; cp. Plotinus, <a
href="http://classics.mit.edu/Plotinus/enneads.1.first.html"><em>Enneads</em></a>,
I.6.8: ‘The Fatherland to us is there whence we have come, and there is

<p><strong>50.  Yeshúa says: If they say to you: ‘From whence do you
come?’, say to them: ’We have come from the Light, the place where the
Light has originated thru himself— he</strong> [<strong>stood</strong>]
<strong>and he himself appeared in their imagery.’ If they say to you:
‘Who are you?’, say: ‘We are his Sons and we are the chosen of the
Living Father.’ If they ask you: ‘What is the sign of your Father in
you?’, say to them: ‘It is movement with repose.’</strong> (Lk 16:8, Jn
12:36, Th 28;)</p>
<p><strong>51.  His Disciples say to him: When will the repose of the
dead occur, and when will the New World come? || He says to them: That
which you look for has already come, but you do not recognize
it.</strong></p>
<p><strong>52.  His Disciples say to him: Twenty-four prophets</strong>
<strong>proclaimed in Israel, and they all spoke within thee. || He says
to them: You have ignored the Living-One who is facing you, and you have
spoken about the dead.</strong> (Th 5;)</p>
<p><strong>53.  His Disciples say to him: Is circumcision beneficial or
not? || He says to them: If it were beneficial, their father would beget
them circumcised from their mother. But the true spiritual circumcision
has become entirely beneficial.</strong></p>
<p><strong>54.  Yeshúa says: Blest be the poor, for the Sovereignty of
the Skies is yours.</strong> (Jas 2:5-7, =Lk 6:20; note that the Greek
of Mt 5:3, MAKARIOI OI PTWCOI TW PNEUMATI, can be read equally ‘Blest
the poor in spirit’ or ‘Blest in spirit the poor’— of which the latter
makes more sense, since the parallel at Lk 6:20&amp;24 explicitly
concerns economic poverty/wealth rather than spiritual
humility/pride;)</p>
<p><strong>55.  Yeshúa says: Whoever does not hate his father and his
mother will not be able to become a Disciple to me. And whoever does not
hate his brothers and his sisters and does not take up his own
cross</strong>¹ <strong>in my way, will not become worthy of
me.</strong> (¹anti-Gnostic; =Lk 14:26-27;)</p>
<p><strong>56.  Yeshúa says: Whoever has recognized the system has found
a corpse— and whoever has found a corpse, of him the system is not
worthy.</strong></p>
<p><strong>57.  Yeshúa says: The Sovereignty of the Father is like a
person who has</strong> [<strong>good</strong>] <strong>seed. His enemy
came by night,</strong>¹ <strong>he sowed a weed among the good seed.
The man did not permit them to pull up the weed,</strong>¹ <strong>he
says to them: Lest perhaps you go forth saying: ‘We shall pull up the
weed’, and you pull up the wheat along with it. For on the day of
harvest the weeds will appear— they pull them and burn them.</strong>
(¹asyndeton; II-Pt 3:15-17?!, =Mt 13:24-30;)</p>
<p><strong>58.  Yeshúa says: Blest be the person who has suffered— he
has found the life.</strong> (asyndeton; Mt 5:10-12, Jas 1:12, I-Pt
3:14; thus Victor Hugo,
Les
Misérables</em>: ‘To have suffered, how good it is!’;)</p>
<p><strong>59.  Yeshúa says: Behold the Living-One while you are alive,
lest you die and seek to perceive him and be unable to see.</strong>
(Ecc 12:1-8;)</p>
<p><strong>60. </strong> (<strong>They see</strong>) <strong>a
Samaritan</strong> <strong>carrying a lamb, entering Judea. Yeshúa says
to them: Why does he</strong> (<strong>take</strong>) <strong>the lamb
with him? || They say to him: So that he may kill it and eat it. || He
says to them: While it is alive he will not eat it, but only after he
kills it and it becomes a corpse. || They say: Otherwise he will not be
able to do it. || He says to them: You yourselves— seek a place for
yourselves in repose, lest you become corpses and be eaten.</strong> (Th
1; thus Thomas Mann, <em>The Magic Mountain</em>: ‘The spiritual
possibility of finding salvation in repose’;)</p>
<p><strong>61a.  Yeshúa says: Two will rest on a bed</strong>°<strong>—
the one shall die, the other shall live.</strong> (asyndeton; =Lk
17:34;)</p>
<p><strong>61b.  Salome</strong> <strong>says: Who art thou, man? As
if</strong> (<strong>sent</strong>) <strong>by someone, thou laid upon
my bed</strong> <strong>and thou ate from my table.</strong>¹ <strong>||
Yeshúa says to her: I-Am he who is from equality. To me have been given
from the things of my Father. ||</strong> (<strong>Salome
says:</strong>) <strong>I'm thy Disciple.</strong>² <strong>||</strong>
(<strong>Yeshúa says to her:</strong>) <strong>Thus I say that whenever
someone equalizes he shall be filled with light, yet whenever he
differentiates he shall be filled with darkness.</strong> (¹S-of-S 1:4;
cp. Teresa of Ávila,
<em>The
Interior Castle</em>, VI.4.1: ‘All is to desire to enjoy the Husband
more,... to be ardent to mate with such a grand Lord and take him as
Husband’; ²’thy Disciple’: Coptic tek. indicates a masculine possessive
[thy] of a feminine noun [disciple]— see P050)</p>
<p><strong>62.  Yeshúa says: I tell my mysteries to those</strong>
[<strong>who are worthy of</strong>] <strong>my mysteries. What thy
right</strong> (<strong>hand</strong>) <strong>shall do, let not thy
left</strong> (<strong>hand</strong>) <strong>ascertain what it
does.</strong> (Mk 4:10-12, =Mt 6:3;)</p>
<p><strong>63.  Yeshúa says: There was a wealthy person who possessed
much money, and he said: I shall utilize my money so that I may sow and
reap and replant, to fill my storehouses with fruit so that I lack
nothing. This is what he thought in his heart— and that night he died.
Whoever has ears, let him hear!</strong> (=Lk 12:16-21;)</p>
<p><strong>64a.  Yeshúa says: A person had houseguests, and when he had
prepared the banquet he sent his slave to invite the guests. He went to
the first, he says to him: My master invites thee. He replied: I have
some business with some merchants, they are coming to me in the evening,
I shall go to place my orders with them— I beg to be excused from the
banquet. He went to another, he says to him: My master has invited thee.
He replied to him: I have bought a house and they require me for a day,
I shall have no leisure time. He came to another, he says to him: My
master invites thee. He replied to him: My comrade is to be married and
I must arrange a feast, I shall not be able to come— I beg to be excused
from the banquet. He went to another, he says to him: My master invites
thee. He replied to him: I have bought a villa, I go to receive the
rent, I shall not be able to come— I beg to be excused. The slave came,
he said to his master: Those whom thou have invited to the banquet have
excused themselves. The master said to his slave: Go out to the roads,
bring those whom thou shall find so that they may feast.</strong>
(multiple asyndeta; =Lk 14:16-23;)</p>
<p><strong>64b.</strong> (<strong>And he says:</strong>)
<strong>Tradesmen and merchants shall not enter the places of my
Father.</strong> (Ezek 27-28, Zeph 1:11, Zech 14:21, Jn 2:13-16, Rev/Ap
18:11-20;)</p>
<p><strong>65.  He says: A kind</strong> <strong>person had a vineyard.
He gave it out to tenants so that they would work it and he would
receive its fruit from them. He sent his slave so that the tenants would
give to him the fruit of the vineyard. They seized his slave, they beat
him— a little longer and they would have killed him. The slave went, he
told it to his master. His master said: Perhaps</strong>
[<strong>they</strong>] <strong>did not recognize</strong>
[<strong>him</strong>]<strong>. He sent another slave— the tenants beat
him also. Then the owner sent his son. He said: Perhaps they will
respect my son. Since those tenants knew that he was the heir of the
vineyard, they seized him, they killed him. Whoever has ears, let him
hear!</strong> (multiple asyndeta; =Mk 12:1-8;)</p>
<p><strong>66.  Yeshúa says: Show me the stone which the builders have
rejected— it is the cornerstone.</strong> (Isa 28:16, =Ps 118:22 ® Mt
21:42;)</p>
<p><strong>67.  Yeshúa says: Whoever knows everything but himself, lacks
everything.</strong> (Th 3;)</p>
<p><strong>68.  Yeshúa says: Blest be you when you are hated and
persecuted and find no place there where you have been
persecuted.</strong> (Mt 5:10-12;)</p>
<p><strong>69a.  Yeshúa says: Blest be those who have been persecuted in
their heart— these are they who have recognized the Father in
truth.</strong> (<em>ibid</em>.;)</p>
<p><strong>69b. </strong> (<strong>Yeshúa says:</strong>) <strong>Blest
be the hungry, for the stomach of him who desires shall be
filled.</strong> (Mt 5:6;)</p>
<p><strong>70.  Yeshúa says: When you bring forth that which is within
you, this that you have shall save you. If you do not have that within
you, this which you do not have within you will kill you.</strong> (Lk
11:41!;)</p>
<p><strong>71.  Yeshúa says: I shall destroy</strong>
[<strong>this</strong>] <strong>house, and no one will be able
to</strong> [<strong>re</strong>]<strong>build it.</strong> (Mk 14:58,

Tell my brothers to divide the possessions of my father with me. || He
says to him: Oh man, who made me a divider? || He turned to his
Disciples,</strong>¹ <strong>he says to them: I'm not a divider, am
I?</strong> (¹asyndeton; Lk 12:13-14;)</p>
<p><strong>73.  Yeshúa says: The harvest is indeed plentiful, but the
workers are few. Yet beseech the Lord</strong> <strong>that he send
workers into the harvest.</strong> (=Mt 9:37-38;)</p>

no one in the reservoir.</strong></p>
<p><strong>75.  Yeshúa says: There are many standing at the door, but
the solitary are those who shall enter the Bridal-Chamber</strong>
<strong>.</strong> (Mt 9:15, 25:10, Th 16, 49;)</p>
<p><strong>76.  Yeshúa says: The Sovereignty of the Father is like a
merchant possessing a fortune, who found a pearl. That merchant was
shrewd— he sold the fortune, he bought the one pearl for himself. You
yourselves, seek for</strong> [<strong>the treasure of his
face</strong>]<strong>, which perishes not, which endures— the place
where no moth comes near to devour nor worm ravages.</strong> (multiple
asyndeta; Ps 11:7, 17:15, =Mt 6:19-20, =13:44-46, =Lk 12:33;)</p>
<p><strong>77.  Yeshúa says: I-Am the Light who is above them all, I-Am
the All</strong> <strong>. All came forth from me and all return to me.
Cleave wood,</strong>¹ <strong>there am I. Lift up the stone and there
you shall find me.</strong> (¹asyndeton; Jn 8:12, Th 30 note; thus Lao
Tzu,<em>Tao Teh Ching</em> 16:
‘All things flourish, but each one returns to its root,... the eternal
Tao’; and Victor Hugo,
Les
Misérables</em>: ‘All comes from light, and all returns to it’;)</p>
<p><strong>78.  Yeshúa says: Why did you come out to the wilderness— to
see a reed shaken by the wind? And to see a person dressed in plush
garments?</strong> [<strong>Behold, your</strong>] <strong>rulers and
your dignitaries are those who are clad in plush garments, and they
shall not be able to recognize the truth.</strong> (=Mt 11:7-8;)</p>
<p><strong>79.  A woman from the multitude says to him: Blest be the
womb which bore thee, and the breasts which nursed thee! || He says
to</strong> [<strong>her</strong>]<strong>: Blest be those who have
heard the meaning</strong> <strong>of the Father and have kept it in
truth. For there shall be days when you will say: Blest be the womb
which has not conceived and the breasts which have not nursed.</strong>
(Lk 1:42, 23:29, =11:27-28;)</p>
<p><strong>80.  Yeshúa says: Whoever has recognized the system has found
the body— and whoever has found the body, of him the system is not
worthy.</strong> (Th 56;)</p>
<p><strong>81.  Yeshúa says: Let whoever is enriched become sovereign,
and let whoever has power renounce it.</strong></p>
<p><strong>82.  Yeshúa says: Whoever is close to me is close to the
fire, and whoever is far from me is far from the
Sovereignty.</strong></p>
<p><strong>83.  Yeshúa says: The images are manifest to mankind, and the
Light which is within them is hidden.</strong> (Th 19)<strong>He shall
reveal himself in the imagery of the Light of the Father— and</strong>
(<strong>yet</strong>) <strong>his image is concealed by his
Light.</strong> (thus Victor Hugo,
<em>Les
Misérables</em>: ‘God is behind all things, but all things hide
God’; Ps 104:2!;)</p>
<p><strong>84. Yeshúa says: When you see your reflection, you
rejoice.</strong>¹ <strong>Yet when you perceive your images which have
come into being in your presence— which neither die nor
manifest</strong> <strong>— to what extent will they depend upon
you?</strong>² (this is the epistemological [and thus ontological] hinge
of the entire text; see Ps 139:16, Prov 20:24, Jn 5:19, Th 19, and
‘Angel and Image’; ¹thus Anton Chekhov, ‘Anna’: ‘When Anna ... in the
enormous mirror saw the whole of herself, illumined by countless lights,
a feeling of joy awakened in her soul’; ²cp. Chuang Chou [4th century BC
China], <em>Chuang Tzu</em> 2: ‘Joy, anger, grief, delight, worry,
regret, fickleness, inflexibility, modesty, volition, sincerity,
insolence:... without them we would not exist, without us they have
nothing to take hold of;... it would seem as though they have some True
Master, and yet I find no trace of him; he can act— that is certain; yet
I cannot see his form; he has identity but no form’;)</p>
<p><strong>85.  Yeshúa says: Adam came into existence from a great power
and a great wealth, and yet he did not become worthy of you. For if he

<strong>not</strong> [<strong>have tasted</strong>]
<strong>death.</strong> (Th 1;)</p>
<p><strong>86.  Yeshúa says:</strong> [<strong>The foxes have their
dens</strong>] <strong>and the birds have</strong>

place to lay his head for rest.</strong> (Dan 7:13-14, =Mt 8:20;)</p>
<p><strong>87.  Yeshúa says: Wretched be the body which depends
upon</strong> (<strong>another</strong>) <strong>body, and wretched be
the soul which depends upon their being together.</strong></p>
<p><strong>88.  Yeshúa says: The angels and the oracles shall come to
you, and they shall bestow upon you what is yours. And you yourselves,
give to them what is in your hands, and say among yourselves: On what
day will they come to receive what is theirs?</strong> (Rev/Ap
21:17!;)</p>
<p><strong>89.  Yeshúa says: Why do you wash the outside of the chalice?

shall find repose for yourselves.</strong> (Mt 11:28-30, Th 60;)</p>
<p><strong>91.  They say to him: Tell us who thou art, so that we may
believe in thee. || He says to them: You scrutinize the face of the sky

you do not know to inquire of Him at this moment.</strong> (Th 5, 52,
76, 84, =Lk 12:56;)</p>
<p><strong>92.  Yeshúa says: Seek and you shall find. But those things
which you asked me in those days, I did not tell you then. Now I wish to
tell them, and you do not inquire about them.</strong> (=Mt 7:7-8; thus
Mencius, 4th century BC China: ‘It is said, Seek and you will find it,
neglect and you will lose it’;)</p>
<p><strong>93.</strong> (<strong>Yeshúa says:</strong>) <strong>Give not
what is sacred to the dogs, lest they throw it on the dungheap. Cast not
the pearls to the swine, lest they cause it to become</strong>
[...]<strong>.</strong> (=Mt 7:6;9)</p>
<p><strong>94.  Yeshúa</strong> [<strong>says:</strong>] <strong>Whoever
seeks shall find.</strong> [<strong>And whoever knocks,</strong>]
<strong>it shall be opened to him.</strong> (=Mt 7:8;)</p>
<p><strong>95.</strong> [<strong>Yeshúa says:</strong>] <strong>If you
have copper-coins,</strong>¹<strong>do not lend at interest— but rather
give</strong> [<strong>them</strong>] <strong>to those from whom you
will not be repaid.</strong> (Lk 6:30-36; ¹here in the bound codex there
is a single sheet puzzlingly blank on both sides;)</p>
<p><strong>96.  Yeshúa</strong> [<strong>says</strong>]<strong>: The
Sovereignty of the Father is like</strong> [<strong>a</strong>]
<strong>woman,</strong>¹ <strong>she has taken a little yeast,</strong>¹
<strong>she</strong> [<strong>has hidden</strong>] <strong>it in
dough,</strong>¹ <strong>she produced large loaves of it. Whoever has
ears, let him hear!</strong> (¹asyndeta; =Mt 13:33;)</p>
<p><strong>97.  Yeshúa says: The Sovereignty of the</strong>
[<strong>Father</strong>] <strong>is like a woman who was carrying a jar
full of grain. While she was walking</strong> [<strong>on a</strong>]
<strong>distant road, the handle of the jar broke, the grain streamed
out behind her onto the road. She did not know it, she had noticed no
accident. When she arrived in her house, she set the jar down— she found
it empty.</strong> (multiple asyndeta;)</p>
<p><strong>98.  Yeshúa says: The Sovereignty of the Father is like
someone who wishes to slay a prominent person. He drew forth his sword
in his house,</strong>¹ <strong>he thrust it into the wall in order to
ascertain whether his hand would prevail. Then he slew the prominent
person.</strong> (¹asyndeton; Rev/Ap 1:16, 2:16!;)</p>
<p><strong>99.  His Disciples say to him: Thy brethren and thy mother
are standing outside. || He says to them: Those here who practice the
desires of my Father— these are my Brethren and my Mother. It is they
who shall enter the Sovereignty of my Father.</strong> (Th 15, =Mt
3:31-35;)</p>
<p><strong>100.  They show Yeshúa a gold-coin, and they say to him: The
agents of Caesar extort tribute from us. || He says to them: Give the
things of Caesar to Caesar, give the things of God to God, and give to
me what is mine.</strong> (Rev/Ap 13:18 ¬ I-Ki 10:14?!; an extraordinary
gematria, indicating 666 as a <em>monetary</em> symbol; =Mt 22:16-21, Th
64b;)</p>
<p><strong>101. </strong> (<strong>Yeshúa says:</strong>)
<strong>Whoever does not hate his father and his mother in my way, shall
not be able to become a Disciple to me. And whoever does</strong>
[<strong>not</strong>] <strong>love his</strong>
[<strong>Father</strong>] <strong>and his Mother in my way, shall not be
able to become a Disciple to me. For my mother</strong>
[<strong>bore</strong> <strong>me</strong>]¹<strong>, yet</strong>
[<strong>my</strong>] <strong>true</strong>² [<strong>Mother</strong>]
<strong>gave me the life.</strong> (Job 33:4; ¹the reconstruction of
this phrase in the papyrus; ²m.me = ‘of truth’ [if me is feminine] or
‘of love’ [if it is masculine]— here undetermined, as there is no
definite article [C156]; Jn 2:4, Th 15, 79, 99, =Lk 14:26; see ‘The
Maternal Spirit’ and ‘Theogenesis’; cp. <a

St. Solomon</a> 35:6— ‘I was carried like a child by its mother’;)</p>
<p><strong>102.  Yeshúa says: Woe unto them, the clergy— for they are
like a dog sleeping in the manger of oxen. For neither does he eat, nor
does he allow the oxen to eat.</strong> (Th 39;
<em>The
Fables</em></a> of Aesop ;)
<p><strong>103.  Yeshúa says: Blest be the person who knows in</strong>
[<strong>which</strong>] <strong>part the bandits may invade, so that he
shall arise and collect his</strong> [<strong>things</strong>]
<strong>and gird up his loins before they enter.</strong> (=Lk 12:35
&amp; 39;)</p>
<p><strong>104.  They say</strong> [<strong>to him:</strong>]
<strong>Come, let us pray today and let us fast. || Yeshúa says: Which
then is the transgression that I have committed, or in what have I been
vanquished? But when the Bridegroom comes forth from the Bridal-Chamber,
then let them fast and let them pray.</strong> (Mk 2:19-20, Th 14;)</p>
<p><strong>105.  Yeshúa says: Whoever acknowledges father and mother,

8:41, Th 101, ‘Theogenesis’;)</p>
<p><strong>106.  Yeshúa says: When you make the two
one</strong>¹<strong>, you shall become Sons of
Mankind</strong>²<strong>— and when you say to the mountain: Be moved!,
it shall be moved.</strong> (¹Th 22, cp. the <em>Tao Te Ching</em> 1 of Lao
Tsu; ‘These two are the same’; ²Dan 7:13-14, Th 86;)</p>
<p><strong>107.  Yeshúa says: The Sovereignty is like a shepherd who has
100 sheep. One of them went astray, which was the largest. He left the
99, he sought for the one until he found it. Having wearied himself, he
said to that sheep: I desire thee more than 99.</strong> (Ezek 34:15-16,
=Lk 15:3-6;)</p>
<p><strong>108.  Yeshúa says: Whoever drinks from my mouth shall become
like me. I myself shall become him, and the secrets shall be manifest to
him.</strong> (Lk 6:40, Jn 4:7-15, 7:37;)</p>
<p><strong>109.  Yeshúa says: The Sovereignty is like a person who has a
treasure</strong> [<strong>hidden</strong>] <strong>in his field without
knowing it. And</strong> [<strong>after</strong>] <strong>he died, he
bequeathed it to his</strong> [<strong>son. The</strong>] <strong>son
did not know</strong> (<strong>about it</strong>) <strong>, he accepted
that field, he sold</strong> [<strong>it</strong>]<strong>. And he came
who purchased it— he plowed it,</strong> [<strong>he found</strong>]
<strong>the treasure. He began to lend money at interest to whomever he
wishes.</strong> (multiple asyndeta;
<em>The
Fables</em> of Aesop, Mt 13:44;)</p>
<p><strong>110.  Yeshúa says: Whoever has found the system and been
enriched, let him renounce the system.</strong> (Th 81;)</p>
<p><strong>111.  Yeshúa says: The sky and the earth shall be rolled up
in your presence. And he who lives from within the Living-One shall see
neither death</strong> [<strong>nor fear</strong>]<strong>— for Yeshúa
says: Whoever finds himself, of him the world is not worthy.</strong>
(Isa 34:4, Lk 21:33, Rev/Ap 6:14;)</p>
<p><strong>112.  Yeshúa says: Woe to the flesh which depends upon the
soul, woe to the soul which depends upon the flesh.</strong> (asyndeton;
Th 87;)</p>
<p><strong>113.  His Disciples say to him: When will the Sovereignty
come? ||</strong> (<strong>Yeshúa says:</strong>) <strong>It shall not
come by expectation. They will not say: Behold here! or: Behold there!
But the Sovereignty of the Father is spread upon the earth, and humans
do not perceive it.</strong> (Lk 17:20-21, Th 51; thus Henry David
Thoreau, <em>Walden</em>: ‘Heaven is under our feet as well as over our
heads’;)</p>
<p><strong>114.  Shimon Kefa says to them: Let Mariam depart from among
us, for women are not worthy of the life. || Yeshúa says: Behold, I
shall entice</strong> <strong>her so that I make her male, in order that
she herself shall become a living spirit like you males. For every
female who becomes male shall enter the Sovereignty of the
Heavens.</strong> (Gen 3:16, Th 22; cp. [remarkably] English ‘tomboy’;
thus Clement of Alexandria, <em><a

are given in marriage [Lk 14:34-36]; and is not woman transformed into
man, when she is become equally unfeminine, and manly, and
perfect?’;)</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Notes to Thomas</strong></p>
<p>        Coptic was the final stage of the classical Egyptian
language, evolving after the invasion of Alexander the Great (332 BC)
and subsequently supplanted by Arabic following the Muslim conquest (640
AD). It has always been the liturgical language of the Egyptian Church;
moreover, the ancient Coptic versions of the Old and New Testaments are
of great importance in textual Biblical studies. Utilizing many Greek
loan words, Coptic also adopted the Greek alphabet (with s for S, and w
for W), adding these letters: 4 (shai), 3 (fai), 6 (hori), `(janja), 2
(gima), 5 (ti), and ¯ (syllable or abbreviation indicator); see P001.

for KRABBATOS.<br />
        <strong>Blest</strong> (7,18,19,49,54,58,68,69a,69b,79,103):
Greek MAKARIOS; this Greek word means divine, rather than merely human,
beatitude (Mt 5:3 et passim).<br />
        <strong>Bridal-Chamber</strong> (75,104): Coptic ma n.4eleet
(place of-bride; C153a, C560b) = Greek NUMFWN = Hebrew rdx
(<em>kheder</em>); the bedroom where the marriage is consummated (Jud
15:1, Ps 19:5, 45:13-15!, S-of-S 1:4, Jn 3:29!, Mt 9:15 [OI UIOI TOU
NUMFWNOS, the Sons of the Bridal-Chamber], 25:1-13)— see Ph
65,71,72,73,82,94,101,108,131,143, Sacrament in Ph Notes.<br />
        <strong>Clergy</strong> (39,102): Aramaic My#wrp
(<em>perushím</em>, ‘Pharisees’: separated); religious leaders; Mt 5:20,
23:1-39, etc.<br />
        <strong>Entice</strong> (114): Coptic sok (to blow as the wind
or to flow as water, hence to draw or attract; C325), as in Jn 6:44
(Greek ELKW).<br />
        <strong>Everything</strong> (6,67): see Totality.<br />
        <strong>Gnostic</strong> (5): re the <em>anti-Gnosticism</em> of
these texts, see Incarnate and Recognition, Th 5,28,55; Ph
25,72,77,78,98,101,114,132,137; Tr 6,8,9,10,21,28,29,37— ‘Gnosticism’ is
by definition metaphysically Platonic, maintaining that both the sensory
universe and all incarnation are <em>illusory</em>; our texts, on the
contrary, share the Biblical view that both the perceptual universe and
all incarnations are <em>divinely created</em>.<br />
        <strong>Heaven</strong> (20,44,114): see Sky.<br />
        <strong>Holy Spirit</strong> (44): Hebrew #dq-h xwr (<em>ruakh
ha-qodesh</em>, Spirit the-Holy; feminine gender) = Greek PNEUMA TO
AGION (neuter gender) = Coptic p.pneuma et.ouaab (P080, masculine
gender; as also Latin SPIRITUS SANCTUS); see Spirit and ‘The Maternal
Spirit’.<br />
        <strong>Image/Imagery</strong> (22,50,83,84): Greek EIKON
(similitude) = Hebrew Mlc (<em>tselem</em>, shadow; Gen 1:26); sensory
perceptions and/or mental images, the five senses (Th 19!) together with
memory and the imagination; see ‘Angel and Image’.<br />
        <strong>Incarnate</strong> (28): Coptic 6n sarc (‘in flesh’—
utilizing the Greek term from Jn 1:14, SARX); thus <strong>blatantly
anti-Gnostic</strong>; see Gnosticism<em>.</em><br />
        <strong>Jacob the Righteous</strong> (12): Hebrew bq(y
(<em>yakov</em>: heeler, supplanter; Gen 25:26) = Greek IAKWBOS =
English ‘James’; Christ's human brother (Mk 6:3, Jn 7:5, Ac 1:14, 12:17,
Jas 1:1).<br />
        <strong>John the Baptist</strong> (46,78): John = Hebrew Nnxwy
(<em>yokhanan</em>: Yah is gracious); the last Hebrew prophet and the
Messianic precursor (Lk 1,3,7), see Oracle, Ph 73,81,133, Baptism in Ph
Notes, Logia in Tr Notes.<br />
        <strong>Kind</strong> (65): see Vintage.<br />
        <strong>Lord/Master</strong> (47,64a,65,73,74): Hebrew Nwd)
(<em>adón</em>) = Greek KURIOS = Coptic `oeis; C787b, owner of a
slave.<br />
        <strong>Manifest</strong> (84): Coptic ouwn6 ebol (show forth
[in the transitive and non-reflexive sense], C486b)— i.e. indicate
something which is both beyond itself and unperceived; see ‘Angel and
Image’.<br />
        <strong>Mariam</strong> (21,114): from Hebrew Mwrm
(<em>mrom</em>: exalted; Ex 15:20); five females named Mariam appear in
the Gospels: the Virgin, Mariam Magdalene, Mariam of Bethany, Mariam of
Cleopas, and Mariam the Lord's human sister (Mc 6:3, Ph 36); the oldest
and best manuscripts of e.g. Jn 20 provide the correct transliteration
of this (Semitic) name into Greek letters: MARIAM— vs.1 [) A], vs.11
[<strong>p</strong>66c )], vs.16 [) B], vs.18 [<strong>p</strong>66 )
B].<br />
        <strong>Matthew</strong> (13): Hebrew hy-Ntm
(<em>mattan-yah</em>: gift of Yah); the Apostle/Evangelist, also named
‘Levi of Alphaeus’ (seeLevi in Ph Notes, Mk 2:14), brother of the
Apostle Jacob of Alphaeus; Mt 10:3 etc.<br />
        <strong>Meaning</strong> (79): see Saying.<br />
        <strong>Natural</strong> (90): see Vintage.<br />
        <strong>Oracle/Prophet</strong> (31,52,88): Greek PROFHTHS =
Hebrew )ybn (<em>nabi</em>); a divine spokesperson, not merely
predictive; note that there are 24 books in the Hebrew canon of the OT,
and also 24 Prophets including John the Baptist (see <a
href="http://www.hti.umich.edu/cgi/r/rsv/rsv-idx?type=DIV1&amp;byte=3652195">IV-Ezra
14:45</a>, Rev/Ap 4:4).<br />
        <strong>Origin</strong> (18): Greek ARCH; a term from the
pre-Socratic Greek philosophers, meaning not a temporal beginning but
rather the primal source or basic substance underlying reality (thus in
Gen 1:1 [Septuagint/LXX], Mk 1:1, Jn 1:1).<br />
        <strong>Passer-by</strong> (42): Greek PARAGEIN (by-led);
transient, itinerant— see Hebrew in Ph Notes<em>.</em><br />
        <strong>Philosopher</strong> (13): Greek FILOSOFOS (fond of
wisdom); this word (coined by the pre-Socratic
Pythagoras)
has no precise Hebrew/Aramaic equivalent, and thus Matthew himself may
have used the Greek term; but see the parallel at Job 9:4, bbl Mkx
(<em>khakam liba</em>), ‘wise in heart’.<br />
        <strong>Prophet</strong> (52): see Oracle.<br />
        <strong>Rabbi</strong> (12): Hebrew ybr (my great-one) = Coptic
no2 (great, C250a); a spiritual authority; Jn 1:38, 3:26, Mt 23:7.<br />
        <strong>Recognition</strong>
(3,5,39,43,51,56,67,69a,78,80,91,105): Coptic sooun (C369b) = Greek
GNWSIS (gnosis); this important term means direct personal acquaintance
rather than mere intellectual knowledge, as in Jn 17:25 and I-Jn 4:7;
see Th 5, Ph 116,122,134, Tr 1,4,6 etc., Incarnate and Gnosticism.<br />
        <strong>Rethink</strong> (28): Greek METANOEW (be with-mind, be
wholeminded, after-mind, reconsider) = Hebrew bw# (<em>shub</em>:
return); Ps 7:12, 22:27, Mt 3:1-2, 4:17, Lk 3:2-14; the initial message
of both John the Baptist and Christ; this important term ‘metanoia’
(mindfulness) contrasts with ‘paranoia’ (beside-mind, mindlessness)— it
does not signify a mere feeling of remorse, which is METAMELOS
(with/after-sentiment).<br />
        <strong>Sabbath</strong> (27): Hebrew tb# (<em>shabat:</em>
repose); the (7th) day of rest; Ex 21:8-11, Lk 6:1-11, Tr 7, 33— see the
pericope Lk 6:4+ in Codex D (05) [Bezae]: ‘That same day, he saw someone
working on the Sabbath,¹ he said to him: Man, if indeed you understand
what you are doing, you are blest; if indeed you do not understand, you
are accursed and a transgressor of the Torah’; Nestle-Aland, Biblio.23,
textual notes (¹asyndeton).<br />
        <strong>Salome</strong> (61b): Hebrew tymwl# (<em>shlomit</em>:
peaceful); an early female Disciple (Mk 15:40-41, 16:1); Ph 59 &amp;
79!<br />
        <strong>Samaritan</strong> (60): those Hebrews not deported to
Babylon and hence lacking the later OT scriptures (I-Ki 16:24, II-Ki
17), therefore in post-Exilic times considered heretics (as in Lk
10:25-37, Jn 4:1-42).<br />
        <strong>Saying/Meaning</strong> (Prolog, 1,19,38,79): Coptic
4a`e (C612b) = Greek LOGOS = Hebrew rm) (<em>amr</em>) = Aramaic )rmym
(<em>memra</em>); English ‘meaning’ derives from Anglo-Saxon
‘mænan’ = ‘to have in mind, mention, conceive + express’, the exact
sense of both <em>logos</em> and <em>memra</em>; Jn 1:1 thus reads ‘In
(the) Origin was the Meaning’; one Greek term for ‘word’ is RHMA.<br />
        <strong>Shimon Kefa</strong> (13,114): Hebrew Nw(m# (Shimón) =
hearing (Gen 29:33); Aramaic )pyk (<em>kefa</em>) = Greek PETROS
(bedrock)— the chief Apostle, Simon Peter (Mt 10:2, 16:15-19).<br />
        <strong>Sky/Heaven</strong> (3,6,9,11,12,20,44,54,91,111,114):
Coptic pe (C259a) = Greek OURANOS = Hebrew Mym# (<em>shamayim</em>;
plural); note that ‘sky’ = ‘heaven’ in all three languages.<br />
        <strong>Spirit</strong> (14,29,44,53,60,101,114): Hebrew xwr
(<em>ruakh</em>: feminine gender!) = Greek PNEUMA (neuter gender!); in
both languages the word for ‘spirit’ is like ‘breath’ or ‘wind’ (Isa
57:16, Jn 3:5-8); see Holy Spirit.<br />
        <strong>System</strong> (21,27,56,80,110): see World .<br />
        <strong>Theologian</strong> (39): Greek GRAMMATEUS (scribe); an
expert on the scriptures; Mt 23:1-39 etc.<br />
        <strong>Thomas</strong> (Prolog, 13, Colophon): Aramaic Mw)t
(<em>taom</em>) = Greek DIDUMOS; ‘duplicate, twin’; the Apostle Thomas,
author of this text (Jn 11:16, 20:24-29, 21:2); also note that Hebrew
‘Judas’ = ‘praised’ = Arabic ‘hammad’ as in ‘Nag Hammadi’ (village
of-praise) and ‘Mohammad’ (great-praise), the Ishmaelite prophet: Gen
16-17, 21:1-21, 25:12-18, Zech 9:6-7!, plus not only the Arabic <a
href="http://etext.virginia.edu/koran.html">Qur’án</a> but also—
importantly— the 
Hadith.<br />
        <strong>Totality/Everyone/Everything/the All</strong>
(2,6,67,77): Coptic thr.3 (all/every of-him, C424a).<br />
        <strong>Transgression</strong> (14,104): Coptic nobe (C222a) =
Greek AMARTIA = Hebrew t)+x (<em>khatat</em>); a violation of the Torah,
a sin; see Torah and compare Defilement in Ph Notes.<br />
        <strong>Trees</strong> (19): the ‘five trees’ may refer to the
five senses (NB that all emotions can presumably be included in the
realm of feeling); see Tr 28 and ‘Angel and Image’; it is noteworthy
that the olive tree in particular does not shed its leaves
annually.<br />
        <strong>Vintage/Kind/Natural</strong> (47,65,90): Greek CRHSTOS
(used), Ph 126; the ancient pagans often confused this common term with
the rare CRISTOS, with reference to the Hebrew Messiah.<br />
        <strong>War</strong> (16): Greek POLEMOS; perhaps it is logical
nowadays to interpret ‘the stars falling from the sky’ (Mk 13:25, Rev/Ap
6:13 &amp; 8:6 ff.) as a nuclear war, since hydrogen bombs are literally
small man-made stars; ‘this generation’ in Mk 13:30 is presumably
counted from either May 1948 (the refounding of Israel) or June 1967
(the reconquest of Jerusalem, Lk 21:24), and could range from forty
years (Num 14:33, Dt 2:14) to one hundred years (Gen 15:13-16).<br />
        <strong>Wickedness</strong> (45): Greek PONEROS; this term
(which also occurs in the canonical Gospels at Mk 7:22-23 etc.) has a
root meaning of hard work or laborious drudgery, thus oppressive or
exploitative.<br />
        <strong>World/System</strong>
(10,16,21,24,27,28,51,56,80,110,111): Greek KOSMOS (arrangement, order)—
originally the pre-Socratic philosopher
Pythagoras
had used this term to designate the entire natural universe, as in
‘cosmos’; but in the Gospel <em>koinê</em> (later common Greek) it had
also come to signify the conventionality or artificiality of the human
social system, as in ‘cosmetic’; see Lk 2:1, 4:5-6, 12:30-31.<br />
        <strong>Yeshúa</strong> (Prolog <em>et passim</em>): Aramaic
(w#y = Hebrew (w#why (<em>Yehóshua</em>); from (#y-hwhy (<em>YHWH
ysha:</em> He-Is Savior); Josh 1:1, Ezra 5:2 (Aramaic form), Mt 1:21, Ph
20a; this name could not be accurately transcribed in Greek, which lacks
the SH sound; in the Greek and Coptic uncial manuscripts it was
invariably abbreviated IS or IHS with an overline; see also the second
commandment as written <em>exclusively</em> on synagogue tablets of the
Decalogue ): hyhy (the grammatically correct form of He Is’)!<br />
        <strong>Yoga</strong> (90): Coptic na6b (‘yoke’, C726), here
meaning a spiritual discipline (the cognate Sanskrit term ‘yoga’ conveys
this sense quite well); see Ph 79.</p>
