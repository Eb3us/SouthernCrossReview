<h1>Mother Earth</h1>

<h2>by Becky Hemsley</h2>
<p>She’s mountains and she’s sunshine<br />
She’s the moon, silvery bright<br />
She’s the clouds and wind and rain<br />
And she’s the dancing Northern Lights.</p>
<p>She is deserts and savannahs<br />
She’s the waves that fill the sea<br />
She is birdsong and she’s flowers<br />
She’s the blossom on the trees.</p>
<p>And if you treat her fairly<br />
She will let the sun shine through<br />
She will kiss you with a gentle breeze<br />
And paint the sky in blue.</p>
<p>She’ll rain if you are thirsty<br />
Then she’ll blow the clouds away<br />
And she’ll decorate with rainbows<br />
Whilst she calms the ocean waves.</p>
<p>But if you treat her badly<br />
She will breathe out stormy skies<br />
She will summon up tornadoes<br />
And antagonise the tides.</p>
<p>She’ll throw things from the mountain<br />
In an avalanche of snow<br />
And she’ll blaze and burn the forest<br />
So the trees no longer grow.</p>
<p>She’ll treat you as you treat her<br />
So be careful what you choose<br />
For she’s power you can’t comprehend<br />
And much she stands to lose.</p>
<p>So treat her with the kindness<br />
And respect that she deserves<br />
See, if you rearrange her heart<br />
You’ll see it holds the earth.</p>
