<i>Faust</i> as the "Metamorphosis of a Single Human Being"</font></font></font></b></center>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In considering Goethe as a scientist, we may naturally look at his color
theory and his essays on the metamorphoses of plants and animals. But why
not include his magnum opus, <i>Faust</i>, as the culmination of his <i>scientific</i>
writings? After all, if we extend the perspective of Goethean science,
could we not call <i>Faust</i>: "The Metamorphosis of a Single Human Being?"
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what a human being Goethe gives us! Henry Faust, a single, middle-aged
professor at a major central European University who is so bored by his
life that he conjures up the devil Mephistopheles to rescue himself from
his academic ennui and depression?
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this hitting too close to home here? If so, perhaps I should generalize
more. Might we not see the appearance of Mephistopheles to Faust as the
appearance of chaos and complexity to modern science and academia which
is equally bored with the inane intellectual ordering and gross oversimplifying
of the universe we all inhabit together?
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to present a passage from my translation of the Study
Scene&nbsp;<sup><a href="#ref1">1</A></sup><a name="retA">&nbsp;</a>in <i>Faust</i> <i>Part 1</i> where Mephistopheles first appears
to Prof. Henry Faust. Listen for the Devil’s praise of Chaos after Faust’s
initial fear subsides.

<blockquote>
<i><font face="georgia"><b>FAUST</b></font>: So, therefore,
who are you?</i>
<p><b><i><font face="georgia">MEPHISTOPHELES</font>:
</i></b><i>A party to that power that always wills the Evil, and always creates the
Good.</i>
<p><i><b>FAUST:</b> What do you mean by this enigma?</i>
<p><i><b>MEPHISTOPHELES: </b>I am the spirit that always denies. I have
the right to do so, since everything that comes into being deserves to
be annihilated. Of course, it would have been much better, had nothing
started in the first place. So therefore, everything that you call Sin,
Destruction, Evil, is my proper element.</i>
<p><i><b>FAUST: </b>You call yourself a part, and yet you stand before
me whole?</i>
<p><i><b>MEPHISTOPHELES: </b>I speak to you the humble truth. If humanity,
this insignificant world of fools takes itself to be the whole — well,
I am a part of that part that in the beginning </i>was<i> the Whole. A part of
the Darkness, Darkness that gave birth to Light. The proud Light that now
competes with Mother Night, concerning </i>her<i> more ancient rank and place.</i>
<p><i><b>FAUST</b>: Now I know your worthy duties. You cannot wreak destruction
on any grand scale, so you focus on the insignificant.</i>
<p><i><b>MEPHISTOPHELES: </b>Freely, I admit it, I have hardly done a thing—
If you compare this idiotic world of "Somethingness" with that other world
of "Nothingness!" I had not realized how nearly futile were my efforts!
I sent tidal waves and storms and earthquakes, holocausts — when all was
done, the sea and land remained as quiet as before. And as for that accursed
trash, that progeny of animals and men, there is absolutely nothing I can
do with them! How many of them have I so far buried in the earth! Yet fresh
new blood is always circulating! On and on it goes! I should be driven
mad! Seeds by the thousands, bursting forth from Air, from Water, even
Earth, Dry! Moist! Warm! Cold! If I had not reserved the element of Fire
for myself, I would not have a thing to call my own.</i>
<p><i><b>FAUST: </b>So you set yourself against eternal action. Yes, against
the healing power of creation! How spitefully you clench your frozen Devil's
fist against it all— in vain! You marvelous Son of Chaos, look for something
new to do!&nbsp;</i><sup><a href="#ref2">2</A></sup> <a name="retB">&nbsp;</a>

not defined as the absence of light but rather the MOTHER of Light, i.e.
<i>Mother Night</i>, more primeval and more real that Light itself!! May I now formally
rename Mother Night, Mother Chaos! We shall mention her again— along with
her sometime lover, Father Time.

<p><b><font face="georgia"><font size=+1>Part I</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="georgia"><font color="#990000"><font size=+1>The Epistemology
of Goethean Science</font></font></font></b></center>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before jumping from Goethe to present day chaos studies, let me first
acknowledge the pioneer in the field of establishing Goethe’s scientific
epistemology. In the early 1880’s, a young science student at the <i>technische
Holchschule</i> in Vienna was invited to edit Goethe’s scientific writings
for Kuerschner’s monumental publication of German literature with special
focus on Goethe’s works. The young scholar was Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925)
an Austrian by birth who became one of the minor figures of German Idealist
philosophy of the late 19<sup>th</sup> Century.
<p>As a philosopher, Steiner took dead aim on the fallacy of Kant’s dogmatic
belief in the complete subjectivity of human sense perception. Steiner
saw in Goethe someone who had never fallen into the epistemological trap
of Kant’s essential canonization of Rene Descartes as the patron saint
of subjectivism.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steiner saw that Goethe made a clear distinction between the inorganic
sciences and the organic sciences. In a book published in 1886, <i>Grundlinien
einer Erkenntnistheorie der Goetheschen Weltanschauung</i> (English title<i>:
A Theory of Knowledge Implicit in Goethe’s World Conception</i>) Rudolf
Steiner, in 1886 mind you, clears the epistemological decks for a science
of organics which I believe is now ready to apprehend directly chaos and
complexity by training human intuition as a scientific mode of cognition.
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The sense world as inorganic does not arrive at individuality. Only
in its totality is it complete in itself. We must strive therefore, if
we would have a whole [for the inorganic world] to conceive of the assemblage
of the inorganic as a system. Such a system is the cosmos [or universe]."
A thorough understanding of the cosmos is the goal and ideal of inorganic
natural science. Every scientific endeavor which does not attain to this
is merely preparatory: a part of the whole, but not the whole itself.&nbsp;<sup><a href="#ref3">3</A></sup> <a name="retC">&nbsp;</a>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, for Steiner, organic science must take as its <i>starting</i>
point the <i>endpoint</i> of the inorganic, which is the absolute completeness
or wholeness of the entire cosmos, the wholeness of the entire universe—
as its <i>point of departure!</i>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Therefore a science of organics that sets out to be scientific in
the sense that physics or mechanics is scientific must show the Type as
the most universal form. Just as we trace a phenomenon in the inorganic
to a natural law, here in the organic we evolve a specific form from the
primal or archetypal form.&nbsp;<sup><a href="#ref4">4</A></sup> <a name="retD">&nbsp;</a>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"An organics is possible which will be scientific in the strictest sense
just as mechanics is scientific. Only the method is different. The method
of mechanics is that of proof. But through this method of proof, however,
we can make no headway in the science of the organic. The type does not
require that under certain conditions a definite phenomenon occur; the
type does not fix anything in regard to a relationship of elements mutually
alien which confront each other. The type determines only the conformity
to law of its own <i>parts</i>. It does not point beyond itself like a
natural law does.&nbsp;<sup><a href="#ref5">5</A></sup> <a name="retE">&nbsp;</a>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here the evolutionary method must replace the method of proof. Here
it is not to be established that the external conditions act upon one another
in this way and for that reason bring about a definite result, but that
a special form has been developed under definite external conditions out
of the type. This is the radical difference between inorganic and organic
science. This distinction is not made basic in any other method of research
so consistently as in Goethe’s. No one else recognized as Goethe did, that
an organics must be possible apart from all vague mysticism, without teleology,
without the assumption of special creative thoughts."&nbsp;<sup><a href="#ref6">6</A></sup> <a name="retF">&nbsp;</a>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goethe stated: "One should not see anything further behind the phenomena:
they themselves <i>are</i> the theory."&nbsp;<sup><a href="#ref7">7</A></sup><a name="retG">&nbsp;</a>Thus to Goethe, there was no separation
between the <i>form</i> of a theory and the <i>content</i> of that theory.
As Steiner puts it:
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"the [organic] type does not determine the content in a merely formal
way as does the [inorganic] law… The task which is required of our mind
is to participate productively in creating the content while dealing with
the formal. A mode of thinking in which the form and content appear in
direct connection has always been called <i>intuitive</i>."&nbsp;<sup><a href="#ref8">8</A></sup> <a name="retH">&nbsp;</a>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"…the mind must work with far greater intensity in apprehending the
[organic] type than in grasping the [inorganic] natural law. [The mind]
must create the content with the form. The mind must take upon itself an
activity which is the function of the senses in inorganic science and which
we call "Anschauung" (perception). The mind itself therefore must be perceptive
on this higher plane. Our power of judgment. ‘anschauende Urteilskraft’,
must perceive in thinking and think in perceiving.&nbsp;<sup><a href="#ref9">9</A></sup> <a name="retI">&nbsp;</a>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As the type in organic nature replaces natural law in the inorganic,
so intuition replaces the power of judgment through proof.&nbsp;<sup><a href="#ref10">10</A></sup> <a name="retJ">&nbsp;</a>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every single organism is the molding of the type in a special form.
It is an individuality which governs and determines itself from a center
outward. It is a totality complete in itself— which in inorganic nature
is true of the cosmos alone.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ideal of inorganic science is to grasp the totality of all phenomena
as a unitary system in order that we may approach each phenomenon with
the consciousness that we recognize it as a member [or part] of the universe.
In the organic science on the contrary, the ideal must be to have in the
utmost entirety possible in the type and its phenomenal forms, that which
we see evolving in the series of single beings. Tracing the type back through
all phenomena is here that which matters. In inorganic science the system
exists; in organic science the comparison of each single form with the
type.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spectral analysis and the perfecting of astronomy extend to the universe
the truths attained on the limited sphere of earth. Hereby these [inorganic]
sciences approach the first ideal. The second will be fulfilled when the
comparative method applied by Goethe is recognized in it full scope."&nbsp;<sup><a href="#ref11">11</A></sup> <a name="retK">&nbsp;</a>

<p><b><font face="georgia"><font color="#990000"><font size=+1>Bringing
Chaos to Order</font></font></font></b>
</center>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I now proceed to light this candle
in front of the lectern, let us move two centuries from Goethe and one century from Steiner
to arrive at contemporary chaos and complexity studies. But first, I need
to focus on chaos the way a physical scientist or mathematician would.
What is chaos to a mathematician? It is a non-linear equation with small
terms that iterate, or loop back or feedback into the main equation. Non-linear
equations are equations of interconnectedness, or of coupling where one
small term may feed back over and over again and plunge the solution either
into chaotic instability from positive feedback or else into well-ordered
stability from negative feedback.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is chaos to a physicist? Exactly one century ago, Henri Poincare
discovered inherent <i>mathematical</i> chaos when he tried to solve Newton’s
equations of celestial mechanics for more than two bodies! You see, with
just two isolated bodies like earth and moon and no other influences, the
equations are solved perfectly and for all time. But just introduce a 3<sup>rd</sup>
body, let alone 4<sup>th</sup>, 5<sup>th</sup> or more and the equations cannot be
solved because of the reciprocal influences of each body on all the others.
Their behavior can only be <i>approximated</i> by what is called "perturbation
theory." But Poincare found that even a tiny, tiny perturbation, like the
now proverbial butterfly’s wing flapping in Hong Kong, could actually feed
back into the whole system, amplify and actually knock a planet out of
its orbit.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can we bring chaos to order or are we just stuck teetering on the edge
of Occam’s Razor&nbsp;<sup><a href="#ref12">12</A></sup><a name="retL">&nbsp;&nbsp;</a>because we subconsciously harbor such a phobia against
chaos and complexity? Why are we so afraid to make that epistemological
leap from passive <i>approximation</i> of reality to active intuitive <i>perception</i>
of reality? If we don’t make that leap of intuition, then all science beyond
the inorganic will remain a reductionistic rubble of useless information—
except for technological progress. I’m not knocking technology; but technology
will answer no questions beyond the closed system its own self-consistent
and therefore self-satisfied inorganic realm.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the first step beyond the inorganic realm is to realize that
the cosmos beyond the inorganic is <i>incalculable</i>. The mathematician
Kurt Goedel proved in 1931 that any mathematical system is incomplete for
a description of reality. That incompleteness is built into every computer
because every computer, now matter how big, must approximate the numbers
it crunches. And by so doing, it lops off a tiny piece that might just
feed back into the system and drive it to chaos, unpredictable chaos, yet
such a chaos that can equally and inevitably spontaneously self-organize
into a stable orderly system again.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notice the word I emphasize: <i>approximate. </i>We live in an approximate
universe, don’t we? We don’t figure things exactly; we approximate. We
round off. We truncate. We have to. Otherwise, we could never complete
a single calculation and without completing calculations, how could we
have brought about the tremendous order we have in this our corner of the
universe? But what kind of order is this calculable universe we have created?
According to Rudolf Steiner, it’s the <i>inorganic </i>universe, the one
that keeps on expanding outward and outward until it finally encompasses
the entire universe itself in a Grand Unification. Yet even beyond that
unification there, he says, at that infinite periphery, we take our point
of departure for the science of organics that Goethe pioneered.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is a figure living today who might be called a mythical son
of Mother Chaos and Father Time, it is the 82 year old Nobel laureate in
chemistry, Ilya Prigogine, at the University of Texas at Austin. Ilya looks
more like his father, because he speaks of the irreversibility of time,
the idea that time cannot be reversed; "time’s arrow" can only fly in one
direction: forward. Why? Because everything orderly in the universe, including
the order of the universe itself, i.e. cosmos, is born out of chaos, chaos
that can never be reproduced — except in some approximate calculation.
But isn’t that what we call memory or history? Everything in the universe
is so interconnected in its past and in its present that the future is
open to all possibilities and the past cannot be recreated, except in memory
because memory is, well, a reversible approximation to an irreversible
universe.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prigogine shows how chemical
systems far from equilibrium can create order spontaneously and then, such
order can dissipate again into chaos. What we call order is a balance
between two extremes of chaos, a creative chaos and a destructive chaos.
If you look at the candle flame here, notice that the rather orderly flame is suspended between
a chemical chaos of wax igniting wick below and an swirling chaos of heated air rising above. The
point is that chaos enfolds order and order in turn enfolds chaos again.
Thus complexity can hide simplicity, but that same simplicity can harbor
a deeper chaos. Occam's Razor is not only double-edged, it may shatter
to bits if we don’t balance properly on its edge.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another living, mythical son of Mother Chaos and Father Time,
a physicist who also works in Austin, Texas. He takes more after his "mother."
Hal Puthoff at the Institute for Advanced Studies (IAS) in Austin is completing
the work of the late Russian physicist Andrei Sakarhov in the field of
quantum physics called "Zero-Point Energy." What is ZPE? It is the energy
of the vacuum, the <i>infinite</i> energy of the vacuum, as predicted by
early quantum physics and experimentally verified today. But isn't the
vacuum supposed to be empty? Void of energy? Zero energy to be exact? Well,
in the approximate fictional inorganic universe, it is, but in the exact
intuitive organic universe, the vacuum is anything but empty. In fact,
the vacuum is the source of all creative chaos, some of which spontaneously
ordered the universe we inhabit even to the point that we, like Faust,
become bored with and depressed by it.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you feeling uncertain about all of this? Well, perhaps you should
be. Is the glass of water half empty or half full? For one person's uncertainty
is another person's freedom. And it is directly due to Heisenberg's Uncertainty
Principle that ZPE has been recognized. Yet, despite all that uncertainty
and unpredictability, don’t we all live in a certain, predictable deterministic
universe? I believe we all do. The question is: who does the determining?

<p><b><font face="georgia"><font color="#CC0000"><font size=+1>Looking
Phenomena Right in the I</font></font></font></b></center>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who am I anyway? I mean, how far out do I extend? Am I really bounded
by this limited body I seem to inhabit? All around me, outside of me seem
to exist objects and beings who are not I. Myself the rest of the universe.
Inner, intensive Subject—outer, extensive Object. Forever cut off from
each other? Yet if we are all part of this inorganic "Grand Unification"
scheme that leads us out to the ends of the universe — only to take an
intuitive leap to organic wholeness and incalculable completeness — might
we then not then conclude that whatever constitutes my self, my I, my ego
and your self, your I, your ego, is out there, too? Is this pure solipsism
on the road to megalomania or are we simply anthropomorphizing the universe?
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Admittedly and undoubtedly, the Cartesian/Kantian dualism that defines
the epistemology of modern Western science degenerates into solipsism whenever
it attempts to answer "ultimate questions" such as: "Who am I?" or "Where
do we all come from?" The big problem with such questions is the explicit
self-reference which contradicts the mutually exclusive logic of the rigid
dualism. In fact, I might characterize such logic as the logic of NON-self
reference precisely because it "excludes the middle," which is the self-reference
to the human thinker who created the dualism in the first place!
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In science, any biological theory of evolution or astrophysical cosmogony
<i>implicitly</i> asks such self-referential questions. Solipsism then arises if the paradox
of self-reference is either ignored or denied. Science then operates under
a "don’t ask; don’t tell" policy with regard to these questions but the
price of denial is that science in its solemn solipsism ends up subjectively
anthropomorphizing the entire universe — a phenomenon I call "post-modern
scientific animism."
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goethe did not fall into this trap for the simple reason that he saw
no reason to build it in the first place. Goethe realized the scientific
experiment itself as the mediator or fulcrum balancing Subject and Object,
thus giving equal ontological status to both the subjective and the objective.
His insight prefigured the observer-created reality of quantum physics
by more than a century, albeit even quantum physics itself is still trapped
by and large in the same Cartesian "cage" that still keeps other sciences
today in epistemological captivity.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goethe avoided this problem by looking into the phenomena directly,
without the "animism" of projecting analogous phenomena which <i>ipso facto</i>
were not directly perceptible to the scientist. E.g. Goethe would reject
both the wave and the particle aspects of light because such phenomena
are conceptually inferred and not directly perceived by unaided human senses.
Goethe saw the Aristotelian "immanence" in the object because for him the
object included the subject. Therefore, he rejected the object’s Platonic
"transcendence," which demands not only the mutual exclusion of object
from subject, but also leaves the subject no choice but to anthropomorphize
the object.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But maybe this anthropomorphizing is not a bad thing. Is there anything
in the Platonic/Cartesian dualism that we can and ought to anthropomorphize
— because it points to the most human part of us? How about the very activity
we engage in to anthropomorphize <i>anything</i>? How about the activity
of human thinking itself, expressed in our subjective-objective world by
the phenomenon of light — the one "object" which we may look right in the
"I" and have it look right back at us? If a photon is an idealized, inferred
Platonic object, then is not the activity of "seeing the light," or "photonizing"
by the Platonic subject the very anthropomorphic activity of idealizing
and inferring the photon in the first place? Subject and Object may be
forever separate in their Platonic transcendence, but they are two sides
of the same coin to be spent in the Aristotelian realm of Goethe’s pure
phenomenology.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the field of optics, Fermat’s Principle states that light travels
between two points in the quickest time possible. Max Planck said this
about light:
<blockquote><i>"Thus the photons which constitute a ray of light behave
like intelligent human beings: out of all possible curves, they always
select the one which will take them most quickly to their goal."&nbsp;<sup><a href="#ref13">13</A></sup><a name="retM">&nbsp;</a></i>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is called the principle of "least action." And another alias for
the photon is: "quantum of action." Now let me quote Goethe:
<blockquote><i>"The eye was made by the light, for the light, so that
the inner light may emerge to meet the outer light."&nbsp;<sup><a href="#ref14">14</A></sup> <a name="retN">&nbsp;</a></i>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at these human attributes projected on to light: it behaves intelligently;
it has a definite purpose; it makes choices; it even creates the eyeball
itself. Yes, this is solipsism, this Platonic anthropomorphizing of light?
But I believe we are forced to do so only because of the Cartesian/Kantian
dualism which underlies our <i>inorganic</i> conception of the universe.
And that, according to Steiner, is the great value of the dualistic thinking.
It gets us off our localized terrestrial duffs and out there into the wide
open universal frontier of the entire Cosmos!
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, what if we were to stop being so miserly and give back to that objective
world the "I" that we hoard so deeply within our subjective Kantian fortress?
What if we were to lend some of that subjectivity to the phenomena of that
external world so that they might "observe" us humans as the "Selbst an
sich" (Self-in-itself) just as Kant observed the object as "Ding an sich"
("Thing in itself"). A Goethean science would then balance these two polarities
according to the title of Goethe’s essay: "The Experiment as Mediator between
Subject and Object."
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as we anthropomorphize light into an object, so does light itself
enlighten us as subjects— at least as far as we think. The key, to me,
is expressed in Goethe’s dying words: "More light!"&nbsp;<sup><a href="#ref15">15</A></sup> <a name="retO">&nbsp;</a>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like this candle flame, I am standing in the midst of order, but I am
also standing on what I used to believe was a totally empty and void vacuum.
Instead, quantum physics tells me about the infinite energy and potentiality
of this teeming vacuum of chaos— below me.
<blockquote><i>"Darkness that gave birth to light; the proud light that
now competes with Mother night concerning her more ancient rank and place."&nbsp;<sup><a href="#ref16">16</A></sup><a name="retP">&nbsp;</a></i>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above me is this vast, mostly orderly, I hope, spatial universe that
came into existence out of that primeval chaos. But it and I could plunge
into chaos at any time. I am truly standing on the edge of Occam's Razor
and it is precarious, indeed. And if there is a simple explanation for
it, then complex chaos lurks on either side of that simplicity and order.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ZPE tells me that emptiness is not a constituent of the vacuum, so
might emptiness then be the constituent factor of my own subjective mind,
my mental processes? Following Descartes, we closed ourselves off from
that teeming fullness of the vacuum and created a little island of orderly
emptiness we could call our own: "I think; therefore I am." It is my subjective
mind that is the vacuum, not the objective universe. But in order to survive,
my subjective mind had to shut down against that objective chaos "out"
there and "under" here and "over" there, so that I could recognize some
stable and orderly semblance of myself "in" here. I made myself internal
to the external world. But only because I used that approximating mind—
useful for this inorganic universe— to get stabilized and orderly "in"
here. But couldn't I equally now overcome that duality? Especially since
I created it in the first place with my thinking? Can't I uncreate it?
Can't I share some of that miserly self I've hoarded in here, within this
empty subjective mind for so long, share it with the universe, the external
world I so egotistically abandoned in following Descartes and Kant?
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or might I trust myself, not as a mere reflective thinker of empty finite
approximate thoughts <i>about</i> the universe, but as a conscious active
participant <i>immanent</i> <i>in</i> the very process of everything that
is happening now, has ever happened in the irreversible past and will happen
in the open-ended and uncertain future? A co-worker with all my fellow
human beings in the ever evolving process of that universe "out there"
yet equally "in here?" Fractal complexity tells me that reality is independent
of scale. Self-similarity at the microscopic level; self-similarity at
the macroscopic level. The ancient Hermetic saying: "As above; so below!"
How true today with fractal chaos! But also equally true: "As out there
in the objective universe, so in here in my subjective I."
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We’ve heard it said that we human beings are all "drops in the Ocean
of God." But Goethe, Steiner, Prigogine, et al. remind us of the converse
truth as well: The Ocean of God exists equally in every drop, in every
last drop of us.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here are the last 4 lines of Goethe’s <i>Faust</i>, part 2, the Mystical
Chorus singing:
<center>
<p><i><font size=+1>Alles vergaengliche ist nur ein Gleichnis.</font></i><font size=+1></font>
<br><i><font size=+1>Das Unzulaengliche, wird hier’s Ereignis</font></i><font size=+1></font>
<br><i><font size=+1>Das Unbeschreibliche, hier ist’s getan</font></i><font size=+1></font>
<br><i><font size=+1>Das ewig-weibliche, zieht uns hinan.</font></i>&nbsp;<sup><a href="#ref17">17</A></sup><a name="retQ">&nbsp;</a></center>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please excuse the liberties I take with this translation, which I make
as a kind of anthem to intuition as it begins to grasp the wholeness of
the universe.
<center>
<br><i><font size=+1>Everything past is but a metaphor!</font></i><font size=+1></font>
<br><i><font size=+1>What cannot be calculated is happening right here!</font></i><font size=+1></font>
<br><i><font size=+1>What cannot be described is being accomplished right
here!</font></i><font size=+1></font>
<br><i><font size=+1>The Eternal Feminine (Mother Chaos, Mother Night) evolves
us ever more and ever more.</font></i>&nbsp;<sup><a href="#ref18">18</A></sup><a name="retR">&nbsp;</a></center>

<P><A HREF="#retA"><sup>1</sup></A><a name="ref1">&nbsp </a> My translation of the Study Scene is part of my own one-act stage play adaptation in which I have translated a few scenes of Faust Part 1 and then tied them together by writing monologues in the
character of Mephistopheles. I have tried to be as literal as possible in my direct translation of Goethe's German text, but simultaneously had to tune my playwright's ear to the more naturalistic speech patterns and rhythms of modern American stage
actors. Furthermore, the play itself makes Mephisto more central than Faust as a character. Hence the more expository and naturalistic tone of my translation of Mephisto's lines. In short, Mephisto's imitation of a human being becomes just as good as
Faust's actual status as a human being -- a device which shames and taunts Faust much more intensely in my one act play than of course occurs in Goethe's entire opus.

<P><A HREF="#retL"><sup>12</sup><a name="ref12">&nbsp;</a> Occam's (or Ockham's) Razor, a heuristic principle of modern scientific epistemology first attributed to Nominalist theologian William of Occam (1284-1349), student of Duns Scotus and a veritable
pioneer of Kantian epistemology 400 years before Kant. William felt that the positing of objective universals beyond the subjectivity of human perception was an exercise in multiplying unnecessary and thus unprovable metaphysical entities. One of his
statements: "Frustra fit per plura quod potest fieri per pauciora." (tr. "It is vain to do with more what can be done with less.") has been appropriated by modern science to mean that if 2 scientific theories compete to explain the same phenomenon, then
the simpler one is to be chosen, because it will inevitably contain less unprovable "metaphysical baggage" than the more complicated one. Occam's Razor has also been called the "law of parsimony" in that it strives to reduce phenomena down to their simpl
est
parts. For that reason, staunch scientific reductionists enshrine the principle as a law, while more holistically inclined phenomenalists recognize that Nature is often times more objectively complex than our subjective oversimplifications of that reality
