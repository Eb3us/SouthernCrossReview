## Brown Girl Creed

I believe in my mother, the mother almighty, \
mover of heaven and earth, \
creator of daughters and dinner, \
all that is always unseen, 

I believe in my mother, daughter of Dr. and Mrs. Pulmano, \
who dreamed an American dream, \
who suffered barely making ends meet, \
who suffered giving everything unto everyone, \
who suffered, died, and was buried; \
she descended into this American earth, \
while wailing women recited novena, \
she ascended into heaven, \
and is seated somewhere comfortable now, \
she's watching the Niners game now, \
she's wearing her Jerry Rice jersey, \
she's got a Diet Pepsi and a plate of Panda Express, \
she's watching reruns of *Murder She Wrote* and *Matlock *\
if the game isn't going the way she'd like,    

I believe in my mother, in the most sacred of sisterhoods, \
in kapwa with the kumares, the forgiveness of fear, \
her transcendence from a tumorous body, \
her pink jasmines and rose bushes in bloom. Amen.
