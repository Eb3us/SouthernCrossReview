# The Path to a Livable Future

### Or Will Rich Corporations Trash the Planet?

## By [Noam Chomsky](https://tomdispatch.com/authors/noamchomsky/) and
[Stan Cox](https://tomdispatch.com/authors/stan-cox/)

*This month will mark a critical juncture in the struggle to avoid
climate catastrophe. At the COP26 global climate summit kicking off next
week in Glasgow, Scotland, negotiators will be faced with the urgent
need to get the world economy off the business-as-usual track that will
take the Earth up to and beyond *[*3 degrees
Celsius*](https://www.ipcc.ch/assessment-report/ar6/)* of excess heating
before this century's end, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC). Yet so far, the pledges of rich nations to cut
greenhouse-gas emissions have been far too weak to rein in the
temperature rise. Meanwhile, the Biden administration's climate plans
*[*hang in the
balance*](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/10/climate/climate-action-congress.html?searchResultPosition=1)*.
If Congress fails to pass the reconciliation bill, the next opportunity
for the United States to take effective climate action may not arise
until it's too late.   *

*For the past several decades, Noam Chomsky has been one of the most
forceful and persuasive voices confronting injustice, inequity, and the
threat posed by human-caused climate chaos to civilization and the
Earth. I was eager to know Professor Chomsky's views on the roots of our
current dire predicament and on humanity's prospects for emerging from
this crisis into a livable future. He very graciously agreed to speak
with me by way of a video chat. The text here is an abridged version of
a conversation we had on October 1, 2021.*

[]{#anchor}*Professor Chomsky, now 92, is the author of numerous
best-selling political works, translated into scores of languages. His
critiques of power and advocacy on behalf of the political agency of the
common person have inspired generations of activists and organizers. He
has been institute professor emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology since 1976. His most recent books are *[Consequences of

Planet](https://www.versobooks.com/books/3239-climate-crisis-and-the-global-green-new-deal),*
with Robert Pollin and C.J. Polychroniou.*

*Stan Cox: Most of the nations that will be meeting in Glasgow for the
*[*26th UN Climate Change Conference*](https://ukcop26.org/)* on October
31-November 12, 2021, have made emissions-reduction pledges. For the
most part, those pledges are wholly inadequate. What principles do you
think should guide the effort to prevent climate catastrophe?*

Noam Chomsky: The initiators of the Paris Agreement intended to have a
binding treaty, not voluntary agreements, but there was an impediment.
It's called the Republican Party. It was clear that the Republican Party
would never accept any binding commitments. The Republican organization,
which has lost any pretense of being a normal political party, is almost
solely dedicated to the welfare of the super-rich and the corporate
sector, and cares absolutely nothing about the population or the future
of the world. The Republican organization would never have accepted a
treaty. In response, the organizers reduced their goal to a voluntary
agreement, which has all the difficulties that you mentioned.

We've lost six years, four under the Trump administration which was
openly dedicated to maximizing the use of fossil fuels and dismantling
the regulatory apparatus that, to some extent, had limited their lethal
effects.  To some extent, these regulations protected sectors of the
population from pollution, mostly the poor and people of color. But
they're the ones who, of course, face the main burden of pollution. It's
the poor people of the world who live in what Trump called "shithole
countries" that suffer the most; they have contributed the least to the
disaster, and they suffer the worst.

It doesn't have to be this way. As you write in your new book, [*The
Path to a Liveable
Future*](https://citylights.com/city-lights-published/path-to-a-livable-future/),
there is indeed a path to a livable future. There are ways to have
responsible, sane, and racially just policies. It's up to all of us to
demand them, something young people around the world are already doing.

Other countries have their own things to answer for, but the United
States has one of the worst records in the world. The United States
blocked the Paris Agreement before Trump eventually got into office. But
it was under Trump's instructions that the United States pulled out of
the agreement altogether.

If you look over at the more sane Democrats, who are far from guiltless,
there are people called moderates like Senator Joe Manchin

the leading recipient of fossil-fuel funding, whose position is that of
the fossil-fuel companies, which is, as he put it, no elimination, just
innovation. That's Exxon Mobil's view, too: "Don't worry, we'll take
care of you," they say. "We're a soulful corporation. We're investing in
some futuristic ways to remove from the atmosphere the pollution that
we're pouring into it. Everything's fine, just trust us." No
elimination, just innovation, which may or may not come and if it does,
it will probably be too late and too limited.

Take the [IPCC report](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/) that just
appeared. It was much more dire than previous ones and said we must
eliminate fossil fuels step by step, every year, and be free of them
completely within a few decades. A few days after the report was
released, Joe Biden issued a plea to the OPEC oil cartel to increase
production, which would lower gas prices in the United States and
improve his position with the population. There was immediate euphoria
in the petroleum journals. There's lots of profit to be made, but at
what expense? It was nice to have the human species for a couple of
hundred thousand years, but evidently that's long enough. After all, the
average lifespan of a species on Earth is apparently around 100,000
years. So why should we break the record? Why organize for a just future
for all when we can trash the planet helping rich corporations get
richer?

*SC: Ecological catastrophe is closing in on us largely because, as you
once put it, "the entire socioeconomic system is based on production for
profit and a growth imperative that cannot be sustained." However, it
seems that only state authority can implement the necessary changes in
ways that are equitable, fair, and just. * *Given the emergency we face,
do you think that the U.S. government would be able to justify imposing
national-resource constraints like rules for resource allocation or
fair-shares rationing, policies that would necessarily limit the freedom
of local communities and individuals in their material lives?*

NC: Well, we have to face some realities. I would like to see a move
towards a more free and just society --- production for need rather than
production for profit, working people able to control their own lives
instead of subordinating themselves to masters for almost their entire
waking life. The time required for succeeding at such efforts is simply
too great for addressing this crisis. That means we need to solve this
within the framework of existing institutions, which can be ameliorated.

The economic system of the last 40 years has been particularly
destructive. It's inflicted a major assault on most of the population,
resulting in a huge growth in inequality and attacks on democracy and
the environment.

A livable future is possible. We don't have to live in a system in which
the tax rules have been changed so that billionaires pay lower rates
than working people. We don't have to live in a form of state capitalism
in which the lower 90% of income earners have been robbed of
approximately \$50 trillion, for the benefit of a fraction of 1%. That's
the estimate of the RAND Corporation, a serious underestimate if we look
at other devices that have been used. There are ways of reforming the
existing system within basically the same framework of institutions. I
think they ought to change, but it would have to be over a longer
timescale.

The question is: Can we prevent climate catastrophe within the framework
of less savage state capitalist institutions? I think there's a reason
to believe that we can, and there are very careful, detailed proposals
as to how to do it, including ones in your new book, as well as the
proposals of my friend and co-author, economist Robert Pollin, who's
worked many of these things out in great detail. Jeffrey Sachs, another
fine economist, using somewhat different models, has come to pretty much
the same conclusions. These are pretty much along lines of proposals of
the International Energy Association, by no means a radical
organization, one that grew out of the energy corporations. But they all
have essentially the same picture.

There's, in fact, even a [congressional
resolution](https://www.congress.gov/116/bills/hres109/BILLS-116hres109ih.pdf)
by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ed Markey which outlines proposals that
are pretty close to this. And I think it's all within the range of
feasibility. Their cost estimates of 2% to 3% of GDP, with feasible
efforts, would not only address the crisis, but would create a more
livable future, one without pollution, without traffic jams, and with
more constructive, productive work, better jobs. All of this is
possible.

But there are serious barriers --- the fossil-fuel industries, the
banks, the other major institutions, which are designed to maximize
profit and not care about anything else. After all, that was the
announced slogan of the neoliberal period --- the economic guru Milton
Friedman's pronouncement that corporations have no responsibility to the
public or to the workforce, that their total responsibility is to
maximize profit for the few.

For public-relations reasons, fossil-fuel corporations like ExxonMobil
often portray themselves as soulful and benevolent, working day and
night for the benefit of the common good.  It's called greenwashing.

SC: *Some of the most widely discussed methods for capturing and
removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere would consume vast
quantities of biomass produced on hundreds of millions or billions of
acres, thereby threatening ecosystems and food production, largely in
low-income, low-emissions nations.  A group of ethicists and other
scholars recently wrote that a "core principle" of climate justice is
that "the urgent, basic needs of poor people and poor countries ought to
be secured against the effects of climate change and of measures taken
to limit" climate change. That would seem to clearly rule out these
"emit carbon now, capture it later" plans, and there are other examples
of what we might call "climate-mitigation imperialism." Do you think
that the world may be faced with more and more of this sort of
exploitation as temperatures rise? And what do you think about these
proposals for bioenergy and carbon capture?*

NC: It's totally immoral, but it's standard practice. Where does waste
go? It doesn't go in your backyard, it goes to places like Somalia that
can't protect themselves. The European Union, for example, has been
dumping its atomic wastes and other pollution off the coast of Somalia,
harming the fishing areas and local industries. It's horrendous.

The latest IPCC report calls for an end to fossil fuels. The hope is
that we can avert the worst and reach a sustainable economy within a
couple of decades. If we don't do that, we will reach irreversible
tipping points and the people most vulnerable --- those least
responsible for the crisis --- will suffer first and most severely from
the consequences. People living in the plains of Bangladesh, for
example, where powerful cyclones cause extraordinary damage. People
living in India, where the temperature can go over 120 degrees
Fahrenheit in summer.  Many may witness parts of the world becoming
unlivable.

There were recent reports by Israeli geoscientists condemning its
government for not taking account of the effect of the policies they are
pursuing, including developing new gas fields in the Mediterranean. They
developed an analysis that indicated that, within a couple of decades,
over the summer, the Mediterranean would be reaching the heat of a
Jacuzzi, and the low-lying plains would be inundated. People would still
live in Jerusalem and Ramallah, but flooding would impact much of the
population. Why not change course to prevent this?

SC: *The neoclassical economics underlying these injustices lives on in
economic climate models known as "integrated assessment models," which
come down to cost-benefit analyses based on the so-called social cost of
carbon. With these projections, are economists seeking to gamble away
the right of future generations to a decent life?*

NC: We have no right to gamble with the lives of the people in South
Asia, in Africa, or people in vulnerable communities in the United
States. You want to do analyses like that in your academic seminar? OK,
go ahead. But don't dare translate it into policy. Don't dare to do
that.

There's a striking difference between physicists and economists.
Physicists don't say, hey, let's try an experiment that might destroy
the world, because it would be interesting to see what would happen. But
economists do that. On the basis of neoclassical theories, they
instituted a major revolution in world affairs in the early 1980s that
took off with Carter, and accelerated with Reagan and Thatcher. Given
the power of the United States compared with the rest of the world, the
neoliberal assault, a major experiment in economic theory, had a
devastating result. It didn't take a genius to figure it out. Their
motto has been, "Government is the problem."

That doesn't mean you eliminate decisions; it just means you transfer
them. Decisions still have to be made. If they're not made by
government, which is, in a limited way, under popular influence, they
will be made by concentrations of private power, which have no
accountability to the public. And following the Friedman instructions,
have no responsibility to the society that gave them the gift of
incorporation. They have only the imperative of self-enrichment.

Margaret Thatcher then comes along and says there is no such thing as
society, just atomized individuals who are somehow managing in the
market. Of course, there is a small footnote that she didn't bother to
add: for the rich and powerful, there is plenty of society.
Organizations like the Chamber of Commerce, the Business Roundtable,
ALEC, all kinds of others. They get together, they defend themselves,
and so on. There is plenty of society for them, just not for the rest of
us. Most people have to face the ravages of the market. And, of course,
the rich don't. Corporations count on a powerful state to bail them out
every time there's some trouble.  The rich have to have the powerful
state --- as well as its police powers --- to be sure nobody gets in
their way.

*SC:* *Where do you see hope?*

NC: Young people. In September, there was an international climate
strike; hundreds of thousands of young people came out to demand an end
to environmental destruction. Greta Thunberg recently stood up at the
Davos meeting of the great and powerful and gave them a sober talk on
what they're doing. "How dare you," she said, "You have stolen my dreams
and my childhood with your empty words." You have betrayed us. Those are
words that should be seared into everyone's consciousness, particularly
people of my generation who have betrayed them and continue to betray
the youth of the world and the countries of the world.

We now have a struggle. It can be won, but the longer it's delayed, the
more difficult it'll be. If we'd come to terms with this ten years ago,
the cost would have been much less. If the U.S. hadn't been the only
country to refuse the Kyoto Protocol, it would have been much easier.
Well, the longer we wait, the more we'll betray our children and our
grandchildren. Those are the choices. I don't have many years; others of
you do. The possibility for a just and sustainable future exists, and
there's plenty that we can do to get there before it's too late.
