# Murder Most Foul

## by Bob Dylan

Twas a dark day in Dallas, November \'63\
A day that will live on in infamy\
President Kennedy was a-ridin\' high\
Good day to be livin\' and a good day to die\
Being led to the slaughter like a sacrificial lamb\
He said, \"Wait a minute, boys, you know who I am?\"\
\"Of course we do, we know who you are\"\
Then they blew off his head while he was still in the car\
Shot down like a dog in broad daylight\
Was a matter of timing and the timing was right\
You got unpaid debts, we\'ve come to collect\
We\'re gonna kill you with hatred, without any respect\
We\'ll mock you and shock you and we\'ll put it in your face\
We\'ve already got someone here to take your place\
The day they blew out the brains of the king\
Thousands were watchin\', no one saw a thing\
It happened so quickly, so quick, by surprise\
Right there in front of everyone\'s eyes\
Greatest magic trick ever under the sun\
Perfectly executed, skillfully done\
Wolfman, oh Wolfman, oh Wolfman, howl\
Rub-a-dub-dub, it\'s a murder most foul
