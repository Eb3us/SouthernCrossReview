<p class="intro">Vienna: it was my last meeting before mandatory retirement, something
I myself had mandated. I had noticed that old people never want to let
go; my father and his father were like that. My grandfather was still
haunting the Board meetings at ninety. My father merely held onto the
company’s reins until 75, when I took over. Although I knew that I would
also some day reach the age of mandatory retirement, I mandated it
anyway; 65 seems as remote to thirty-year-olds as thirty does to
teenagers.</p>
<p>General Meetings are still always held in romantic foreign places.
Considering that our head office and main manufacturing units are in
Milwaukee, almost anywhere fits the description. This has the dual
advantage of keeping everyone in a good mood and limiting the number of
stockholders attending. I arrived a day early, wishing to renew my
acquaintance with Vienna, a city very rich in history and beauty and
blood and which never changes, at least outwardly.</p>
<p>A block of rooms had been reserved at the Intercontinental, where the
meeting was to be held. It has excellent facilities for large company
meetings. I, however, booked a room for myself at the Imperial Hotel. It
has not changed since the nineteenth century – at least outwardly.
Everything is as it always has been, except for the plumbing, and even
that is kept highly polished. My younger colleagues, who little knew
what they were missing, smiled at my eccentricity. But I didn’t care.
There was to be a “surprise” dinner party in my honor in the
Intercontinental after the meeting, at which I would give a maudlin
speech and leave early so the others wouldn’t be frustrated by my
avuncular presence.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of my arrival, I strolled down the Kärntner Ring to
the OpernGasse, then back to Kärntner-Strasse. It was autumn and a chill
was in the air. I looked through the window of the Café Sperl, where
decades ago Anne-Marie and I had spent many a pleasant post-theater or
opera hour with a bottle of clear white Austrian wine, before repairing
to the Imperial for what any healthy young couple would do in such
sumptuous old-world circumstances. The catch was – isn’t there always
one? – that Anne-Marie was descended from minor Austrian nobility and
she was, or would someday be, rich. I was neither rich – although I
later became so – nor would I ever be nobility or even Austrian. In fact
I was a mere sergeant in the U.S. Army, lucky enough to be stationed in
Vienna during the Cold War. I eventually went home and Anne-Marie
married some filthy rich Austrian nobleman.</p>
<p>The café looked as it always had, outwardly <em>and</em> inwardly.
The marble-topped tables, comfortable wooden chairs, newspapers hanging
from racks to be read free of charge, wonderful coffee from Brazil or
Colombia, but prepared a la Viennese, and sweet cakes. I entered, walked
through cigar smoke (smoking still permitted, even encouraged) towards
the rear and “my” corner table.</p>
<p>It was occupied by someone who, to me, was very strange – so strange
in fact that I froze in my tracks and, I fear, gawked at him. He was me
(or I was he) forty years ago. Do I remember what I looked like forty
years ago? Of course, I have photographs – taken, in fact, now that I
mention it, by Anne-Marie. He was totally me, at least outwardly. Should
I approach and ask him if or why he is me, or turn and run. I was slowly
approaching him without realizing it until I was alongside his table. He
looked up from reading his newspaper, the <em>Wiener Zeitung</em>, and
glanced at me quizzically. “Excuse me,” I said, “but I…” He nodded,
indicated one of the empty chairs with his hand and went back to
reading. He understood me to want to ask if one of the other chairs at
his table (there were two unoccupied ones) was free. In Austria one has
the <em>right</em> to sit at any table with an unoccupied chair; it is,
however, considered good manners to ask if the chair in question is
free.</p>
<p>I sat down and the waiter appeared almost instantly and wiped my part
of the already spotless table with his cloth. My erstwhile Doppelgänger,
seeing that I paid no attention to the waiter, said to me in slightly
accented English, with a smile “He wants your order, sir.” Of course, I
had spoken to him in English. And why not, since he was me, although I
do speak German. “Oh, I see, just coffee,” I said to the waiter in
English. He nodded as though to a simpleton and vanished.</p>
<p>I decided to come directly to the point, something I often do and has
contributed much to my success in business and, alas, the failures in my
personal life - or perhaps it’s the other way round. “Have you noticed,
young man, the similarity in our appearances.” I could have said that we
look alike, but such direct speech, even from me, is not appropriate in
Vienna. He seemed surprised as he looked me over. I was dressed in what
for me is informal attire – gray slacks and a sports jacket, light-blue
speckled tie, loafers. He was in jeans with a hole in one knee, a pink
sweater (no discernible shirt), running shoes and white socks. Of course
nowadays any CEO might dress that way, so there was no way of telling
his social status. His hair, by the way, was so long it touched his
shoulders, but at least it was clean. I had little hair left to boast
about. He weighed at least thirty pounds less than me.</p>
<p>“Why yes, there is a resemblance,” he admitted, concentrating on my
face. “You look like my father.”</p>
<p>I leaned closer to him. “But you see, it’s more than that. I have
photos, I could show you that when I was your age…24?…25?” He nodded.
“…I looked exactly like you. It’s uncanny.”</p>
<p>“Is that so?” he said, humoring me, I felt. “Coincidences are often
most interesting.”</p>
<p>I shook my head. “No, I think it’s more than mere coincidence.”</p>
<p>“Do you? Why?”</p>
<p>“What I mean to say is what if you really are me…as I was then? I
mean…”</p>
<p>“Daniel,” a young woman who had suddenly materialized at our table
said in German, “we must hurry. The train is at 10.30 and if we miss it
there’s not another one until tomorrow.”</p>
<p>I stood up, as a gentleman should: she was Anne-Marie, exactly as I
remembered her face, her figure, her graceful body langauge. Her clothes
were very different though: plaid mini-skirt, black blouse barely
covering braless breasts. I couldn’t take my eyes off her. The young man
also stood, not for the presence of a lady, but because she was
insisting on him leaving with her in order to catch a train. She glanced
at me curiously. The young man, Me, Daniel, not realizing that I
understood, said in German, “This guy thinks we look so much alike that
he’s me.” He laughed. “Or I’m him.” He bowed slightly to me and said,
“Auf wiedersehen.” To her he said, “I’ll get a taxi,” and hurried
out.</p>
<p>Anne-Marie just stood there looking at me. She was only an inch or
two shorter. She held her hand out. I bent over and kissed it. “Come on,
Annie, the taxi’s waiting,” Daniel said from the entrance. When she
didn’t move, he said, “What’s the matter?”</p>
<p>“Well, if that’s what you look like when you’re an old fart it’s not
so bad,” she said, smiling at me. It was impossible to know whether she
was speaking about me or to me. She shook her head and passed her hand -
the one I’d kissed - over her eyes as though wiping away cobwebs. Then
she turned and joined Daniel, Me, at the exit and the taxi and the train
to…I’ve often wondered where to..</p>
<p>I never saw them again. Oh, I was fascinated by those events, but I
decided that if I tried to follow them up, to investigate the
possibility that one or more individuals can live more than one earthly
life simultaneously, that is, reincarnate before dying, I might go mad.
At the very least everyone else would think me mad. I did consider the
alternative of a parallel universe, but that was even weirder, so I
dropped it…outwardly at least.</p>
