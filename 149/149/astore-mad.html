<h3>The Madness of Nuclear Warfare, Alive and Well in America</h3>
<br />

</header>

<main>
<p class="intro">Hey, cheer up because it truly is a beauty! I’m talking about this
country’s latest “stealth bomber,” the B-21 Raider, <a
href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/12/02/b-21-bomber-raider-air-force-northrop/">just
revealed</a> by <a
href="https://www.northropgrumman.com/what-we-do/air/b-21-raider/10-facts-about-northrop-grummans-b-21-raider/">Northrop
Grumman</a>, the company that makes it, in all its glory. With its
striking bat-winged shape and its ability to deliver a very big bang (as
in nuclear weapons), it’s our very own “bomber of the future.” As
Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin put it at its explosive debut, it will
“fortify America’s ability to deter aggression, today and into the
future.” Now, that truly makes me proud to be an American.</p>
<p>And while you’re at it, on this <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction">MAD</a>
(as in mutually assured destruction) world of ours, let that scene, that
peculiar <a
href="https://bracingviews.com/2022/11/28/a-peculiar-form-of-american-madness/">form
of madness</a>, involving the potential end of everything on Planet
Earth, sink in. As a retired Air Force officer, it reminded me all too
vividly of my former service and brought to mind the old motto of the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_Air_Command">Strategic Air
Command</a> (SAC), “Peace Is Our Profession.” Headed in its proudest
years by the notorious <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtis_LeMay">General Curtis
LeMay</a>, it promised “peace” via the threat of the total nuclear
annihilation of America’s enemies. </p>
<p><span id="anchor"></span>SAC long controlled two “legs” of this
country’s nuclear triad: its land-based bombers and intercontinental
ballistic missiles, or ICBMs. During the Cold War, those Titans,
Minutemen, and MX “Peacekeepers” were kept on constant alert, ready to
pulverize much of the planet at a moment’s notice. It didn’t matter that
this country was likely to be pulverized, too, in any war with the
Soviet Union. What mattered was remaining atop the nuclear pile. A
concomitant benefit was keeping conventional wars from spinning out of
control by threatening the nuclear option or, as was said at the time,
“<a
href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/is-trump-changing-the-definition-of-go-nuclear">going
nuclear</a>.” (In the age of Biden, it’s “<a
href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/07/politics/joe-biden-vladimir-putin-armageddon-analysis/index.html">Armageddon</a>.”)</p>
<p>Luckily, since the atomic destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in
1945, the world hasn’t gone nuclear again and yet this country’s
military continues, with the help of weapons makers like Northrop
Grumman, to hustle down that very path to Armageddon. Once upon a time,
the absurdity of all this was captured by Stanley Kubrick’s masterpiece,
the satirical 1964 film <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Strangelove"><em>Dr.
Strangelove</em></a>, which featured a “war room” in which there was
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAeqVGP-GPM">no fighting</a>,
even as its occupants oversaw a nuclear doomsday. Sadly enough, that
movie still seems eerily relevant nearly 60 years later in a world
lacking the Soviet Union, where the threat of nuclear war nonetheless
looms ever larger. What gives?</p>
<p>The short answer is that America’s leaders, like their counterparts
in Russia and China, seem to have a collective death wish, a shared
willingness to embrace the most violent and catastrophic weapons in the
name of peace.</p>
<p><strong>Nuclear Bombers and ICBMs Return!</strong></p>
<p>There’s nothing magical about the nuclear triad. It’s <a
href="https://www.csmonitor.com/layout/set/amphtml/1982/1210/121054.html">not
the Holy “Trinity</a>,” as a congressman from Florida said long ago.
Even so, it’s worshipped by the U.S. military in its own
all-too-expensive fashion. America’s triad consists of bombers capable
of carrying nuclear weapons (B-52s, B-1s, B-2s, and someday B-21s),
those land-based ICBMs, and that most survivable “leg,” the U.S. Navy’s
Trident-missile-firing submarines. No other country has a triad quite as
impressive (if that’s the word for it), nor is any other country
planning to spend up to <a
href="https://www.businessinsider.com/nuclear-modernization-plans-are-unnecessarily-costly-and-risky-2021-7">$2
trillion</a> over the next three decades “modernizing” it. The Air
Force, of course, controls the first two legs of that triad and isn’t
about to give them up just because they’re redundant to America’s
“defense” (given those submarines), while constituting a threat to life
on this planet.</p>
<p>Recently, when the Air Force <a
href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/northrop-grumman-set-unveil-b-21-nuclear-bomber-us-air-force-2022-12-02/">unveiled</a>
that <a
href="https://tomdispatch.com/william-astore-enabling-armageddon/">B-21
Raider</a>, its latest nuclear-capable bomber, we learned that it looks
much like its predecessor, the B-2 Spirit, with its bat-like shape
(known as a “flying wing” design) driven by stealth or the avoidance of
radar detection. The Air Force plans to buy “at least” 100 of those
planes at a projected cost of roughly $750 million each. Count on one
thing, though: with the inevitable delays and cost overruns associated
with any high-tech military project these days, the flyaway cost will
likely exceed $1 billion per plane, or at least $100 billion of your
taxpayer dollars (and possibly even <a
href="https://www.commondreams.org/news/2022/12/02/millions-americans-lack-adequate-health-coverage-pentagon-has-new-nuclear-bomber">$200
billion</a>).</p>

<p>Four years ago, when I first <a
href="https://tomdispatch.com/william-astore-enabling-armageddon/">wrote</a>
about the B-21, its estimated cost was $550 million per plane, but you
know the story, right? <a
href="https://tomdispatch.com/william-astore-a-wasteful-weapon-for-america-s-forever-wars/">The
F-35</a> was supposed to be a low-cost, multi-role fighter jet. A
generation later, by the Air Force’s own admission, it’s now a <a
href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2021/02/23/the-us-air-force-just-admitted-the-f-35-stealth-fighter-has-failed/?sh=bdf0591b169b">staggeringly
expensive “Ferrari”</a> of a plane, sexy in appearance but <a
href="https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/politics/a35631305/f-35-doesnt-work-1-7-trillion-dollars/">laden
with flaws</a>. Naturally, the B-21 is advertised as a multi-role bomber
that can carry “conventional” or non-nuclear munitions as well as
thermonuclear ones, but its main reason for being is its alleged ability
to put nuclear bombs on target, even without Slim Pickens (“Major Kong”
in Kubrick’s <em>Dr. Strangelove</em>) <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snTaSJk0n_Y">riding down</a> on
one of them.</p>
<p>The main arguments for expensive nuclear bombers are that they can be
launched as a show of resolve but also, unlike missiles, recalled, if
necessary. (Or so we hope anyway.) They have a “man in the loop” for
greater targeting flexibility and so complicate the enemy’s defensive
planning. Such arguments may have made some sense in the 1950s and early
1960s, before ICBMs and their sub-launched equivalents were fully mature
technologies, but they’re stuff and nonsense today. If nuclear-capable
nations like Russia and China aren’t already deterred by the hundreds of
missiles with thousands of highly accurate nuclear warheads in America’s
possession, they’re not about to be deterred by a few dozen, or even
100, new B-21 stealth bombers, no matter the recent <a
href="https://spoilsofwar.substack.com/p/b-21-bomber-the-200-billion-tv-commercial">Hollywood-style
hype</a> about them.</p>
<p>Yet logic couldn’t matter less here. What matters is that the Air
Force has had nuclear-capable bombers since those first modified B-29s
that dropped <a
href="https://www.atomicheritage.org/history/little-boy-and-fat-man">Little
Boy and Fat Man</a> on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the generals are
simply not about to give them up — ever. Meanwhile, building any
sophisticated weapons system like the B-21 is sure to employ tens of
thousands of workers. (There are already <a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/dec/03/pentagon-new-strategic-bomber-counter-china">400
parts suppliers</a> for the B-21 scattered across 40 states to ensure
the undying love of the most congressional representatives imaginable.)
It’s also a boondoggle for America’s many merchants of death, especially
the lead contractor, Northrop Grumman.</p>
<p>A reader at my <a
href="https://bracingviews.substack.com/p/wheres-the-antiwar-movement"><em>Bracing
Views</em></a> Substack, a Vietnam veteran, nailed it when he
described his own reaction to the B-21’s unveiling:</p>
<p>“What struck me in my heart (fortunately, I have a great pacemaker)
was the self-assured, almost condescending demeanor of the Secretary [of
Defense], the Hollywood staging and lighting, and the complete absence
of consideration of what cognitive/emotional/moral injuries might be
inflicted on the viewer, never mind experiencing exposure to the actual
bomber and its payload — add in the incredible cost and use of taxpayer
money for a machine and support system that can never actually be used,
or if used, would produce incalculable destruction of people and planet;
again, never mind how all that could have been used to start making
America into a functioning social democracy instead of a declining,
tottering empire.”</p>
<p>Social democracy? Perish the thought. The U.S. economy is propped up
by a militarized Keynesianism tightly embraced by Congress and whatever
administration is in the White House. So, no matter how unnecessary
those bombers may be, no matter how their costs spiral ever upwards,
they’re likely to endure. Look for them flying over a sports stadium
near you, perhaps in 2030 — if, that is, we’re still alive as a
species.</p>
<p>As the Air Force buys new stealth bombers with your tax dollars, they
also plan to purchase a new generation of ICBMs, or a “ground-based
strategic deterrent” in Newspeak, to plant in missile silos in garden
spots like rural Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, and Wyoming. The Air
Force has had ICBMs since the 1960s. Roughly 1,000 of them (though that
service initially requested <a
href="https://bracingviews.com/2017/12/28/the-doomsday-machine-the-madness-of-americas-nuclear-weapons/"><em>10,000</em></a>)
were kept on high alert well into the 1980s. Today’s ICBM force is
smaller, but ever more expensive to maintain due to its age. It’s also
redundant, thanks to the Navy’s more elusive and survivable nuclear
deterrent. But, again, logic doesn’t matter here. Whether needed or not,
the Air Force wants those new land-based missiles just like those
stealth bombers and Congress is all too willing to fund them in your
name.</p>
<p>Ka-ching! But hopefully not ka-boom!</p>
<p>Just as the purchase price for the B-21 project is expected to start
at $100 billion (but will likely <a
href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-17/under-wraps-b-21-bomber-is-seen-costing-203-billion-into-2050s#xj4y7vzkg">far
exceed</a> that), the new ICBMs, known as Sentinels, are also estimated
to cost $100 billion. It brings to mind <a
href="https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/Senator_Everett_Mckinley_Dirksen_Dies.htm">an
old saying</a> (slightly updated): a hundred billion here, a hundred
billion there, and pretty soon you’re talking real money. In a case of
egregious double-dipping, Northrop Grumman is once again the lead
contractor, having recently opened a <a
href="https://www.defensenews.com/air/2022/04/05/heres-the-new-name-of-the-us-air-forces-next-gen-nuke/">$1.4
billion facility</a> to design the new missile in Colorado Springs,
conveniently close to the Air Force Academy and various other Air and
Space Force facilities. Location, location, location!</p>
<p>Why such nuclear folly? The usual reasons, of course. Building
genocidal missiles creates jobs. It’s a boon and a half for the
industrial part of the military-industrial-congressional complex. It’s
considered “healthy” for the communities where those missiles will be
located, rural areas that would suffer economically if the Air Force
bases there were instead dismantled or decommissioned. For that service,
shiny new ICBMs are a budget bonanza, while helping to ensure that the
real “enemy” — and yes, I have the U.S. Navy in mind — won’t end up with
a monopoly on world-ending weaponry.</p>
<p>In the coming decades, expect those “Sentinels” to be planted in
fields far from where most Americans live under the guiding principle
that, if we keep them out of sight, they’ll be out of mind as well. Yet
I can’t help but think that this country’s military is out of its mind
in “planting” them there when the only harvest can be of mass death.</p>
<p><strong>It’s a MAD Old World</strong></p>
<p>As <em>MAD</em> magazine’s Alfred E. Neuman would undoubtedly
have said, “What, me worry?”</p>
<p>Oh, MAD old world that has such nukes in it! Color me astonished, in
fact, that America’s nuclear weapons mix hasn’t changed much since the
1960s. That sort of world-ending persistence should tell us something,
but what exactly? For one thing, that not enough of us can imagine a
brave new world without genocidal nuclear weapons in it.</p>
<p>In 1986, President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev
actually did so. They came close, in fact, to reaching a deal to <a
href="https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2006-09/looking-back-1986-reykjavik-summit">eliminate
nuclear weapons</a>. Sadly, Reagan proved reluctant to abandon his dream
of a nuclear space shield, then popularly known as “Star Wars” or, more
formally, as the Strategic Defense Initiative. Since Reagan, sadly
enough, U.S. presidents have stayed the course on nukes. Most
disappointingly, the <a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/oct/09/nobel-peace-prize-barack-obama">Nobel
Prize-winning</a> Barack Obama spoke of eliminating them, supported by
former <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB116787515251566636">Cold
War stalwarts</a> like Henry Kissinger and George Schultz, only to
abandon that goal, partly to solidify support in the Senate for a
nuclear deal with Iran that, no less sadly, is itself <a
href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2022-07-21/iran-nuclear-deal-joe-biden-ebrahim-raisi-united-states-jcpoa">pretty
much dead</a> and buried today.</p>
<p>If saintly Reagan and saintly Obama couldn’t do it, what hope do
ordinary Americans have of ending our nuclear MADness? Well, to quote a
real saint, Catholic peace activist Dorothy Day, “Our problems stem from
our acceptance of this filthy, rotten system.” It’s hard to think of a
system more filthy or rotten than one that threatens to destroy most
life on our planet, so that this country could in some fashion “win”
World War III.</p>
<p>Win what, exactly? A burnt cinder of a planet?</p>
<p>Look, I’ve known airmen who’ve piloted nuclear bombers. I’ve known <a
href="https://www.afmissileers.org/">missileers</a> responsible for
warheads that could kill millions (if ever launched). My brother guarded
ICBM silos when he was a security policeman in SAC. I sat in the Air
Force’s missile-warning center at <a
href="https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/leaving-cheyenne-mountain/">Cheyenne
Mountain</a> under 2,000 feet of solid granite as we ran computerized
war games that ended in… yep, mutually assured destruction. We were, at
least individually, not insane. We were doing our duty, following
orders, preparing for the worst, while (most of us, anyway) hoping for
the best.</p>
<p>A word of advice: don’t look for those within this <a
href="https://bracingviews.com/2022/05/21/the-murderous-madness-of-trillions-for-nuclear-weapons/">nightmarish
system</a> to change it, not when our elected representatives are part
of the very military-industrial complex that sustains this MADness. Only
an alert and knowledgeable citizenry, with real freedom, could act to do
so for the benefit of humanity. But will we ever do that? </p>
<p>“We’re going backwards as a country,” my wife reminds me — and I fear
that she’s right. She summarized the hoopla at the B-21’s recent
unveiling this way: “Let’s go gaga over a mass-murder machine.”</p>
<p>Collectively, it seems that we may be on the verge of returning to a
nightmarish past, where we lived in fear of a nuclear war that would
kill us all, the tall and the small, and especially the smallest among
us, our children, who really are our future.</p>
<p>My fear: that we’ve already become comfortably numb to it and no
longer can take on that culture of mass death. I say this with great
sadness, as an American citizen and a human being.   </p>
<p>No matter. At least a few of us will have profited from building new
ultra-expensive stealth bombers and shiny new missiles, while ensuring
that mushroom clouds remain somewhere in our collective future. Isn’t
that what life is truly all about?</p>
