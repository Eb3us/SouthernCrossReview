it was my last meeting before mandatory retirement, something I
myself had mandated. I had noticed that old people never want to
let go; my father and his father were like that. My grandfather was
still haunting the Board meetings at ninety. My father merely held
onto the company's reins until 75, when I took over. Although I
knew that I would also some day reach the age of mandatory
retirement, I mandated it anyway; 65 seems as remote to thirty-year-olds as thirty does
to teenagers.</FONT></FONT></P>

General Meetings are still always held in romantic foreign places.
Considering that our head office and main manufacturing units are in
Milwaukee, almost anywhere fits the description. This has the dual
advantage of keeping everyone in a good mood and limiting the
number of stockholders attending. I arrived a day early, wishing to
renew my acquaintance with Vienna, a city very rich in history and
beauty and blood and which never changes, at least outwardly.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Calibri, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 14pt">A
block of rooms had been reserved at the Intercontinental, where the
meeting was to be held. It has excellent facilities for large company
meetings. I, however, booked a room for myself at the Imperial Hotel.
It has not changed since the nineteenth century &ndash; at least
outwardly. Everything is as it always has been, except for the
plumbing, and even that is kept highly polished. My younger
colleagues, who little knew what they were missing, smiled at my
eccentricity. But I didn't care. There was to be a &ldquo;surprise&rdquo;
dinner party in my honor in the Intercontinental after the meeting,
at which I would give a maudlin speech and leave early so the others
wouldn't be frustrated by my avuncular presence. </FONT></FONT>

On the afternoon of my arrival, I strolled down the Kärntner Ring to the OpernGasse, then back to Kärntner-Strasse. It was autumn and a chill was in the air. I looked through the window of the Café Sperl, where decades ago Anne-Marie and I had spent many a pleasant post-theater or opera hour with a bottle of clear white Austrian wine, before repairing to the Imperial for what any healthy young couple would do in such sumptuous old-world circumstances. The catch was  isn't there always one?  that Anne-Marie was descended from minor Austrian nobility and she was, or would someday be, rich. I was neither rich  although I later became so  nor would I ever be nobility or even Austrian. In fact I was a mere sergeant in the U.S. Army, lucky enough to be stationed in Vienna during the Cold War. I eventually went home and Anne-Marie married some filthy rich Austrian nobleman. </FONT></FONT></P>

inwardly. The marble-topped tables, comfortable wooden chairs,
newspapers hanging from racks to be read free of charge, wonderful
coffee from Brazil or Colombia, but prepared a la Viennese, and sweet
cakes. I entered, walked through cigar smoke (smoking still
permitted, even encouraged) towards the rear and &ldquo;my&rdquo;
corner table. </FONT></FONT>

was occupied by someone who, to me, was very strange &ndash; so
strange in fact that I froze in my tracks and, I fear, gawked at him.
He was me (or I was he) forty years ago. Do I remember what I looked
like forty years ago? Of course, I have photographs &ndash; taken, in
fact, now that I mention it, by Anne-Marie. He was totally me, at
least outwardly. Should I approach and ask him if or why he is me, or
turn and run. I was slowly approaching him without realizing it until I was alongside his table. He looked up from reading his
newspaper, the </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Calibri, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 14pt"><I>Wiener
Zeitung</I></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Calibri, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 14pt">,
and glanced at me quizzically. &ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;but
I...&rdquo; He nodded, indicated one of the empty chairs with his
hand and went back to reading. He understood me to want to ask if one
of the other chairs at his table (there were two unoccupied ones) was
free. In Austria one has the </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Calibri, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 14pt"><I>right</I></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Calibri, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 14pt">
to sit at any table with an unoccupied chair; it is, however,
considered good manners to ask if the chair in question is free. </FONT></FONT>

sat down and the waiter appeared almost instantly and wiped my part
of the already spotless table with his cloth. My erstwhile
Doppelg&auml;nger, seeing that I paid no attention to the waiter,
said to me in slightly accented English, with a smile &ldquo;He wants
your order, sir.&rdquo; Of course, I had spoken to him in English.
And why not, since he was me, although I do speak German. &ldquo;Oh,
I see, just coffee,&rdquo; I said to the waiter in English. He nodded
as though to a simpleton and vanished. </FONT></FONT>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Calibri, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 14pt">I
decided to come directly to the point, something I often do and has
contributed much to my success in business and, alas, the failures in
my personal life - or perhaps it's the other way round. &ldquo;Have you noticed, young man, the similarity
in our appearances.&rdquo; I could have said that we look alike, but
such direct speech, even from me, is not appropriate in Vienna. He seemed surprised
as he looked me over. I was dressed in what for me is informal
attire &ndash; gray slacks and a sports jacket, light-blue speckled
tie, loafers. He was in jeans with a hole in one knee, a pink sweater
(no discernible shirt), running shoes and white socks. Of course
nowadays any CEO might dress that way, so there was no way of telling
his social status. His hair, by the way, was so long it touched his
shoulders, but at least it was clean. I had little hair left to boast
about. He weighed at least thirty pounds less than me.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Calibri, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 14pt">Why
yes, there is a resemblance,&rdquo; he admitted, concentrating on my
face. &ldquo;You look like my father.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Calibri, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 14pt">I
leaned closer to him. &ldquo;But you see, it's more than that. I have
photos, I could show you that when I was your age...24?...25?&rdquo;
He nodded. &ldquo;...I looked exactly like you. It's uncanny."</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Calibri, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 14pt">Is
that so?&rdquo; he said, humoring me, I felt. &ldquo;Coincidences are
often most interesting.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Calibri, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 14pt">I
shook my head. &ldquo;No, I think it's more than mere coincidence.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Calibri, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 14pt">Do
you? Why?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>

I mean to say is what if you really are me...as I was then? I
mean...&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Calibri, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 14pt">Daniel,&rdquo;
a young woman who had suddenly materialized at our table said in
German, &ldquo;we must hurry. The train is at 10.30 and if we miss it
there's not another one until tomorrow.&rdquo; </FONT></FONT>

stood up, as a gentleman should: she was Anne-Marie, exactly as I
remembered her face, her figure, her graceful body langauge. Her clothes were very different though: plaid mini-skirt, black blouse barely covering braless breasts. I couldn't take my eyes off her. The young man also
stood, not for the presence of a lady, but because she was insisting
on him leaving with her in order to catch a train. She glanced at me
curiously. The young man, Me, Daniel, not realizing that I understood,
said in German, &ldquo;This guy thinks we look so much alike that
he's me.&rdquo; He laughed. &ldquo;Or I'm him.&rdquo; He bowed
slightly to me and said, &ldquo;Auf wiedersehen.&rdquo; To her he said, I'll get a taxi, and hurried out.<br><br>
Anne-Marie just stood there looking at me. She was only an inch or two shorter. She held her hand out. I bent over and kissed it.
Come on, Annie, the taxi's waiting, Daniel said from the entrance. When she didn't move, he said, What's the matter?<br><br>
Well, if that's what you look like when you're an old fart it's not so bad, she said, smiling at me. It was impossible to know whether she was speaking about me or to me. She shook her head and passed her hand - the one I'd kissed - over her eyes as though wiping away cobwebs. Then she turned and joined Daniel, Me, at the exit and the taxi and the train to...I've often wondered where to..</FONT></FONT></P>

never saw them again. Oh, I was fascinated by those events, but I decided that if I tried to follow them up, to investigate the possibility that one or more individuals can live more than one earthly life simultaneously, that is, reincarnate before dying, I might go mad. At the very least everyone else would think me mad. I did consider the alternative of a parallel universe, but that was even weirder, so I dropped it...outwardly at least.
