<h3>Lecture One of Six – Historical necessities of the Present</h3>


<p>Dornach August 9, 1919 – GA296<br />
Translated by Lisa D. Monges and Doris M. Bugby, revised here</p>

<main>
<p class="intro">A recent series of lectures and discussions has given me deep insight
into what presently takes place in human feelings, into what exists as
an inner tragedy in humanity's evolution. Now I am again able to spend a
few days here in this place which is so closely bound up with the work
we must believe will gradually produce the force to guide the present
tragedy of humanity into more hopeful channels.</p>
<p>Perhaps at no time has there been less inclination than now to raise
the soul to the spiritual worlds in the true sense of the word, and it
is especially necessary now to do so. Only from these spiritual worlds
can come the strength modern humanity requires if it is to advance in
its whole humanity. Today there is the most widespread belief that the
problems and tasks of the present can be resolved by the thoughts and
impulses derived from knowledge based on the external world. How long it
will take until a sufficiently large part of humanity will be convinced
that real salvation is only attainable on the spiritual path, is
extremely difficult to say, for the very reason that reflecting on this
question is not fruitful. It is certain, however, that progress can only
be made if sufficiently large numbers of people are permeated by the
conviction that salvation can come only from the spiritual worlds.</p>
<p>What occupies people's minds today, in the widest circles, are the
social problems. However, they lack the intellectual strength to
earnestly study these problems, because in the present age the
intellectual power of a great part of mankind is as though paralyzed.
The belief prevails that the social problems can be mastered by what is
called knowledge, but they can never be mastered if not from the
viewpoint of spiritual knowledge.</p>
<p>We have just passed through a long war. [World War I,  28 July 1914 –
11 November 1918] This will be followed by prolonged, perhaps very
prolonged fighting by mankind in general. Many people have said that
this war, which has been experienced throughout the civilized world, was
the most terrible experience of its kind since the beginning of history.
We cannot say that this judgment is wrong. The battle which will have to
be fought by this or that means, and which will follow this war — the
battle between Orient and Occident, between Asia, Europe and America —
will be the greatest spiritual battle ever waged by mankind. Everything
that has flowed through the Christian world into humanity as impulses
and forces will pour over civilization in tremendous, elemental waves of
warfare.</p>
<p>It is possible to state today in a simple formula the great contrast
between the Orient and Occident. But this simple formula — do not take
it as simple. It contains an enormous quantity of human impulses. You
know that in my book <em>Toward Social Renewal</em> – <em>Basic Issues
of the Social Question</em> I drew attention to the fact that for
extensive circles of present-day humanity spiritual life has become an
“ideology”; that what constitutes men's spiritual properties — right,
customs, science, art, religion, and so on — is looked upon as merely a
vapor rising from the only true reality, from the economic means of
production, the economic foundation. I spoke to you about these matters
when I took leave of you here several months ago.</p>
<p>Ideology – that is the answer many people give today when spiritual
life is spoken of. It is all something that is mirrored in the human
mind from the only reality: economic reality; it is mere “ideology.”
There is much reason to reflect on the real meaning of this word
“ideology” in world culture for it means a great deal. One can connect
this word with no other word more closely than with the word “maya” of
oriental wisdom. “Maya” — “illusion” — properly translated into
occidental language means “ideology.” Every other translation of this
word is less exact. Thus, we may say: The same concept that the Oriental
connects with the word <em>maya</em> is connected by a great part of
western humanity with the word <em>ideology</em>. But what a tremendous
difference! What does the Oriental think when he uses the word
<em>maya?</em> He thinks that the external world is <em>maya;</em>
everything that confronts our senses and the intellect bound up with
them is <em>maya</em>, the great illusion, and the only reality is what
arises in the soul. What a human being achieves in the sphere of soul
and spirit, that constitutes reality. What arises and comes forth from
man's inner life is reality. What presents itself externally to the
senses is maya, illusion, ideology.</p>
<p>The opposite conviction, that the only reality is what presents
itself to the outer senses, is spread over a great part of Western
humanity. Precisely what the Oriental calls <em>maya</em> constitutes
reality for a great part of Western mankind; and what the Oriental calls
reality, that which blossoms and wells up in the soul, constitutes
<em>ideology</em>, illusion, for a large segment of Europe and
America.</p>
<p>You see here a great contrast. This makes deep inroads into men's
souls; it shapes them across the earth into two quite distinct kinds of
beings. If you survey what has happened in the civilized world in recent
years you will hopefully say: Fundamentally speaking, everything that is
said about the reasons for this world catastrophe is just skimming the
surface, is merely superficial opinion. What has expressed itself in
this terrible fighting has arisen with elemental power from unconscious
depths. It can be clearly seen today that people participated in this
fighting without knowing the reason for it. It is the expression of what
this contrast, which will not be resolved for a long time, has brought
to the surface as elemental forces. The anti-social element at present
is so strong that it has split mankind into these two essentially
different parts.</p>
<p>If you connect what I have just stated with other things I have
explained to you, you will find that the striving of the West is for
<em>freedom</em>. No matter whether this freedom is understood or
misunderstood, the longing for freedom wells up as if from dark
foundations of the human soul. Turn your gaze to the East. What is
called freedom in the West has no real meaning for the East; no concepts
or feelings are connected with it. <em>We do not think about what we
experience most intensely</em>. Just consider how little attention
people give to the phenomena of nature surrounding them every day. They
do not think about their immediate experiences. The Oriental, in
pursuing the reality natural to him, the inner reality, lives in the
freedom he derives from the peculiarities of his race, his folk, and his
tribe. He does not think about it. The further we look toward the West
the more we become aware of the fact that freedom has been lost in the
course of the historical evolution of mankind. Because the Western
peoples do not have it they have to strive for it.</p>
<p>We could cite many more instances; in every one of them we would find
this fundamental difference between West and East. There is already a
first indication of what perhaps will occur in the next few years. At
the moment this manifests in outer symptoms taking place in Asia and
about which Europe is still silent today — silent for well-known
reasons. The fact, for instance, that more than half the population of
India is near starvation will bring to birth, out of the spirituality of
the Indian nation, something that will be very different from what has
happened in Europe. These are outer symptoms. But also, in regard to
these outer symptoms mankind is divided today into two essentially
different parts. For the Indian hunger signifies something totally
different from what it means to the European, because the Indian has
behind him a soul development throughout millennia which is quite
different from that of the European. These facts have to be sharply
focused by anyone who wants to comprehend the course of mankind's
evolution. Today we must be clear that what is usually called the social
question is something much more complicated than is ordinarily imagined.
This social question is an accompanying phenomenon of the culture that
arose after the middle of the fifteenth century. I have repeatedly
spoken to you about this significant incision in the history of
civilized mankind in the middle of the fifteenth century. Since that
time natural science has gradually arisen in its modern coloring. During
that period, however, industrialism also has arisen in its modern
coloring. Natural science and industrialism have been poured over modern
humanity and have given it its particular spiritual trend.</p>
<p>I have spoken to you about the special nature of this natural science
and have told you that intelligent people, who today reflect on what
natural science has to offer, say: what it offers is not the world, it
is rather a ghost of the world. Everything scientists have thought out
and that has become popular education, all this — much more so than is
ordinarily imagined — is belief in a ghostly world; actually
superstition. And along with this world of ghosts exists the spiritual
effect modern industrialism has had upon human beings.</p>
<p>We must give attention now to the spiritual significance of
industrialism. Consider what primarily controls it — the machine. A
machine is different from everything else man makes use of in outer
life. Just consider the animal. If you turn your scientific or other
thoughts to an animal you can carry on any amount of research concerning
an animal, but something always remains, something of a deep and divine
essence. You cannot fathom an animal; you cannot discover its secrets.
There is always something behind your thoughts about an animal that
remains unknown. This is no less the case with a plant. Take even a
crystal, the wonderful forms of crystals. You will have to say:
Certainly we can grasp the external nature of crystals, their forms and
so on, if we are trained in this respect, but much remains that man can
revere and to which his ordinary, non-clairvoyant intellect does not
penetrate.</p>
<p>Now consider a machine. It is entirely transparent to our thinking.
We know how its power is produced, know the position of its pistons, the
magnitude of friction. We can calculate its efficiency if we know the
various factors; there is nothing behind the machine which would lead us
to say that it cannot be penetrated by the ordinary, non-clairvoyant
intellect. This is of great significance for the mutuality of man and
machine. And when one has stood once again before many thousands of
people who have to do with machines, one knows what it is that drips
into these souls from the spiritually transparent machine. For the
machine has nothing behind it that can only be divined, something not
observable by man's non-clairvoyant intellect. That fact that a machine
is so completely transparent that its power and power-relationships lie
clearly open before human senses and intellect — this fact makes contact
with machines so disastrous for humanity. That is what sucks out the
human heart and soul, making man dry and inhuman.</p>
<p>Natural science together with machines threatens human civilization
with a terrible threefold destruction. Now what is this danger
threatening modern man if he does not make up his mind to look to the
super-sensory? In regard to knowledge, that ideal presses to gain
control which the scientists describe as follows: One endeavors to
arrive at an astronomical way of thinking about nature; that is,
thinking fashioned after the pattern of astronomy. When the modern
chemist thinks about the content of a molecule he thinks of the atoms
within the molecule as being in a certain force relationship. He
conceives of it in the form of a small planetary and solar system. To
explain the whole world astronomically becomes an ideal. And astronomy
itself, what is its ideal? To conceive of the whole world-structure as a
machine! Now add to this the work people do by machine!</p>
<p>These are the influences that have become increasingly strong since
the middle of the fifteenth century and rob men of their humanity. If
they were to continue thinking in the way they think about machine-like
astronomy and about the industrialism in which they work, human spirits
would become mechanized; human souls vegetable-like, sleepy; and human
bodies animalized.</p>
<p>Look toward America, the climax of the mechanization of the human
spirit! Look toward the European East, toward Russia, the wild and
frightful impulses and instincts that run riot there — the animalization
of the body. In the middle, in Europe, the sleepiness of the soul.
Mechanization of the spirit, vegetationalizing of the soul,
animalization of the body — this is what we have to face without
deceiving ourselves.</p>
<p>It is characteristic of humanity's path since the middle of the
fifteenth century that not only two life-elements have been lost but
also a third. Today a powerful party calls itself “social democracy.” In
other words, it welds together socialism and democracy although they are
the opposite of each other. This party welds them together and leaves
out the spirit. For socialism can only refer to economic life, democracy
only to the sphere of civil rights, and individualism would refer to
spiritual life. Freedom has been omitted from the phrase “social
democracy,” otherwise it would have to be called “individualistic social
democracy.” Then all three aspects of human concern would come to
expression in such a title. But it is characteristic of the modern age
that the third element has been omitted; that the spirit has really
become <em>maya</em>, the great illusion for civilized humanity of the
West, for Europe and its colonial outgrowth, America. This is what we
have to bear in mind when we consider spiritual science in the sense of
a great cultural question. What lives in the demands of the present
cannot in reality be a subject for discussion. <em>These are historical
demands</em>. Socialism is an historical demand. But liberalism,
freedom, individualism, these also are an historical demand, although
they have been little noticed by modern men. People will no longer have
anything to say unless they establish the social organism in the sense
of the threefold order: socialism for economic life, democracy for
rights or the political state, and freedom or individualism for
spiritual life.</p>
<p>This will have to be looked upon as the real, the only salvation of
mankind. But we must not delude ourselves about the fact that precisely
these intensive, unyielding historical demands of the present age create
other demands for one who has deeper insight into these matters. Adults
will have to live in a social organism which, in regard to the economic
aspect, will be social; in regard to government, democratic; and for the
spiritual aspect, liberal, free. The great problem of the future will be
that of education. How will we have to deal with children so that they,
as adults, can grow into the social, democratic, and spiritually free
areas of living in the most comprehensive way? Spiritual science has
pointed to this problem of education as present-day humanity will have
to understand it if it wishes to advance. Social demands will remain
chaotic if it is not seen that at their base lies the most urgent
problem of the present time: the problem of education. If you wish to
acquaint yourselves with the broad guidelines concerning this problem of
education you only need to study my little book, <em>Education of The
Child From The Point Of View Of Spiritual Science</em>. Here one of the
most important questions of the present time has been brought to the
surface, namely, the social question of education. The widest circles of
modern humanity will have to learn what spiritual science has to offer
in regard to the three epochs of the human being's youth and
development.</p>
<p>In this book it has been pointed out that between birth and the
seventh year, which is the year when the change of teeth occurs, a child
is an imitative being, he does what he sees in his surroundings. If you
observe him with real understanding you will find that he is an
imitative being who does what the grownups do. It is of utmost
importance for a child that the people in his surroundings do only what
he may imitate; indeed, that they think and feel only what is wholesome
for him to imitate. When a child enters physical existence he only
continues the experiences he had in the spiritual world prior to
conception. There we live, as human beings, within the beings of the
higher hierarchies; we do what originates as impulses from the nature of
the higher hierarchies. There we are imitators to a much higher degree
because we are united with the beings we imitate. Then we are placed
into the physical world. In it we continue our habit of being one with
our surroundings. This habit then extends to being one with, imitating,
the people around us who have to take care of a child's education by
doing, thinking, and feeling only what he may imitate. Benefit for a
child is all the greater the more he is able to live not in his own soul
but in those within his environment.</p>
<p>In the past when man's life was more instinctive he could also rely
instinctively on this imitation. This will not be the case in the
future. Then care will have to be taken that a child be an imitator. In
education the question will have to be answered: How can we best shape
the life of a child so that he may imitate his surroundings in the best
possible way? What has happened in the past in regard to this imitation
will have to become increasingly intensive and conscious in the future.
For people will have to make clear to themselves that when children are
grown to adulthood in society they will have to be free human beings,
and <em>one can become free only if as a child one has been a most
intensive imitator</em>. This natural power of a child must be strongly
developed precisely for the time when socialism will break in upon us.
People will not become free beings, in spite of all declaiming and
political wailing about freedom, if the power of imitation is not
implanted in them in the age of childhood. Only if this is done will
they as adults have the basis for social freedom.</p>
<p>From the seventh year of life until puberty, until the fourteenth and
fifteenth year, there lives in a child what may be called action based
on authority. When a child undertakes what he does because a revered
personality in his surroundings says to him, “This is right, this should
be done,” then it is the greatest blessing that could happen to him.
Nothing is worse than for a child to get accustomed to making his
so-called own judgments too early, prior to puberty. A feeling for
authority between the ages of seven and fourteen will in future have to
be developed more intensively than has been done in the past. All
education in this period of life will have to be consciously directed
toward awaking in a child a pure, beautiful feeling for authority; for
what is to be implanted in him during these years is to form the
foundation for what the adult is to experience in the social organism as
the equal rights of men. Equal rights among men will not come into
existence in any other way, because <em>people will never become ripe
for these equal rights if in childhood regard for authority has not been
implanted in them</em>. In the past a lesser degree of feeling for
authority might have sufficed; in future it will not be so. This feeling
will have to be strongly implanted in a child in order to let him mature
for that which is not open to argument but arises as an historical
demand.</p>
<p>All primary school education in our time must be organized in a way
to let people attain this view of the situation. Now I ask you: How far
are people today, how far is modern teacher-training from an insight
into these things? How must we work if this insight is to be gained?
<em>And it must be gained</em>, because only if this is firmly achieved
can salvation come.</p>
<p>If today one visits those countries which have the first revolution
already behind them, what does one experience in regard to their
programs for so-called “consolidated schools”? What are their programs?
To the person who has insight into the relationships existing in human
nature, their socialistic educational programs are the most terrifying
imaginable. The most awful, frightening things to be thought out and
placed before mankind today are the school programs, the curricula, the
organized education connected with the name <em>Lunatscharski</em>, the
Russian Minister of Education. The educational program developed in
Russia murders all true socialism. But also in other regions of Europe
the educational programs are actually cancerous evils, particularly the
socialist programs of education, because they proceed from the almost
unbelievable principle that schools must be established after the
pattern of adult life in the social organism. I have read school
programs whose first principle is the abolition of head-masters; the
teachers should stand in a relationship of absolute equality with the
students, the entire school should be built on comradeship. If one
speaks against such a principle today, let us say in southern Germany
where matters have not advanced as far as other regions in this respect,
then one is branded as a person who does not understand anything about
social life.</p>
<p>Those people, however, who are in earnest in regard to the creation
of a truly social organism, must above everything else be clear about
the fact that such an organism can never arise with the socialistic
programs for education. Because, if socialism is introduced into schools
it cannot exist in life. People become mature for a socially just life
together only if during their school years their life has been built
upon true authority. We must realize today how far removed from any
sense of reality is what people do and think.</p>
<p>After puberty, between the fourteenth and twenty-first years, not
only the life of sexual love develops in man; this develops merely as a
special manifestation of universal human love. This power of universal
human love should be specially fostered when children leave the primary
school and go to trade schools or other institutions. For the
configuration of economic life, which is a demand of history, will never
be warmed through as it should be by brotherly love — that is, universal
human love — if this is not developed during the years between fourteen
and twenty-one.</p>
<p>Brotherliness, fraternity, in economic life as it has to be striven
for in future, <em>can only arise in human souls if education after the
fifteenth year works consciously toward universal human love</em>. That
is, if all concepts regarding the world and education itself are based
on human love, love toward the outer world.</p>
<p>Upon this threefold educational basis must be erected what is to
flourish for mankind's future. If we do not know that the physical body
must become an imitator in the right way we shall merely implant animal
instincts in this body. If we are not aware that between the seventh and
fourteenth year the ether/life body passes through a special development
that must be based on authority, there will develop in man merely a
universal, cultural drowsiness, and the force needed for the rights
organism will not be present. If from the fifteenth year onward we do
not infuse all education in a sensible way with the power of love that
is bound to the astral body, people will never be able to develop their
astral bodies into independent beings. These things intertwine.
Therefore, I must say:</p>
<p>Proper imitation develops freedom;</p>
<p>Authority develops the rights life;</p>
<p>Fraternity, love, develops economic life.</p>
<p>But turned about it is also true. When love is not developed in the
right way, freedom is lacking; and when imitation is not developed in
the right way, animal instincts grow rampant.</p>
<p>Thus, in dealing with this problem you see that spiritual science is
the proper basis for what must become the content of culture precisely
because of the great historical demands that arise today for mankind.
Without this content of culture, which can flow only from spiritual
science, we cannot make any progress. That is to say, the questions
confronting us must be brought into a spiritual atmosphere; this, as a
conviction, must enter human souls. I should like to emphasize once more
that the length of time it will take for such a conviction to take root
may be debated, but in any case, what people unconsciously strive for
can in no way be reached without this conviction. I believe you can see
from this the connection between what has been carried on in various
fields through our spiritual science and what arises from the distress
of the age as the great historical necessities for mankind in the
present and immediate future. This was the reason for my statement that
spiritual science must be considered in its relationship to the great
historical tasks of the present. Of course, people are far, far from
judging matters in the way I have characterized. There must first arise
in them a tension of dissatisfaction, so that out of the very opposite,
purely materialistic striving there may arise the striving for
spirituality. Otherwise, how are people to tackle the problem that has
led them to use the expressions <em>maya</em>, and <em>ideology</em>, so
adversely?</p>
<p>What has resulted from this? You will realize that the impulses
behind Oriental and Occidental thinking are very different; but the
peculiar thing is that they have produced the same feeling throughout
both. This soul orientation has to be considered. That the people of the
East described the outer world as <em>maya</em> is of ancient origin.
This mystical concept of the world had its great significance then, but
it is not significant at present. Because in a sense it has become
outmoded. The Orient has been overtaken by a certain passive surrender
to it; by a false fatalism which, through the Turkish element, has
influenced Europe in the crudest manner. Fatalism, an attitude of
let-happen-what-may, signifies the passivity of the human will.</p>
<p>In the most precise way the Occidental concept of <em>ideology</em>
arose in the same sphere of fatalism through Marx and Engels. This
concept is the modern socialistic doctrine that everything of a
psychical-spiritual nature originates in the one and only reality: the
economic process, and so is <em>maya, ideology</em>.</p>
<p>How did this doctrine arise? By bringing something fatalistic into
the world. Up until the catastrophe of the World War what then was the
outer expression of the socialistic doctrine? It was: capital
accumulates, concentrates; bigger and bigger groups of capitalists
arise, trusts, monopolies, etc. The economic process of increased
concentration of capitalistic groups will run its course quite by itself
until the moment arrives when, of itself, the control of capital passes
to the proletariat. Nothing has to be done to bring it about, it is an
objective, purely economic process. Fatalism.</p>
<p>The Orient arrived at fatalism: the Occident proceeds from fatalism,
the majority of the people supporting it. Most people are fatalistic. To
submit to what the world process is to bring has become the principle of
the Orient. It is also the principle of the Occident. For the Orient,
however, it is submission to something spiritual; for the Occident it is
submission to the material, economic process. In both cases human
evolution is seen in a one-sided way. But if we survey evolution as it
is today, resulting from former conditions, we find in it a spiritual
element that has become <em>ideology</em>, as I have described. This
spiritual element is based on Greek culture. The deepest impulse of our
souls has a Greek character. Therefore, we have the classical school
(<em>Gymnasium</em>), which is an imitation of the Greek mental
structure in education. In Greece this structure was natural to the
growing child up to puberty, for the great mass of the people were the
poor people, the slaves, the helots, who were excluded from such
education. The conquerors were of different blood. They were the bearers
of spiritual life, justifiably so. You can see this expressed in Greek
sculpture. Look at a Mercury head (I have often mentioned this) with the
special position of the ears, nose, and eyes. In this head the Greeks
pointed to that part of the population they had conquered and to whose
care they left the outer life of trade, the economy. The spirit had been
bestowed by cosmic powers upon the Aryan, characterized by the head of
Zeus, of Hera, of Athene.</p>
<p>Do not believe that the Greek soul structure comes only to expression
in the general soul constitution. It also expresses itself in the
formation of word and sentence in the Greek language. This rests upon an
aristocratic soul structure. We have this still in our spiritual life.
When the middle of the fifteenth century approached, we did not
experience a renewal of spiritual life but only a Renaissance or a
Reformation, a refurbishing of the old.</p>
<p>We educate our youth in the classical schools estranged from life. It
was self-evident for the Greeks to educate their youth as we do in our
<em>Gymnasium</em>, because that was their life. They educated their
children and their youth in accordance with their life; we educate youth
in our classical schools according to Greek life. For that reason our
spiritual life has become world-estranged and is considered to be
ideology. Its thoughts are too short-sighted to embrace life, and, above
everything, to intervene actively in life through deeds.</p>
<p>Beside this element of spiritual education there lives in us a
strange education in the field of law. It can be shown in all spheres of
life that the middle of the fifteenth century constitutes a mighty
incision in humanity's evolution. Grain is expensive today, and
everything produced from grain is expensive. It is excessively
expensive! If one investigates when it was excessively cheap in European
countries one comes to the ninth and tenth centuries. At that time, it
was just as much too cheap as today it is too expensive. But in the
middle of the fifteenth century it had a normal price.</p>
<p>It is interesting to see how, right down to the price of grain, the
fifteenth century shows this great incision in history. At that time
when the price of grain was fair over a great part of Europe, the
ancient serfdom gradually ceased to exist. But then, in order to destroy
this beginning of freedom, Roman law started to become dominant. Today,
in the sphere of politics, of rights, we are permeated by Roman law,
just as we are permeated in the sphere of spiritual life by the spirit
and soul structure of the Greeks. In the sphere of rights, we have been
unable to produce anything but a renaissance of Roman law. So, in our
social organism we have the Greek spiritual structure and the Roman
State structure.</p>
<p>Economic life cannot be shaped as a renaissance. Of course, it is
possible to live according to Roman law, and we can educate our children
according to the spiritual structure of the Greeks; but we cannot eat
what the Greeks ate because this would not satisfy our hunger. Economic
life must arise as a part of the present time. Thus, we have the
European life of economics as the third element. Since these three areas
of living are chaotically intermingled, it is necessary that we bring
order into them. This can only be done through the threefold social
organism.</p>
<p>In a most one-sided manner people like Marx and Engels have realized
that, for they recognized that it will no longer do to govern with a
spiritual life that originates in ancient Greece; nor will it do to live
with a government that has been derived from Roman law. Nothing remains
but economic life, they said, so they concentrated exclusively upon
that. Engels said: In future only commodities and the processes of
production must be administered and directed; human beings must no
longer be governed. This is just as one-sided as it is correct; correct,
but terribly one-sided.</p>
<p>Economic life must rest on its own basis. Within the economic member
of the social organism only goods — commodities — must be managed and
the processes of production directed. This must become independent. But
if one eliminates from the social organism the life of rights and the
spiritual life in their old form, one must establish them in a new form.
That is to say, alongside economic life, which manages goods and directs
the processes of production, we need the democratic life of the state,
which is based on equality. We need not a mere renaissance of Roman law
but a new birth of the life of the state on the basis of equality. We
need no mere renaissance of spiritual life as it existed at the
beginning of the modern era. We need a new form, a new creation of
spiritual life. We must become conscious of the fact that we are really
confronted now with the task of creating spiritual/cultural life
anew.</p>
<p>What has been stated by the demand for the threefold society or
social organism is connected with that which in the deepest sense lives
in the development of modern humanity. This idea is not the result of a
brainstorm, it is something born of the deepest needs of our age,
something that corresponds in the highest degree to our present time.
There are many people who say they do not understand this, that it is
very difficult. In Germany, when people said over and over that these
things are difficult to understand, I said to them that I certainly do
make a distinction between these ideas and what one has become
accustomed to understand during the last four or five years. One thought
it easy to understand things then. So I said: things that merely had to
be commanded to be understood. The Supreme Headquarters or another place
of authority commanded that matters had to be understood, then they
certainly were crammed into one's head. They were understood because one
was commanded to understand. What is of importance now is to understand
something out of one's free human mind. To that end it is necessary for
people to wake up. For this, however, there is very little inclination,
yet events will depend upon it. Difficulties do not arise from a subject
being incomprehensible, but from a lack of will. It is courage that is
lacking, courage to look into this reality. It is self-evident that what
must speak in a new tone to humanity must be formulated in sentences
different from those which people have been accustomed to thus far. For
we have been grasped by three things that are different from what this
threefold social organism requires.</p>
<p>In this threefold society a renewal of spiritual life is demanded in
a way that lets people feel a vital connection of their soul with
objective spiritual life. They do not now have this connection. When
people speak today they speak in hollow phrases. They do this because
they have no relationship to what these hollow phrases are supposed to
express. People have lost their connection with spiritual, therefore
their words have become empty talk.</p>
<p>Much has been said about rights in recent years, about the
establishment of rights among civilized mankind. The events of the
present time demonstrate sufficiently how far removed from reality they
are today in regard to human rights. They have not fought for rights,
only for power, but they have talked about rights.</p>
<p>Now how is it with economic life? There have been no thoughts that
would have encompassed economic life, therefore events have taken place
of themselves. The characteristic factor in economic life has been
continuous production, as I described it in Vienna in the spring of 1914
when I called this continuous producing of goods a social cancer.
Commodities were produced and thrown on the market at random; the whole
economic process was to take place of itself, not thoughtfully directed.
A chaotic economic life without direction; a life of rights become a
mere striving for power; a spiritual life degraded to hollow phrases:
this is the threefold character of social life we have had and of which
we must rid ourselves. We can only get rid of it if we know how to take
seriously what is meant by the threefold social organism.</p>
<p>But this can only be understood if we relate it back to
anthroposophically oriented spiritual science. People were annoyed when
in a public lecture some weeks ago I made a statement which, however, is
a fundamental truth. I said: The leading circles of the present time
must no longer rely on their brains, which have become decadent. They
must rise to a comprehension that does not need the brain, but the ether
body. For the thoughts that must be grasped in our spiritual science do
not need the brain. The leading circles, the middle class of today, the
bourgeoisie, just because of their physiological development, must
submit to the development of spiritual knowledge that can be fostered
even with decadent brains.</p>
<p>The proletariat, the working class, strives upward. It still has
unused brains. The lemon hasn't yet been completely squeezed dry;
something of an atavistic character still comes out of the brain.
Therefore, the proletariat still understands what is said in the sense
of the new order of things. The situation today is such that the entire
proletariat would be receptive to these things, but not their leaders,
for they have become bourgeois. They have become greater philistines
than the real philistines. They have taken over philistinism and have
developed it into a high culture. But on the other hand there exists a
terrible penchant for obedience. This obedience will first have to be
broken, otherwise there will be no salvation here either.</p>
<p>You see, matters are more complicated in the present age than we
ordinarily imagine, and only the science of initiation can lead to a
understanding of the social problems of our time. There are three
concepts you may also find in my book, <em>Toward Social Renewal</em>,
which I have written not only for anthroposophists but for the general
public. You will find three important concepts in present-day social
life: (1) the concept of commodity, the product, the goods in economic
life; (2) the concept of labor; (3) the concept of capital. The social
thinking of the present adheres to these three concepts.</p>
<p>How much has been proclaimed in social science in order to comprehend
these three concepts! Whoever knows what has arisen in the second half
of the nineteenth century on the subject of a scientific national
economy, trying to penetrate these concepts of commodity, labor, and
capital, knows the impossible science the economists have achieved. It
is totally inadequate. I have recently quoted a neat example of this.
The famous Professor Lujo Brentano, the luminary of national economic
science in middle Europe at the present time, has recently written an
article entitled, <em>The Entrepreneur</em>, in which he develops three
marks of distinction for the entrepreneur. I shall only mention the
third one, the use of the means of production at one's own risk. The
entrepreneur is the owner of the means of production and undertakes
production for the market at his own risk. Now, Brentano so formulates
his concept in that article that he is able to designate a further
entrepreneur beside the manufacturer and industrialist, namely, the
modern laborer. The workman is an entrepreneur because he has the means
of production, that is, his own labor-force, and this he offers on the
market at his own risk. Mr. Brentano's concept of the entrepreneur is
crystal clear as it includes the laborer among the entrepreneurs. This
shows how clever modern economic science is! It is ridiculous. But
people are not willing to ridicule such matters because the universities
still take the leading positions in spiritual life. Yet this is what
universities produce in the field of national economy. People do not
have the courage to confess that what is produced in this field is
ridiculous. Matters are truly dreadful.</p>
<p>Our attention, however, must be focused upon such things, therefore
we must ask: Why is it that precisely in regard to social concepts,
which at present become burning questions of the day, all science is
inadequate? It would give me great satisfaction if I could speak to you
more in detail about this question during my present stay here. Today I
shall only give a short report.</p>
<p>Although the concept “commodity” is merely economic it can never be
formulated with ordinary science. You will not arrive at the concept of
“commodity” if you do not base it upon imaginative knowledge. You cannot
grasp “labor” in the social, economic life if you do not base it upon
inspired Knowledge. And you cannot define “capital” if you do not base
it upon intuitive knowledge.</p>
<p>The concept of commodity demands imagination;</p>
<p>The concept of labor demands inspiration;</p>
<p>The concept of capital demands intuition.</p>
<p>If you do not form these concepts in this manner only confusion
results.</p>
<p>You can see in detail why such confusion must result. Why does
Brentano define the concept of “capital,” which coincides with the
concept “entrepreneur,” in a way to call the laborer a capitalist?
Because he is a very clever man of the present day but has no idea that,
in order to gain a real concept of capital, intuitive knowledge is
needed!</p>
<p>In a certain roundabout way, the Bible points to this when it speaks
of capitalism as “mammonism.” It connects capital with a certain kind of
spirituality, but spirituality can only be recognized by intuition. If
we wish to recognize the spirituality active in capitalism — mammonism —
we need intuition. We find this already in the Bible. But today we need
a world conception that raises this to the modern level.</p>
<p>These matters, which today may still be considered queer, must be
penetrated by expert knowledge. Real, expert knowledge in this sphere
will result in the demand for a penetration of social concepts by
genuine, true, spiritual science. This forces itself today upon the
unbiased observer of life. If you were present, you will remember the
memorable question that was asked at the end of my lecture at the
Bernoullianum in Basel, delivered before my journey. In the following
discussion a man asked: “How can it be brought about that Lenin become
the ruler of the world?” For, in that man's opinion there is no hope
unless Lenin rules the world.</p>
<p>Just consider the confusion! Those who today behave most radically
are the most reactionary. They want socialism. Above everything else one
ought to begin by socializing management, but they start their socialism
with the universal economic monarchy of Lenin! Not even a beginning is
made to socialize the relationships of management. This is how grotesque
things are today. The real situation should be kept in mind if someone
says to you that Lenin ought to become world ruler. Those who believe
they have the most enlightened concepts have the most perverted ones,
and clarity in this sphere cannot be attained if there is no will to
seek this clarity in spiritual science.</p>
