# The Return of the Magi

This town is one we\'ve seen before:\
These crooked lanes, that stable door,\
Although it must have been a dream,\
For never were we here before.

And that quick dog, scared and lean,\
Crossing the square scarcely seen\
And the dark-haired girl leaning out\
The hostel window familiar seem.

The sky was lit by the evening star\
As now, but brighter then by far;\
Above us shuddered angels\' wings\
And we had journeyed far, so far.
