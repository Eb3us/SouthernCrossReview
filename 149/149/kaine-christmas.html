<p class="intro">After allowing hope and peace to live in our hearts over the last two
weeks, we now come to joy. <em>Chara</em> is the Greek word for joy.</p>
<p>In chapter 15 of St John’s Gospel are the words, “<em>that my joy may
be in you, and that your joy may be full.”</em> The sign of love is joy,
<em>chara</em>. This is not frivolous happiness; <em>chara</em> is
related to <em>charis</em> which means grace, graciousness and
gratitude. It is a quiet feeling that swells our heart and fills our
whole being with light. We feel humbly confident, strong but not
overpowering, and certainly filled with gratitude.</p>
<p>Joy is a deed, an accomplishment that we cannot really explain, we
can only experience it. We experience joy when we connect with higher
things. Like when we catch a glimpse of the purpose of a child born in
the Middle East two thousand years ago changing the world forever, joy
rises in our hearts like a morning mist allowing the first rays of the
sun to shine through.</p>
<p>Then, if we are able to follow the development of this child, born
into a tribe, as it felt the imprint of individuality in its soul, joy
rises within us. This joy is not only the result of our ability to see
what took place but also to recognize the freedom made available to
every single human being.</p>
<p>Joy awakens in us a sense of independence while at the same time
giving us the ability to make creative choices. An innate respect
awakens within us for every human being who, like us, has the power to
make choices. When we see this we also see our relationship to the Gods
who make choices to create and maintain this Universe. Accompanying this
joy is the deep sense of responsibility we have for each other and for
this world.</p>
<p>Joy is not something we express; it is a quiet inner activity that
shines from us to the extent that we can achieve it. We don’t need to
tell anyone we are experiencing this joy, they know, and they set about
trying to have the experience themselves.</p>
<p>When Rudolf Steiner was asked why there is so little happiness in
life when everyone just wants to be happy, he replied, “<em>Well, maybe
being happy is not our reason for being alive.”</em> He added that we
are alive to accomplish a particular task. We know we are accomplishing
our particular tasks when we hear the whispers of joy filling our
hearts.</p>
