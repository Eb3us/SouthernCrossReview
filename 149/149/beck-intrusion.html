<main>
<p class="intro">Corinne Jones' legs ached as she trudged through the cold evening
rain to the bus stop on Third Avenue. The poorly designed bus shelter
only partially shielded her from the slanting downpour. She waited like
a weary farm animal whose labor was done, yet the barn was still far
away, for the bus that would take her uptown and across 125<sup>th</sup>
street to Harlem. She held the bag of leftovers under her porous old
blue cloth coat in an effort to keep them dry for her granddaughter,
Sharina. The thought of that beautiful child helped her endure the life
eroding fatigue that was washing over her as relentlessly as the
rain.</p>
<p>After a twenty minute wait that seemed forever the bus finally
arrived. Corinne hauled herself up the steps, swiped her fare card
through the slot and looked for a seat. She started up the aisle and saw
Betty Ann, an older black woman who worked as a maid for the Swintons, a
wealthy white family who were friends of her employers. Shortly after
she went to work for the Pardees she met Betty Ann when they shared
duties at an open house party. Betty Ann hated her employers in
particular and whites in general. She tried to infect Corinne with her
prejudice and started to tell her how to steal from her employers.
Corinne stopped her abruptly and refused to have anything to do with her
after that. Over the years Betty Ann had forgotten what caused her
enmity, but she loathed Corinne and insulted her whenever they met. They
often took the same bus home at night and Betty Ann would greet her each
time: "You old bitch. Fuck you." And Corinne would respond: "You mean
old hag." The ritual concluded, they would ignore each other the rest of
the way.</p>
<p>Corinne said a silent prayer of thanks that she got a seat, because
she didn't know if she had the strength to stand all the way to her stop
at St. Nicholas Avenue. She took the bag of leftovers from under her
coat, made sure it wasn’t wet, then stared out the window into the
glistening city night without seeing anything. She remembered when she
first started working for the Pardees as a maid and Mrs. Pardee would
inspect the leftovers bag to insure that Corinne wasn’t taking
unauthorized cuts of meat. The degrading search after the humiliation of
being given leftover charity still pained her. She shook her head to
clear it of the unwelcome thoughts and focused on Sharina.</p>
<p>Corinne had been taking care of her granddaughter since she was
seven, when her father was killed in a drive-by shooting. The unfairness
of her son’s death was still an ache in her heart. Leshaun had been a
good boy, then a good man, raising his daughter after his wife died of
cancer. He was on his way home from work, just passing the corner where
the drug dealers distributed the poison that was destroying so many of
her people, when a car pulled up and gangbangers began firing. According
to the policeman who told Sharina about her father's death when she was
the only one he found at home, he died instantly. The police assumed
that Leshaun was there for a drug buy and remained skeptical of
Corinne's claim of his innocence, no matter how much she insisted that
her son didn't use drugs. The awful memories were beginning to overwhelm
her and she said a silent prayer that sent them away.</p>
<p>She sat there stolidly for a few minutes, as the bus rolled past the
luxurious shops and restaurants that mocked the economically challenged
who couldn't afford the prices of the new economy, or the old for that
matter. She had willed herself long ago not to want things that she
could never have and that way she was never tempted to steal. She didn't
know if this made her a good person, but it made her an honest one. She
had also learned to accept the unacceptable for the sake of her beloved
granddaughter. The bus passed 96<sup>th</sup> street and the shabbier
stores and buildings sagged drearily in the corrosive rain. Corinne
brooded about the last minute instructions she received from her
employer just as she was leaving. Mrs. Pardee told her in that false
friendly tone of equality that she always used with Corinne: "The family
will be going to Westhampton tomorrow morning, so you'll have to be here
early. We'll come back Sunday evening, and we'll drop you at
125<sup>th</sup> street where you catch your bus."</p>
<p>Corinne had assumed since it had been cold in early October that they
wouldn't be going to the house in Westhampton again until spring. The
Yankee weatherman betrayed her with a treacherous forecast of
temperature in the 70's. She hated going to Westhampton. She had to sit
in the front seat with the chauffer, Reggie, who listened to 'gangsta
rap' on his headset and never talked to her. Her only day off was
Sunday, so now that was lost. To make it worse she couldn't bring
Sharina, because she had a karate tournament on Saturday. The endless
demands of the weekend sent a shudder of dread through her. The Pardees
didn't bring the cook on weekends, so Corinne had to help in the kitchen
and clean up afterwards. Between the Pardees and their guests they
soiled more dishes, cups, glasses and silverware than an army battalion
just off field rations. And Reggie, who did the lawns and pool, would
never dream of helping. Her only consolation was that Sharina would
start college next September with a full scholarship. Once she was away
at school, maybe Corinne could think about another job.</p>
<p>The bus started up the long hill to Harlem. Sometimes she wished that
the hill was much higher, so they could look down on the rich folks
below. Maybe then if there were race riots the hooligans could roll
things down on the rich and not just destroy the poverty community. She
shook her head and sent the bad thoughts away and pictured her
granddaughter. Sharina was the light of her life, a wonderful girl who
bubbled with joy, who was bright, talented and an honor student bound
for Harvard and a better future. The bus turned on 125<sup>th</sup>
Street, stopped and some noisy black youths wearing red bandanas on
their heads swaggered on, shaking raindrops on the other passengers,
daring them to object. Corinne looked straight ahead when they tried to
meet people's eyes and they went to the back of the bus, boom box
blasting curses and anger.</p>
<p>Corinne knew about gang colors. Her daughter Tabitha had run with a
gang. Corinne had tried to stop her, but couldn't overcome the violent
gang allure that eclipsed her dull, demanding days of school. In a
desperate effort to stave off the inevitable, Corinne sent her to stay
with relatives in North Carolina. Run-ins with the law and
confrontations with the neighbors brought her back to Harlem, where she
was beyond control. Her boyfriend turned her onto drugs and when her
habit became too expensive he put her on the street as a prostitute, to
pay for the white powder of obliteration. Sometime between tricking and
shooting up, AIDS arrived and Tabitha slowly rotted away, decayed within
and without, giving the gift of death to anyone who entered her wasted
body. Then one day she didn't come home and was never heard from again.
Corinne never found out what happened to her. She said a silent prayer
for her lost daughter, pushed the stop signal and went to the rear exit
so she wouldn't have to see Betty Ann.</p>
<p>Just before she got off the bus, Corinne risked a glance at the gang
boys sprawled in the back, echoing the rap lyrics, yelling and cursing.
Their red cotton bandanas reminded her of the field hands picking cotton
who her mama had told her about. They were called handkerchief heads
because of the cloth they wore to protect them from the sun. She
couldn't help thinking that these violent boys were just as much slaves
as the darkies of the past they so despised, except their master wore a
different suit of greed. One of the boys noticed her staring at them.
"Watcha lookin at, ole black lady?" She turned away and scuttled off the
bus, afraid that they might come after her and hurt her. As the bus
drove away, the boy raised his middle finger at her, but she ignored it
and quickly walked home.</p>
<p>The climb up five flights of stairs was more tiring than usual, but
as she got to her door the image of her granddaughter raised her
flagging spirits. Sharina was there, safe, sitting at the kitchen table
doing her homework. Corinne’s usual fear for the girl's well-being
evaporated temporarily. "Hi, gramma. You look tired." The kiss and
loving hug rekindled her energy. "I’m all right. Mrs. Pardee told me
we're goin to Westhampton in the mornin an it just wore me down a bit."
"Why can’t that woman hire someone out there for the weekend? She
couldn't care less about your welfare." "There are worse employers than
Mrs. Pardee. At least she pays me for the extra day now." "It's not
fair, gramma. You don't get any benefits and if you get sick they won't
help. They're so selfish. Why are they always intruding in our lives?"
"It don't do no good to fret about them. I brought your dinner. Why
don't you eat and forget them." "I hate eating their leftovers." "I
know. But it's good food. Next year you'll be away at college and
this'll be over." "You'll still be working for them." "We’ll see. Once
you're taken care of I can do somethin else." "Oh gramma, you've done so
much for me." "You're a treasure, chile. Now eat while I go lie
down."</p>
<p>The warm glow of Sharina's appreciation revived her and instead of
going to bed she turned on the television set. It was the one month
anniversary of the World Trade Center disaster. She said a silent prayer
for all the people killed that terrible day. The news was mostly about
the bombing attacks on Afghanistan. After a humorous commercial that
didn't amuse her, the big story was the third case of anthrax in
Florida. It had become a criminal investigation, since they discovered
that the source was man made. All the talk of biological attack by
terrorists was scaring her and she hoped that the government would
capture or kill the terrorists before they killed more Americans. She
understood that the people in those Arab countries were poor and
oppressed, but they shouldn't be allowed to murder innocent people. Her
neighbor's husband died in the attack on the World Trade Center on
September 11<sup>th</sup>. He worked in the kitchen of that famous
restaurant that was so high up and he didn't come down. He never did
anything to Osama Bin Laden.</p>
<p>Sharina finished her homework and came in and sat with her. "What are
you watching, gramma?" "One of those blond haired ladies on CNN is
tellin us that we don't have to worry about anthrax. Now she's really
got me worried." "There's nothing much we can do tonight. Tomorrow I'll
ask Dr. Fairstone about it and he'll tell me what we should do. Now
let's talk about something else." Corinne nodded agreement. "I was just
thinkin about how I used to take you with me to Westhampton when you
were a little girl." "I always hated going there," Sharina said. "Those
Pardee kids were so stuck up that when their friends were visiting
they'd just ignore me, or order me around like a servant. But when they
didn't have anyone else to play with, they'd behave as if those other
humiliating things never happened. Sometimes I wished they drowned."</p>
<p>She looked at Corinne as if expecting her to be shocked, but she just
smiled sadly: "I know they didn’t treat you right, but I couldn't leave
you alone back here in Harlem. You were just too young. I didn’t like it
any more than you did. Those Pardee kids are as selfish and
inconsiderate as their parents. But I had no choice." "I understood that
even then, gramma. And it wasn't always awful. Sometimes Wesley behaved
all right when no one else was around. It was that Amelia who really got
me mad. One day she decided to play 'Gone With the Wind' and she wanted
me to be Mammy. When I refused she complained to her momma who told me I
was being uncooperative. I told her that it was racially degrading for
me to play Mammy, but I’d play Scarlet O'Hara if Amelia insisted on
playing." Corinne laughed. "I remember that. It was one of the few times
when Mrs. Pardee was at a loss for words. How old were you then?" "I was
eleven." "I was so proud of you when you said that."</p>
<p>Sharina smiled. "Thanks, gramma. Things got worse when I was thirteen
and my body started developing. Reggie was always watching me. Even
Mister Pardee looked at me. And Wesley was always trying to touch me
when we went swimming." "I saw that. I was so happy when Doctor
Fairstone got you that assistant counselor's job at the girls camp the
next summer." "Me, too. I wasn't going to let any of them near me and I
know it would have cost you your job if there was an incident." "We
would have managed, chile." "I know, gramma, but it would have been a
problem and I’m glad it worked out. When Dr. Fairstone hired me next
year as a part-time assistant after school, I started learning so much
about medicine that I decided to be a doctor. I’m so grateful to
him."</p>
<p>Sharina didn't want her grandmother to feel neglected because she
praised the doctor and said lovingly: "You’re the best gramma in the
whole world. Someday when I'm a successful doctor, I’m going to take
care of you. I'll buy you a beautiful house, and nice furniture, and
nice clothes…." "I don’t need those things, chile. I have you and the
lord." "But you’ve helped me with everything. You got me the job with
Dr. Fairstone and the job at Wendell's Funeral Parlor." "I'm still sorry
I did that. I don't know how you can work at that nasty place. The
thought of you handlin all those dead bodies makes my skin crawl." "It's
safe, gramma, and what I learn there will help me in medical school. Now
let's talk about something else. I want to do something wonderful for
you." "Well there is one thing." "What?" "When I die, I want to be
buried someplace special." "Oh, gramma, you’re going to live a long time
yet." "That may be, but that's what I want." "Then that's what you’ll
get." "You're an angel. Now give me a kiss and let's go to bed. It's
gettin late."</p>
<p>Sharina didn't think of their conversation again and her senior year
of high school sped by in a welter of activities. Between school, her
two part-time jobs, karate practice and her new boyfriend, Sharina was
too busy to spend much time with her grandmother. Soon graduation day
arrived and former president Bill Clinton, in a gesture to his Harlem
neighbors, was the guest of honor and handed out diplomas. Corinne
almost burst with pride when Sharina delivered the valedictory and
President Clinton shook her hand. Then Sharina was off to Harvard for
the early access pre-med studies program that would put superior
students on a fast track. Sharina's scholarship covered dorm, board,
books, fees and tuition, so Corinne didn't have to worry about how she'd
manage away from home. For the first time since the death of her son,
the burden of responsibility for her precious granddaughter was gone.
She could even start to think about what to do with her life.</p>
<p>Sharina wrote often for the first month or two, but when the first
semester started her workload was enormous and she added to it with a
part-time job in the anatomy lab maintaining the cadavers. She thrived
on the challenges and loved the sheltered enclave of the university. She
wrote Corinne that she had enough money to come home for Thanksgiving.
She took the train from Boston on November 21<sup>st</sup>, avoiding
flying like many Americans. She got home about 9:00 PM, unlocked the
door and found her beloved gramma lying on the floor. She screamed:
"Gramma," and rushed to her, but she was dead. Corinne's body was cold
and stiff, so Sharina knew she had been dead for a while. She gently
placed the lifeless head in her lap and cried silent tears that burned
her cheeks.</p>
<p>As soon as she was able to stop crying, she phoned Dr. Fairstone and
told him the sad news. He said he'd be there right away and the sound of
his kindly voice set her crying again. He got there in five minutes and
quickly examined Corinne. "She's been dead for about ten to twelve
hours." "My poor gramma. If only I was here for her. I might have gotten
her to the hospital in time." Dr. Fairstone shook his head. " It
wouldn't have helped. She had a massive coronary that killed her
instantly." "Did she suffer?" "No, dear. She didn't feel a thing." "Are
you sure?" "Yes." He covered Corinne with a blanket and turned to
Sharina: "What kind of arrangements do you want to make?" "I don't know.
I don’t have any money." He patted her arm reassuringly. "I'll have
Mr. Wendell take her to his funeral parlor and we'll work the details
out later."</p>
<p>Mr. Wendell agreed to pick up the body at 9:00 A.M. Dr. Fairstone
made sure that Sharina was all right and offered her a sedative. "I
don't need anything, thanks." "Then I'll see you in the morning. Call me
if you need me." Sharina sat there quietly for a while, then walked
through the apartment, idly touching some of her grandmother's things.
She noticed the red light flashing on the answering machine and
retrieved the first message.</p>
<p>"This is Mrs. Pardee, Corinne. I'm very disappointed that you didn't
come to work. We have so many preparations for Thanksgiving that I
really can't manage without you. Please call me." Sharina wanted to
scream, but controlled herself and listened to the second message. "I
don’t know where you are, Corinne, but it's very irresponsible of you to
leave me in the lurch like this. Call me at once." Sharina felt a blaze
of hate rush through her and she dug her nails into her palms until her
hands turned white.</p>
<p>It took Sharina a few minutes to bring herself under control, then
she played the third message. "I realize you just don't care what
happens to us. After all the years you worked for us, I expected a
little more consideration." The rage she felt was ice cold as she
reached for the phone and dialed the Pardee's number. When Mrs. Pardee
answered in that detached, haughty voice that always suggested tennis
whites, she said: "This is Sharina…." Before she could say anything else
Mrs. Pardee interrupted: "Where is that grandmother of yours. Doesn't
she know how important this holiday is?" Sharina took a deep breath. "My
grandmother is dead, Mrs. Pardee." "I really don’t appreciate your humor
at a time like this." "Listen to me, you spoiled, self-centered…." "What
did you call me?" "I told you she's dead. She died of a heart attack.
Now do you have anything to say?" There was a brief silence, then
Mrs. Pardee said: "Well that's too bad. I guess I'll just have to call a
temporary agency." Sharina slammed the phone down in disgust.</p>
<p>She didn't sleep at all that night. Every few hours she went into the
living room and looked at the face of the only person in the world who
loved her. Corinne looked older than she remembered, but more at peace,
as if the stress of her responsibilities was over. Sharina whispered
lovingly: "You were so good, gramma. I'm so sorry that I didn't have the
chance to do things for you." She cried for a while, then lay down to
rest. Her thoughts kept coming back to the telephone messages from
Mrs. Pardee and the infuriating phone call that followed. She knew what
the Pardees were like, sheltered by wealth, insulated from the economic
pressures that ordered the lives of the less privileged, and unaware of
the needs of others. It wasn't that she expected them to be moved by the
death of a black servant, which she now understood was only a mere
inconvenience to them. It outraged her that Mrs. Pardee couldn't
acknowledge that a person who worked for her for so many years had some
significance. She decided that she’d give Mrs. Pardee another chance and
call her in the morning, once gramma was at the funeral parlor.</p>
<p>Mr. Wendell came for Corinne in the morning and invited Sharina to
ride with him in the hearse. She declined and instead walked the few
blocks. She felt remote from the people around her who were going about
their business as if the best person in the whole world hadn’t left her.
She couldn't tell if the isolation she was feeling was from loss or
numbness, but she seemed to be moving invisibly through the life around
her. Dr. Fairstone and Mr. Wendell were waiting for her when she got to
the funeral parlor. Mr. Wendell led her into the Heavenly Rest Chapel.
"You just sit here and I'll bring your grandmother in." "You'll treat
her nicely, won't you Mr. Wendell?" "Yes, dear. She was my friend. Why
don't you think about what you want done with her remains." She turned
to Dr. Fairstone in despair: "I don't know what to do with gramma."
"There. There," he said. "We'll put our heads together and figure out
something."</p>
<p>She sat there in a daze without any sense of time passing until Mr.
Wendell wheeled in a gurney. On it was one of his showroom coffins that
contained her tiny gramma. She walked to the gleaming mahogany casket
and looked down at the face that would never smile lovingly at her
again. Tears gushed from her eyes and she silently vowed: 'I don't know
how, gramma, but I'll find some way to make your burial special.'
Dr. Fairstone waited patiently until she stopped crying: "We have to
talk about the burial now. Did Corinne have any insurance?" "No, sir."
"Does she have any family or friends who might help?" "I think we're the
only ones." "What about her employer?" "You mean the Pardees?" "I didn't
know their name." "Mrs. Pardee told me that it was very inconsiderate
for gramma to die at holiday time," Sharina said bitterly. "Perhaps
they'll help with the funeral expense." "I don't think I can count on
them for anything." "I'll contribute a coffin and the hearse to the
cemetery," Mr. Wendell said, "but I can't cover the expense for the plot
and headstone." "Thank you for your offer, but I don't have any money."
"What if we cremate her? I'll do it for free." "I couldn't do that to
her," Sharina said. "I'll call the Pardees again and ask for their
help."</p>
<p>She phoned Mrs. Pardee, who sounded impatient at being bothered. "My
gramma didn't have any insurance, Mrs. Pardee. I wonder if you can help
me with the funeral expenses?" There was a long silence. "I don't think
that will be possible." Sharina tried to contain her indignation. "She
worked for you for a long time. Don't you feel any sense of obligation?"
"We'll be happy to send flowers," Mrs. Pardee said coldly, "once you
tell us where the service will be held. That’s all we can do." "But I
don't have the money to bury her properly," Sharina confided. "I'm sure
you'll manage. There must be some place you can get help like the
welfare bureau, or the NAACP." Sharina felt like strangling the
ignorant, condescending woman. "You're some piece of work, Mrs. Pardee.
My gramma slaved for you for years and that's all you can say? You can
keep your stinking flowers." She hung up the phone without waiting for a
reply and pounded the wall in frustration, while tears of rage poured
from her eyes.</p>
<p>Dr. Fairstone and Mr. Wendell found her in the office sitting on the
floor, slumped against the wall, crying. "I guess they wouldn't help
you," Dr. Fairstone said gently. "We'll think of something, my dear. Why
don't you wash your face and meet us in the chapel." Sharina went to the
bathroom, rinsed with cold water and pulled herself together. When she
rejoined her friends they were discussing the funeral options.
"Mr. Wendell has outlined the most practical arrangements," Dr.
Fairstone said. "Cremation or burial at Potter’s Field." "What's that?"
"It's where indigents are buried in a cemetery on Staten Island,"
Mr. Wendell answered. Sharina was horrified. "I can't do that to my
gramma." Dr. Fairstone tried to reason with her. "I understand that this
isn't desirable, but there don't seem to be other choices." "I won't do
that to her. I promised her something special. Let me think about it."
"I have to get back to my patients. I'll come back when office hours are
over." "Thanks, Dr. Fairstone. I really appreciate your help." "I wish I
could stay with you, but my patients are worried about anthrax or other
biological attacks. I'll see you later." "I'll walk you to the door,"
Mr. Wendell said.</p>
<p>Sharina sat in the chapel, brooding about her lack of choices and
looking at the coffin that held her beloved gramma. She couldn't come up
with any solutions to the problem. Every time she tried to concentrate,
hateful images of the Pardees kept intruding. Mrs. Pardee's callous
indifference was ripping through her with stabs of rage. A cold fury
channeled her thoughts and helped focus her mind. She remembered a
Pardee family funeral that she went to when she was a child. Her gramma
was compelled to give up her Sunday and attend, and she took her along
because there was no one to leave her with. She vaguely recollected a
long ride to a Long Island cemetery that seemed like an enchanted
forest, with clumps of large old oak and maple trees that lined the
walks. She had asked wonderingly: "Who lives in those big stone houses,
gramma?" She understood now that her gramma had carefully considered her
answer: "Some people are put there by their families when they die."
"Will we go there when we die?" "No, chile. Only the rich people go
there." "Where will we go, gramma?" "We don't have to worry about that
for a long time."</p>
<p>The picture of her gramma's sweet, loving face when she said that
brought more tears to Sharina's eyes, but her mind was crystal clear.
Suddenly a wild idea flashed through her; 'I'll put gramma in the Pardee
family mausoleum.' At first it sounded crazy, but the more she
considered the idea, the more comforting it became. She basked in the
wave of pleasure that rolled over her as she imagined gramma resting in
the splendid family tomb of the rich Pardees. After a few moments, more
practical thoughts seeped in. How would she get gramma to the cemetery?
How would she get her into the mausoleum? Did she need a coffin? She had
never been in a mausoleum, so it was a place of mystery. Did the bodies
lie around in piles? On tables? In boxes? Frustration raced through her
for her ignorance. She tried to control her swirling emotions and
decided to ask Mr. Wendell about mausoleums, but not tell him about her
far-fetched idea right away.</p>
<p>Mr. Wendell was on the phone when she walked into his office and he
gestured to her to sit down. She fidgeted tensely as he wheedled someone
at the medical examiner's office about the interpretation of his
contract to inter John and Jane Doe bodies for the city. When business
was slow he was eager for the extra income from indigent funerals. If
business was good he didn't want to waste time on the low-fee jobs. His
special efforts to befriend the clerks who assigned the jobs included
cash, gifts and other incentives. He began to trust Sharina after she
had worked for him for a while and he kept few secrets of his day to day
operations from her. He made exaggerated funny faces for her benefit as
he talked and she managed a weak smile of appreciation for his efforts
to ease her sorrow. He finally hung up the phone, and shook his head.
"My mama would turn over in her grave if she heard me arguing all the
time about dead bodies. Hee. Hee."</p>
<p>She looked at him intently, considering how to present her wild idea,
but he made it easy. "Have you decided what to do about your grandmother
yet?" he asked in his professional voice of comfort. "I've thought about
it and I've come up with a plan that I want to tell you about, but
please don't interrupt me 'til I"m done. Okay?" "Sure. Go ahead." "I
considered the choices and couldn't accept them because I promised
gramma a special burial and at first I didn't know what to do because I
didn't have any money and I got madder and madder at the Pardees for not
caring about her and I remembered they had a big family mausoleum and I
decided I want to put gramma into their mausoleum without their knowing,
and…" "What?" "You said you wouldn't interrupt." "Where'd you get this
crazy notion?" "Can I finish?" "Yeah." "Well I need your help to do it."
"Girl, you’re outta your mind." "That's the only way I can think of to
do something special for her."</p>
<p>He stared at her strangely, then burst into laughter. "In all my
years in mortuary science that’s the craziest thing I ever heard." "Why?
Once she's in there no one will know. It’s just a matter of putting her
in there. You should know how to do that." "You want me to do it?" he
asked in amazement. "Who else? You're her friend. I'll help you. Nobody
else has to know." "Do you have any idea what you’re asking?" "Yes. If I
had another choice I'd do it." "What about Dr. Fairstone?" "I won't tell
him. He's a wonderful man, but he’s set in his ways and I don't think
he'd approve." "Are you telling me I’m not ethical?" "No, Mr. Wendell.
He's old and wouldn't understand. You're a smart businessman. You know
how complicated everything is." "You’re a cunning devil. You think some
flattery will get me to do it?" "I'm asking you as her friend." He got
up and paced behind his desk. "Let me think about it." A wave of
gratitude raced through her. She rushed to him and kissed him on the
cheek. "Thanks, Mr. Wendell. I knew you'd help." "I didn't agree yet.
Now be quiet and let me think."</p>
<p>He sat down at his desk and leaned his head on his hands. She waited
quietly until he asked: "Are you sure this is what you want to do?" "Do
you have a better idea?" "No." "Then this is what I want." "Let me tell
you what's involved. We gotta get the death certificate from
Dr. Fairstone and tell him you decided to cremate her. The next day we
go to… what's the name of their cemetery?" "I don’t know, but it's the
Pardee family mausoleum." "That's all right. I can get the information
on the internet. Then we drive there in a private car, hope one of my
batch of keys will open the mausoleum door, find a good shelf, put her
in, then get out without anyone noticing us." "That doesn't sound too
hard." He snorted. "Right. And what if we get caught?" "I'll take all
the blame." He shook his head. "You're as hard headed as your grandma."
Then he laughed loudly. "But I like the idea of double dipping. I'll do
it."</p>
<p>Now that she had help and a plan, a feeling of euphoria took over and
everything seemed dreamlike and remote, as if it were happening to
someone else. When Dr. Fairstone came back that evening she told him
that she had decided on cremation. He sat with her for a while and his
presence was comforting. She hugged him when he said good night and
thanked him for being a good friend. Mr. Wendell suggested that she go
home and sleep for a while, but she said she was too revved to leave.
She looked over his shoulder while he searched the net until he located
the cemetery. He explained to her that they couldn't put Corinne in a
coffin because they wouldn't be able to manage it by themselves and they
might be noticed if he brought extra help. He went to put Corinne in a
plastic body bag and Sharina said she could do everything else, but she
couldn't put her gramma in the bag. Mr. Wendell left her in the office
while he made the final preparations and she dozed off.</p>
<p>She woke up in the morning with that odd sense of detachment that
sometimes occurs when waking up in a strange place. Mr. Wendell brought
fresh coffee and a donut for her that she devoured voraciously. They
left the funeral parlor for gramma's last ride at 10:00 A.M. The traffic
was light and within a few minutes they were crossing the Tri-Borough
Bridge. The day was warm and clear and the sun glistened on the dirty
face of the East River, concealing the detritus and pollution bequeathed
to the waterways of America. She looked without seeing as they rolled
along the Long Island Expressway and barely noticed when they turned
into the cemetery. It took a few moments until it registered that they
had arrived. She looked around curiously and found that the fabulous
burial ground of memory was just another cemetery.</p>
<p>Mr. Wendell consulted a map of the cemetery that he had downloaded
from the net and drove straight to the Pardee mausoleum. No one paid any
attention to them. He got out of the car, walked to the massive metal
door with his large ring of keys, tried some and in a few moments he
swung the door open. He looked around carefully and made sure no one was
watching them. He went to the car, motioned her to come help him, then
opened the trunk and removed the body bag. They carried it into the
mausoleum and put it down on the stone floor. Mr. Wendell checked the
shelves and found one that contained Beatrice Pardee, 1882-1957. He
opened the decorative marble panel, then the wooden door. They picked up
the body bag and slid it behind Beatrice's coffin, where it couldn't be
seen. "If you want to say anything, do it quickly," Mr. Wendell said
urgently. "We need to get out of here without being discovered." She
stood there silently and finally whispered: "Goodbye, gramma. I love
you."</p>
<p>Mr. Wendell closed the shelf door and quickly replaced the marble
panel. He rushed her out the door, locked it, hurried them to the car,
then drove out of the cemetery. Once they were on the highway, he yelled
triumphantly: "Nobody saw us. Whatta ya think of that, kid?" "I don't
believe how easy it was." "It's like anything else in the world. If you
know what you're doing and go about it naturally, as if you belong,
nobody notices." "I'll never forget this, Mr. Wendell. If there's every
any way to repay you I will." "That's all right, girl. It was a rush
doing that. You don't owe me anything." For the rest of the ride he
babbled on, keyed up by his adventure and didn't notice her silence. She
sat there quietly, locked in memories of her beloved gramma. Just as
they got to the glittering bridge that led back to Harlem, she thought:
"I did it, gramma. I made your burial special. Now you'll rest in that
grand stone mansion for the dead with the Pardees and not have to clean
up after them. I hope you won't mind being there. It's the best I could
do."</p>
