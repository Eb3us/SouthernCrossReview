Ringgold began her painting career in the 1950s. Her early work is composed with flat figures and shapes.

Though she received a great deal of attention with these images, many of her early paintings focused on the underlying racism in everyday activities; which made sales difficult, and disquieted galleries and collectors.  These works were also politically based and reflected her experiences growing up during the Harlem Renaissance – themes which matured during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Movement">Civil Rights Movement</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminism">Women\'s movement</a>...

        "Author Judith von Halle writes an impressive and brave perspective on why the Coronavirus pandemic is happening to us at this time. She addresses the psychological aspects but focuses mostly on spiritual knowledge, spiritual reality, and “spiritual-science.” The term spiritual-science drew my curiosity. This 100-page book is a monograph that I would often pause in the reading so I could reflect on the somewhat radical ideas. Some readers will find certain insights a bridge too far, as I did at times, but most of it makes convincing sense and offers the reader a unique understanding of Covid-19. Haven’t we all asked, “Why is this happening now? What is really going on here with all this sickness, death, and widespread contagion?”",

        "We proceeded in thought to the place where the human being – who with normal consciousness can grasp the sense-world, which is the world that surrounds him – can feel himself related to the super-sensible, related to a being which corresponds to his own being. And we want to first develop this sensation before proceeding to the mysteries of the spiritual life, which we will do shortly.",

I have postponed those lectures and decided for now to dedicate Thursdays to the subject of cosmology, the evolution of the world, that is, the teaching about the inception of the world and the shaping of the human being within this world in a theosophical sense.",
        "I am aware that this involves the most difficult chapter of theosophical teaching, and I can inform you that several of our branches have decided not to even touch upon this chapter because it is too difficult. Nevertheless, I have decided to do so, because I believe that the indications I am able to give may be useful to many of you. Even though we cannot cover the subject completely at once, we can nevertheless receive indications that will serve to allow us to penetrate more deeply into the material later.",

Pero, al final, decidí no participar en la jornada y, en vez, escribir sobre lo que yo conozco de esa historia – no solamente la parte positiva e inspiradora, sino también la parte oscura...",
