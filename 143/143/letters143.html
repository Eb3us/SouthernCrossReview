<p>RE: <a href="https://southerncrossreview.org/143/engelhardt-deja-vu.html">Déjà
Vu All Over Again</a> by Tom Engelhardt</p>
<p>Tom Engelhardt is one of the voices I always listened to and still
do. In this article, however, he forgot mentioning one important fact.
That is the nuclear first strike doctrine of the US hidden behind the
words: ‘The United States has refused to adopt a no first use policy’,
meaning that the first strike doctrine has been and is the predominant
American military doctrine.</p>
<p> In consequence, this means that Russia has lived all the years of
confrontation and one-sided economic warfare after the fall of the
Soviet Union with the fear that they could at any time, while the US had
a technological advantage, become the victims of an American attack.
When Putin put his nuclear forces on high alert, he just drew even with
what was already standard policy in the US.</p>
<p> In addition to this, it were the US and NATO who first broke
international law by bombing Yugoslavian cities, creating Kosovo with
force (and without the follow-up of a promised plebiscite), invading
Iraq and bombing Libya without a valid UN mandate while breaking their
pledge not to enlarge NATO towards the Russian border. In addition, to
be valid, their newly invented doctrine R2P, ‘responsibility to
protect’, cannot be applied and accepted by only one partner in the
game.</p>
<p>International law and political pledges have since become empty words
in an ideological dit for dat. Anyone, looking clear minded at the
origin of Russia’s military adventure will have to start here and not at
the date when Russia’s soldiers crossed their borders. Independent of
present opinions, it is this which will be read in future history
books.</p>

<p>Dear Southern Cross,</p>
<p>Certainly losing the Amazon forest would have a very negative impact
on human life around the world. Europeans travelled to the then new
world to escape the effects of deforestation in Europe. I dare say
climates do alter but sadly those who wish to prove that don't provide
useful evidence to support their claims. And now I find their is a big
question mark over the ability to detonate in a flash a whole day's
energy from a nuclear power station.</p>

Cosmology-2</a> by Rudolf Steiner</p>
<p>Thank you for covering these lectures. I find it helpful - it took me
a long time to read Blavatsky's book : the language was so difficult to
grasp. But already I am put at ease and find what RS talks about more
clear.</p>

Blues</a> by Frank Thomas Smith</p>
<p>Right on all accounts. Imagine a happy face emoji. So sorry I can’t
read everything you bring forth; the world is in great turmoil and I
feel spread out to encompass all, whether I understand it or not. Love
and hugs from me, and thanks for updates. Kendall Weaver</p>
<p style="text-align:center">*</p>
<p>Love it Frank, love it!</p>
<p>The beauty of rhyming verse confronting our mortality works for
me.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

<p>Good one! Needs a bitter-sweet guitar riff.</p>

<p>RE: <a href="https://southerncrossreview.org/143/adrian-ubi.html">Way to the
Universal Basic Income</a> by Frank Thomas Smith</p>
<p>I really loved your piece on Adrian's Way. Yes, by all means, let's
fight for the UBI Steiner's way. The donation part and the part on the
downgrading of the value are essential.</p>
<p>Warm regards from Spain,</p>
