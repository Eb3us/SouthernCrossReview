<h4>I.Introduction</h4>
<p class="intro">This paper will examine Jesus’ genealogies in Matthew and Luke from
the perspective of a transracially adopted bi-racial person. It will
argue that the two genealogies refer to two different people and that
the identities of the two children are transculturally significant. This
paper will also be concerned with knowledge and what we allow in respect
of gathering information of the kind that situates us in the world so
that we achieve our own perspective upon it and upon our existence. The
perspective adopted here will presume a reincarnational anthropology
that contextualizes the significance of bloodline and biological
inheritance. Jesus Christ will be shown to be a complicated person from
the perspective of his origins and to have an identity not defined from
bloodline.</p>
<h4>II.Theology as Anthropology</h4>
<p>Let us offer a basis for pursuing a Christology within an
anthropological context. The recent experience of women may help make
this clearer.  </p>
<p>One concrete and practical question has been raised as to Jesus’
maleness in respect of salvation as it relates to women. <a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> A
woman with more at stake in the reply than a man might ask, if what is
not assumed is not saved, then is a woman saved? This question is
historically young in that for millennia it was common sense that women
and men were equally saved by Christ’s salvific work. The question
presses more needfully as one inquires regarding a theology of
ordination to the priesthood. Can a woman become a priest? Many will
argue that a woman cannot. One reason given is that the male is the
alter christos and therefore in his body the priest represents Christ.
In this theology, the sex of the physical body is significant and
essential. In respect of the earlier question, does this thinking imply
that the salvation he offers extend only to men? Conversely, does a
salvation offered to both men and women have any implications for
ordination? What we say theologically, that Christ imparts salvation,
therefore relates to certain anthropology and vice versa.</p>
<p>On a more ethereal level, Karl Rahner asks how a theological detail
such as angels might be anthropologically considered.<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> He
first observes that a modern person looking into the “so-called
revelation” of angels may be lead to conclude in support of his or her
skepticism that angels “drifted into the minds of Old Testament
theologians from their cultural and religious environment” and that what
angels have to do with him or her is unimportant since their presence in
scripture seems little more than an accident of history. Rahner
re-frames the question, “where in [a person’s] theological understanding
of himself is there an area which might be occupied by an angelology?”
In other words, “what is really expressed in revelation is not the
existence and nature of angels as such at all, but [humanity’s]
relationship with them. Angels are assumed as given.” Angels are part of
the cosmos and humans exist in relationship with them. Human beings are
changed without angels in the cosmic ecosystem. They are part of
anthropology.</p>
<p>There is another way to see the relationship between theology or
Christology and anthropology. All theological assertions are
simultaneously about humanity.3 Because salvation is the object in all
scriptural revelation, all theology is “essentially salvation theology,”
and therefore, all theological inquiries are simultaneously inquiries to
humanity’s “saving receptivity for” the theological object, the proffer
of salvation from God. Therefore there will always be the tendency and
requirement to advance explanations in order to take theology from the
merely theoretical or abstract. The “saving receptivity…must be
reflected upon with reference to the concrete object concerned, which is
only theologically relevant as a result of and for the purpose of this
receptiveness for salvation [his emphasis]. The object also to some
extent lays down the conditions for such receptiveness.”<a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>
This paper will point to concretizing this receptiveness in respect of
Jesus’ humanity.</p>
<p>Anthropology is fundamental with respect to Christology and therefore
requires detailing, even though such detail will leave much unsaid.</p>
<h4>III.Anthropological presumptions</h4>
<p>We are presuming a reincarnational view of human beings which is
contrary to the view established in the Christian west. The principle
reason for the denial of reincarnation is that it conflicts with the
doctrine of the resurrection of the body. Countering this is the fact
that the insight regarding resurrection of the body was relatively young
within Judaism before Christ, not much more than one hundred fifty
years.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> Also, later Christian insights about
it are based upon one known instance. In twenty-centuries there has been
relatively little theoretical reflection about it, perhaps the most
elegant, simple and often referred to is still Paul’s dicta about
physical and spiritual bodies.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> In addition, the
relationship between reincarnation and resurrection was not a concern of
the New Testament.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> It is also difficult to see that if
one were wrong about reincarnation that it would have any necessary
bearing on our Christian life which already allows life and salvation
without reference to it. In that respect it would fall into the category
of beliefs like purgatory which is not necessary for salvation but not
harmful. On the affirmative side, a reason to accept reincarnation is
the threefold anthropology of body, soul and spirit. This tripartite
anthropology was commonplace in the west through the New Testament
period. The spirit is eternal and is what has converse with God.<a
href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> The position is coherent in respect
of human ontogeny, without which reduces to materialism. It is coherent
in respect of transcendental anthropology which holds that humanity is
borderless mystery.Also, it appears reasonable in that it has been
testified to in many cultures through many ages; as well as being
supported by practical testimony in regard to the Bodhisattva of
Compassion, the Dalai Lama of Tibet. In respect of origin, the human
being need not be thought of merely appearing once out of a mother’s
womb, but possesses an uncharted history with a parallel future.</p>
<p>Human life on earth is characterized by a maturational process
through which develops a sense of identity, self-hood and otherness.
One’s identity is related to the past but not determined by it. This
relationship needs to be examined. In the present age, mature life is
characterized by human to human and human to nature relationships. To
say that one lives in relationship with angels or spiritual beings of
any sort is formally allowed, because God is a spiritual being, but it
is philosophically problematic. A turning of some sort, a metanoia, may
be required during which a person actively reconsiders his identity and
the nature of the world. The requirement appears as an insight and
promise. Humanity is capable of bringing forth something new. As persons
approach death, self-consciousness, consciousness of existence and the
world may intensify. Upon dying persons proceed in some mysterious way
that is not obvious to everyone.</p>
<p>In respect of cosmic evolution, humanity is a vital part. It
continues to become evident that theology should be concerned with
evolutionary thought. In this paper it is assumed that cosmic evolution
has been active during which the cosmos has changed. This cosmic
evolution may also be noted to a relative degree in the communications
of history through the present, approximately three thousand years. The
powers and capacities that humanity possesses, such as sight, hearing,
rational thought, memory and so forth, are evolved and were not always
present as they are today. Humanity has gained and lost capacities.
Jesus Christ, human and divine, has a pivotal relationship to cosmic
evolution.</p>
<p>Before turning to the specifically christological focus there is one
more contextual feature to introduce.</p>
<h4>IV.Rudolf Steiner and Anthroposophy</h4>
<p>Rudolf Steiner was the initiate who provides the claim regarding the
two Jesus children. Steiner was born in Kraljevec, Hungary February 27,
1861 and died at Dornach, Switzerland, March 30, 1925. He was trained in
the natural sciences but his doctorate concentrated on Fichte’s
epistemology. During his late twenties and early thirties he was the
editor of Goethe’s scientific writings for German National Literature.
His life work may be divided into the periods before and after he turned
forty. In the earlier period he was not explicit about being an
occultist. He writes, “gently and gradually I led over into esoteric
paths.”<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> After forty one may “appear
publically as a teacher of occultism.”<a href="#fn9"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>
Central to his work was science. He writes, “No one would be able to
say: this occultist speaks about the spiritual world because he does not
know the philosophical and scientific achievements of the age.”<a
href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> From his work various movements,
including the Anthroposophical Society, took root and sprouted.<a
href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> For example, the Camphill
Communities serve person with learning disabilities, mental health
problems and other special needs.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> Waldorf Schools
provide education for children around the world with over 900 schools on
five continents.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> Biodynamic farming initiatives
exist around the world.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> The Christian Community is a
movement for Christian renewal formed with the help of Friedrich
Rittelmeyer, a Lutheran pastor. There are Christian Community
congregations around the world.</p>
<p>One thing that set Steiner apart from many of his contemporaries was
a natural ability to perceive things beyond ordinary sense perception.
For example, when he was eight he tells the story of encountering an
apparition of a recently deceased relative.</p>
<p>That the spiritual world is a reality was as certain to me as the
reality of the physical. But I needed some kind of justification for
this assumption. I wanted to prove to myself that it is no more an
illusion to experience the spiritual world than it is to experience the
physical. In regard to geometry I could say that one is privileged to
know something which the soul experiences solely through its own power;
this, I felt, justified me in speaking about the spiritual I
experienced, just as I spoke about the physical. And I did speak of it
that way. My mental pictures were of two kinds; I differentiated between
things that were ‘seen’ and things that were ‘not seen.’ This, though as
yet undefined, played an important role in my inner life even before my
eighth year.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>This gift is what set him on a course of becoming an occultist. It
should probably be said that gifts of this sort are not completely
uncommon.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> The degree of his gift was uncommon
but so was the depth of his desire to relate these perceptions within an
Idealist philosophical system and in the context of the material
scientific system that then existed. He held that spiritual gifts must
be contextualized by taking account of the world as it has become.
Revelations from the spiritual world must address that reality.
Spiritual life is a discipline that should provide practical wisdom from
above.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>What is relevant in the work of Steiner to Christology is compactly
expressed in his Autobiographical Sketch where he discusses the
Theosophical Society of which he had been the general secretary of the
Berlin chapter:</p>
<p>Continued successful development [of the Theosophical Society] in the
Western countries is dependent on how far it proves able to assimilate
the principle of Western initiation. For Eastern initiations must, of
necessity, leave untouched the Christ-principle as the central cosmic
factor of evolution. Yet without this principle the Theosophical
movement must remain without any decisive effect on Western culture,
which has the life of Christ as its point of origin. In the West, the
revelations of Oriental initiation would have to live as a mere
sectarian alongside the living culture. Their only hope of affecting
evolution would be if they could eradicate the Christ-principle from
Western Culture. This, however, would be identical with extinguishing
the essential meaning of the earth, which lies in the knowledge and
realization of the intentions of the living Christ.<a href="#fn18"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>As one can see, for Steiner, Christ is alive and the central agent in
the evolution of the earth. This will be a Christology that is cosmic,
evolutionary and contextual in respect of its self-conscious western
commitments. Methodologically his Christology begins with spiritual
perception and in that way is an ascending Christology, though in a
different manner than it is usually meant. Ascending Christology usually
begins from historical documents and archeological data. In Steiner’s
turn, the historical Jesus is knowable and apprehensible through a
seer’s ability to read the “Akashic record”. A reader of the Akasha is
reading the memory of world and in this way can work from below to form
a christology.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> The method works in making concrete
claims.</p>
<p>For example, Steiner disclosed that there were in fact two Jesus
children.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> These two children had two
different sets of parents, both named Mary and Joseph; one family who
lived in Nazareth and the other who lived in Bethlehem. In one case, the
father received visions anticipating the child and in the other case it
was the mother Mary. One child has an interior relation to Zoroaster
(=Zarathustra) and the other to the Buddha and who was “once born.” The
difference between the children is indicated in various ways by the two
respective infancy narratives in Matthew and Luke. That the two infancy
narratives were problematic was noted almost as soon as they were
compared with one another.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> Eusebius, for example,
explains that there were two different Josephs, one descended from Jacob
(cf. Matt) and the other from Heli (cf. Luke); one was the actual father
and the other the legal.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> With all this in mind
we turn to the genealogies of Jesus.</p>
<h4>IV.The genealogies of Jesus in Matthew and Luke</h4>
<p>Genealogy is a popular hobby these days. It is one of the ways that
people understand themselves. Stories about parents, aunts and uncles,
help explain why a person looks or moves the way he does. Many adopted
persons have the tie to their past severed either through court action
or bureaucratic procedures. This hiatus may negatively affect the
adoptee and their issue with regard to genetically inheritable
conditions. Lack of this fundamental information propels the movement
for equal access to birth records.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>In the ancient world it was commonplace knowledge that a person’s
origins disclose something about them. Scripture attests to this when
John’s Gospel offers “we do not know where he comes from” as evidence of
dubiousness as to Jesus’ identity.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> Paul offers his bona
fides by citing that he was an “Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, a
member of the tribe of Benjamin.”<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> The Old Testament
contains many genealogies because lineage was a basic foundation of the
social order.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> In post-exilic Israel one’s ability
to establish a lineage and the purity of bloodline was a basis for a
social caste system headed by Priests, Levites and Israelites followed
by the lower classes. The bottom castes, depending on the system,
included foundlings, freed slaves or hermaphrodites. The upper classes’
lineage, especially the Priests’, was carefully watched, as were
potential wives, through the lens of the “ancient [genealogical]
tables.”<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> These tables may or may not have
been written, but for persons who were not priests there were probably
only oral histories. As important as lineage was, there was an exception
to its careful and detailed rules of precedence.</p>
<p>A priest precedes a Levite, a Levite an Israelite, an Israelite a
bastard, a bastard a Nathin; a Nathin a proselyte, and a proselyte a
freed slave. This applies when they all are [otherwise] equal; but if a
bastard is learned in the Law and a High Priest is ignorant of the Law,
the bastard that is learned in the Law precedes the High Priest that is
ignorant of the Law.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>Learning the Law trumps bloodline. There was another concern that
bloodlines get mixed up and that this will one day make it hard to
identify who is who, only Elijah can decide.</p>
<p>R. Johanan [A.D. 75] said: By the Temple! It is in our power [to
reveal the families of impure birth in Palestine]; but what shall I do
seeing that the greatest men of our time are mixed up therein…Once a
family becomes mixed up, it remains so…Such as these Elijah will come to
declare unclean or clean, to expel and to admit.<a href="#fn29"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>These examples indicate that society was somewhat practical in
respect of bloodline. It is not absolute, it is not solely
determinative.</p>
<p>With respect to the Matthean and Lukan nativity stories, including
the genealogies, it seems commonplace to minimize their importance, as
N.T. Wright does, or to explain them in such a way that their facticity
is negated, as we see in Borg. This is a natural enough conclusion since
it is hard to see how they can refer to only one person. Wright uses an
argument to dismiss them in that they are not an essential part of the
gospel as would be identified by Paul in, for example, 1 Cor. 15:3-10.<a
href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a> Borg argues that they are literary
creations but not historically accurate.<a href="#fn31"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a>
In what sense then are the genealogies significant? If we determine that
they signify two separate persons, they may help advance an
understanding of the humanity of Jesus.</p>
<p>Curious in both the Matthean and Lukan genealogies is a wealth of
detail that does not seem to serve much purpose, or that serves a
purpose that seems to harm Jesus’ pedigree. For an example of the
latter, Matthew incorporates without qualm Tamar, Rahab, Ruth and ‘the
wife of Uriah’ in his genealogy as well as the later King Jechoniah. The
Sadducees sought to establish another basis for the kingship than
through David and found a polemic to challenge such a pedigree via the
presence of gentiles in the Davidic line, namely Tamar, Ruth and
Bathsheba.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a> The fact that who one married was
very important in Judea in Jesus’ day lent weight to these concerns for
lineage, a weight not felt so strongly today. Another concern with
Bathsheba, who is called in Matthew’s genealogy the “wife of Uriah,” was
an ever present reminder of David’s murder of Uriah.<a href="#fn33"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a>
That murder remained a blemish on David and was felt so even in the
intertestamental period.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref34" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a> Compounding difficulty
in the genealogy is Rahab who, like the other women, is a non-Israelite
but had never figured in rabbinic thought as part of the Davidic
lineage.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a> As odd a choice as she is for
inclusion in the genealogy, there was a tradition about Rahab [c. 80-120
A.D.] that she was an ancestor of priestly prophets:</p>
<p>Rahab the harlot who was an innkeeper. Eight priests and eight
prophets descended from her! They are: Jeremiah, Hilkiah, Seraiah,
Machsaiah, Baruch, Meraiah, Hanamel, and Shallum. Also Hulda the
prophetess was a descendant of Rahab. Now if she, who came from a people
of whom it is said: ‘Thou shalt not leave alive any soul,’ because she
drew near [to God], God drew her near [to himself], much more so with
Israel.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>Perhaps this inclusion helped Matthew’s message in the community of
which he was a part for a reason similar to this midrash: testimony to
God’s mercy.</p>
<p>If we accept this as sufficient reason for including this woman,
there remains the difficult fact of Jeremiah’s curse of Jechoniah (Jer.
22:24-30) that would seem to preclude all possibility of fruitful issue
in that line. That this was seriously considered a problem is noted by
Eusebius (ca. 300 CE) who held that Luke had heard the controversies
surrounding Jechoniah’s inclusion and created an alternate genealogy to
exclude him.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a> Notwithstanding Eusebius’ late
date, all of these were established lines of concern in pre-Christian
rabbinic<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a> and Christian thought, and stood in
the way of Pharisaic Judaism which realized that it must somehow
overlook or explain these facts away if it were to continue along
coherent lines, with the exception of Rahab. Matthew’s use of these
names reflects very deliberate intentions. It is unlikely that Matthew
wanted to strengthen an association with Pharisaic party, but perhaps
wanted to reach out to the pious Judeans who opposed the rabbis of
Jamnia, descendants of the Sadducees who may have been geographic
neighbors to him.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a> Strengthening ties with the
Pharisees works against the overall rhetoric of the gospel itself,
though appealing to some among them would make sense in a community in
which there was more than one school of Judaism present.<a href="#fn40"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40" role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a>
The so-called index of discontinuity says “historicity is inferred only
when a Jesuanic tradition is discontinuous with both the tendencies of
the community that transmitted it and the Jewish world within which
Jesus lived and taught.”<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref41" role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a> This principle would
suggest that the genealogy is true or intended as such. The genealogy
presented problems in the Jewish world and the community Matthew wrote
for which was largely Jewish.</p>
<p>The alternative theory found the Messiah’s lineage through Levi, in a
priestly line that went through Nathan, a brother of Solomon.<a
href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a> If Matthew is presenting something
true about Jesus’ genealogy, what are we to make of the Lukan tradition
which clearly contradicts it? Johnson makes the case that Luke was aware
of a “somewhat esoteric Jewish haggadah: Luke’s rejection of the royal
line in favor of Nathan, son of David, is most probably a reflection of
a Jewish tradition that identified this Nathan with the prophet.”<a
href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a> In other words, Luke’s genealogy
also expresses substantive information that had been discussed widely,
albeit in esoteric circles, in the period leading up to and following
Jesus’ life. This does not make particular sense for Luke’s audience
which may have been Hellenized Jews and gentiles. Perhaps he was
providing a olemical basis for Jesus not being a threat to the
social-political order: he was not really a king. Johnson notes that the
contradictions between the two genealogies make them incommensurable.<a
href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a> He concludes that neither of them
can be accurate genealogies. In the end, the significance Johnson finds
for these complex genealogies, carefully crafted and products of a great
deal of controversy and thought, is that they are both a work of art.
They are indeed a work of art and profound intelligence; yet, like the
rest of the gospels, the genealogies are a disclosure of things which
because of inherent unlikeliness are presumed impossible. Both present
such an odd and difficult collection of information that is highly
esoteric, that is attested in documents, that individually and mutually
considered serve to weaken their credibility at the time of their
writing and within their respective communities, lend weight to their
being very much intended and to be taken seriously as separate
genealogies.  </p>
<h4>V.The Two Children Become One</h4>
<p>Marcus Borg says that “how we see Jesus is to a large extent the
product of the lenses through which we see him.”<a href="#fn45"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45" role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a>
The first of four lenses that he identifies is foundational, “the modern
study of Jesus” which means that the gospels are the product of a
developing tradition, containing “history remembered and history
metaphorized.” The second lens is the study of ancient Judaism; the
third is an interdisciplinary study of Jesus and Christian origins and
the fourth is a cross-cultural study of religion.<a href="#fn46"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46" role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a>
The fifth lens added here is the one of Anthroposophy which is properly
subject to examination and criticism as his four. Selecting this lens is
reasonable in that Anthroposophy represents a living esoteric stream and
the fact that esotericism was still a living part of the Hellenic and
Judaic world in Jesus’ day. One of the esoteric communities of that day
was Essene which may have evolved into an Ebionite sect. Matthew may
well have been related to the Essenes.<a href="#fn47"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47" role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a>
The approach here will be to look for documentary support for the theory
presented by Steiner.</p>
<p>According to Steiner’s reading of the Akasha, the Jesus child
referred to in Matthew’s gospel, who was related to David’s line through
Solomon, was a reincarnation of Zoroaster (Golden star). This child will
die before reaching maturity but will profoundly affect the life of the
other child whose birth was described by Luke. Zoroaster was the
pre-historic figure who inaugurated the Persian culture. Respecting
literary indications, Oscar Cullman describes an Ebionite tradition of
the “True Prophet”, in which may be heard an echo of Zoroaster’s course
through world history, “Since the creation of the world, the True
Prophet hastens through the centuries, changing his name and form of
appearance. He incarnated himself again and again…Jesus is the true
incarnation of this Prophet.”<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref48" role="doc-noteref"><sup>48</sup></a> Zoroastrian scholar
James Moulton comments in respect of the gifts of the Magi, in
particular the frankincense and myrrh, “the narrative might have been
composed by a Magus for the accuracy with which it portrays Magian
ideas.”<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>49</sup></a> Moulton also discusses the Fravashi
which in relation to the birth of Zoroaster is described, “…the Glory
descending from the eternal light to enter the house where [his] mother
is to be born, uniting with her until at the age of fifteen she brings
forth her son.” <a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>50</sup></a> In respect of Solomon, we will also
mention the importance to the Essene community of the Zadokite
priesthood.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>51</sup></a> Zadok was the priest named
alongside Abiathar, a levitical priest. Zadok’s origins are obscure in
that there is a tradition that he was chief priest of Jebusite
Jerusalem, before the city was taken by David.<a href="#fn52"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52" role="doc-noteref"><sup>52</sup></a>
The Zadokite priesthood was a thorn in the side of the Levitic in that
the Zadokites were pluralist with regard to other religions.<a
href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>53</sup></a> An indication of Zakok’s closeness
to Solomon is that upon Solomon’s accession, Zakok banished Abiathar.<a
href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>54</sup></a> The Essenes, who were reviving the
Zadokite priesthood, may have preserved an insight in respect of Zadok’s
relationship to Solomon for the history of Israel and especially in
respect of Solomon’s relationship to the royal Messiah. This close
feeling for Solomon, revived by the Zadokite priesthood, compounded by
Matthew’s possible locus for writing in the NE area of Syria near Edessa
where there was “much Persian influence” works to bring Zoroaster up
from the utter darkness of impossibility into a sort of glimmer of
possibility – allowing, of course, the hypothesis of an Akashic
reading.</p>
<p>There are no historical associations, coincidences and co-locations
that can prove<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>55</sup></a> that this Jesus child was indeed
Zoroaster’s incarnation. Yet, it may be seriously wondered who chose to
wonder it.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>56</sup></a> Reasonable questions may arise from
a contemporary esoteric stream.</p>
<p>With respect of the Lukan tradition, we have found the genealogy to
be a product of “a somewhat esoteric Jewish haggadah.” The Nathan child,
according to Steiner, was significant in that he had never before been
born and that the Nirmanakaya, the Buddha’s astral body, also called the
body of transformations, worked in the angelic hosts who proclaimed
Jesus’ birth to the shepherds and later into the astral body of the
Nathan Jesus.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>57</sup></a> In the respect of incarnations the
Nathan child was unlike any human being in that he never experienced the
effects of the fall.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>58</sup></a> This is the manner in which Jesus
is said to be sinless.</p>
<p>One question that must be burning is what happens to the two
children. The simple answer is that the two become one, leaving behind
one child, the Solomon child who, as said above, dies prematurely. Let
it suffice for now to think such a thing is possible without
understanding how and let us turn instead to a cross cultural study of
religion. An Iranian legend comes to light about two becoming one in the
Saoshyant, the savior.</p>
<p>The thing against which the Destructive Spirit struggles most
violently is the coming together in full force of the dignities of
Kingship and the Good Religion in one person, because such a conjunction
must destroy him. For if the highest power of the dignity of Kingship
had been joined to the highest power of the dignity of the Good Religion
in Jamshid, or if the highest power of the dignity of Kingship as it
existed in Jamshid had been joined to the highest dignity of the Good
Religion in Zarathustra, then the Destructive Spirit would have met with
swift destruction, creation would have escaped from the Aggressor, and
the desired Rehabilitation would have been brought about in the two
worlds….When these two dignities meet in one man, then will the
Aggressor be completely vanquished and creation saved and purged; from
this the final Rehabilitation proceeds. The Good Religion reveals that
these two dignities will meet together in the Saoshyant.<a href="#fn59"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<p>According to Welburn, the sense of “dignity” is as an aura of light,
the glory (khvarnah) seen around a sacred person. Welburn also says that
this Zoroastrian savior “deeply influenced the esoteric thought of the
Essenes concerning the two Messiahs, the Priest and King, and the union
of both in a single overwhelming figure.”<a href="#fn60"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>60</sup></a></p>
<p>In Gnostic materials with a post-Christian date we find Justinius’s
Baruch. Baruch is the name of an angelic being who is identified with
Zarathustra.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>61</sup></a> What happens is recounted by
Hippolytus,</p>
<p>Finally, however, in the days of Herod the king, Baruch is
dispatched, being sent down once more by Elohim; and coming to Nazareth,
he found Jesus, son of Joseph and Mary, a child of twelve years, feeding
sheep. And he announces to him all things from the beginning, whatsoever
had been done by Edem and Elohim, and whatsoever would be likely to take
place hereafter, and spoke the following words: All the prophets
anterior to you have been enticed. Put forth an effort, therefore,
Jesus, Son of man, not to be allured, but preach this word unto men, and
carry back tidings to them of things pertaining to the Father, and
things pertaining to the Good One, and ascend to the Good One, and sit
there with Elohim, Father of us all. And Jesus was obedient unto the
angel, saying that, I shall do all things, Lord, and proceeded to
preach.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>62</sup></a></p>
<p>The Jesus child here referred to is the Nathan child, indicated by
his “feeding sheep,” and the event alluded to pictorially, his
proceeding to preach, corresponds to the twelve year old Jesus (Luke
2:42-52) found by his parents in the Temple “sitting among the teachers,
listening to them and asking them questions.”This may be read as two
becoming one. After this “angelic” association with the Nathan child
something new begins for the Lukan child. For Zoroaster’s “glory”
(khvarnah) something new begins as well, though for the Solomon child
there comes an end. What this exchange means for humanity remains to be
seen, but a dramatic cosmic plan is imagined in these preparatory events
which have yet to discuss how this relates to God as such.</p>
<p>After raising these questions, this paper will skip ahead to discuss
new things in respect of the new creation and to Christology.</p>
<h4>VI.Old and New Humanity</h4>
<p>Worldviews are not something fixed and determined unless we do
nothing to affect them. Marcus Borg tells an interesting story about the
modern worldview which he says is basically one of “matter and energy,
space and time; and it sees the world as a closed system of cause and
effect.”<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>63</sup></a></p>
<p>This worldview has very much affected the modern study of Jesus and
the Bible. Not all scholars operate within it, but it has been the
majority mindset of the modern academy. When we try to see Jesus within
this framework, it radically reduces what we will take seriously. There
is much that we will miss, including the centrality of God for Jesus. We
focus instead on what makes sense within our way of seeing.</p>
<p>So it was for me. There was a prolonged period in my life when the
modern worldview functioned in my mind as the final arbiter of what can
be taken seriously. The process was gradual. Raised as a Christian in
the middle of this century, I grew up with both a religious and a
secular worldview. By early adolescence, the secular worldview had begun
to cause problems for my religious worldview. By my late teens and
twenties, the problems had become acute. Indeed, the modern worldview
had essentially crowded out the religious worldview.</p>
<p>But I now see things differently. In my thirties, I became aware of
how uncritically, unconsciously, and completely I had accepted the
modern worldview. I saw that most cultures throughout human history have
seen things differently. I realized that there are well-authenticated
experiences that radically transcend what the modern worldview can
accommodate. I became aware that the modern worldview is itself a
relative cultural construction, the product of a particular era in human
intellectual history. Though it is still dominant in Western culture, I
am confident that the time is soon coming when it will seem as archaic
and quaint as the Ptolomaic worldview.<a href="#fn64"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>64</sup></a></p>
<p>It may be that the new worldview that is developing is
Anthroposophic. Or it may be a firmer version of the matter and energy,
cause and effect, religious and secular view; or some other.<a
href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>65</sup></a> Whichever worldview comes to the
fore, it will be produced in the human mind. How consciously humanity
considers what it perceives and what rules it applies to its thinking
will work in producing the future worldview.</p>
<p>The two major propositions about the two Jesus children, one being
related to Zoroaster and the other a unique incarnation in which the
Buddha’s Nirmanakaya worked for a time, which are frankly startling,
especially in relation to centuries of settled belief. It will also
stretch the mind that one child can work within the personality, or as
the personality, in the life of another person. This very idea may well
bother us that the Nathan child’s identity seems to be stolen by such a
process. These questions arise out of a worldview that is quite
different than the one in which most of us grew up.</p>
<p>In the end, what this Jesus becomes in this esoteric imagination is a
person whose identity is not founded upon bloodline.<a href="#fn66"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66" role="doc-noteref"><sup>66</sup></a>
Whatever we make of the genealogies and their historical significance,
the human Jesus is no longer merely related to bloodline but to
possibilities that transcend inheritance. It was this that struck the
chord for the adopted person who has no record of his birth, no name for
the mother and father from whom descent may be traced. This finding is
not so very different from the Black Christ.<a href="#fn67"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67" role="doc-noteref"><sup>67</sup></a>
An adopted person, prevented from obtaining his or her history, is
disconnected from the history of blood. In this anthropology of
disconnection, Christology must also image disconnection so that Christ
can save even these. The old humanity was concerned with bloodlines and
inheritance. The new humanity finds something more upon which to base
its identity and prospects.</p>
<h4>VII.Conclusion</h4>
<p>This paper has attempted to take seriously the two genealogies
presented by Matthew and Luke and provide some reasons for thinking that
make sense. In order to do this it accepted a stream of esotericism
developed at the dawn of the twentieth century in central Europe. It
argued from a reincarnational anthropology within a Christian context,
and that human identity is not determined by bloodline. This paper
implicitly argued that an imaginative entrance into the world of the New
Testament should be done with deliberate effort at forming a coherent
worldview. Further, in order to do this sort of work, one must engage
one’s fundamental anthropology without losing track of the need to
remain in coherent conversation with present interests. Finally, it
argues that a transcultural Christology is plausible from an esoteric
perspective.</p>
<p>The question of ongoing revelation through the Akashic record, or
anything else, is unapproached. The attraction of such a thought to an
adopted person whose history has been denied by various interested and
non-interested parties is that important knowledge is not in principle
shut-out for lack of empirical records. Science, in restricting itself
to empirical data, leaves people on their own as they situate themselves
in this existence. On the other hand, theology presupposes that
revelation is necessary to so orientate humanity in existence, and uses
scripture to that end. Theology does not address where revelation that
is already given may be insufficient for the purposes of human inquiry.
This is not saying that scripture is insufficient for salvation,
sufficiency is granted, but there is no reason that humanity should
presuppose that there are no further questions that may be asked of God
or any other spiritual being.</p>
<p>In the course of the paper, reincarnation appeared part of the
worldview in which Zoroaster passed through many incarnations on his way
to Jesus. Reincarnation was held by some in Palestine in the period in
which Jesus lived. Likewise, Buddha’s back story involves numerous
incarnations as well. It would be of value to understand exactly why
reincarnation was lost sight of in the west.</p>
<p>The worldview that Borg discusses, the modern one which he sees
coincident with the Enlightenment and the birth of modern science, may
actually be an evolution of the old view.   That the religious world has
been separating from the secular world for millennia, was part of the
Zoroastrian insight. Today’s questions of human identity are related to
matter (genetics, nature) and to culture (nurture). What does not come
from either nature or nurture in respect of human identity but arises
within a human embodied life needs further examination.</p>
<p>Adopted persons and persons born using assisted reproductive
technology have no choice in the policies which society sets for them.
The anthropology we establish, which will relate to the Christology we
proclaim, will arise from the methods we use in deciding important
things about who we are. Traditional scientific methods will not get us
far in terms of human identity. Theology must be more explicit with
respect to transcultural anthropology. Both science and theology will
need to adjust in response to changing anthropology.</p>
<p>In respect of cosmic evolution, what humanity allows itself to think
about will have direct bearing upon the future of the earth and its
inhabitants. A sense of compassion for others including nature, and what
is at stake if a significant change is not made, may help fire up the
courage to think differently. Thinking differently should, however,
always be surprising and challenging, since it has not been thought
before.</p>
<p>Finally, Jesus Christ must be explicated ever more concretely, as
Rahner says. In this movement from abstraction to concrete there is a
sort of hope that meaning can bring. It is there, in meaning, that human
beings are refreshed.</p>

	<p><strong>Mark Diebel</strong> was introduced to the work of Rudolf Steiner by reading
Owen Barfield’s “Saving the Appearances: A Study in Idolatry” during his
undergraduate studies of Chemistry. In his late twenties he pursued a
vocation to the priesthood in the Episcopal Church. During seminary
years he began reading Anthroposophic literature. He wrote several
essays on Anthroposophy, one of which was sent to Owen Barfield. He has
been a parish priest for twenty-six years, mostly in the mid-Hudson
region of New York, an area known for many anthroposophical endeavors.
He is currently working on a Doctor of Ministry degree at Barry
University in Miami Shores, Florida. His thesis project through the
Department of Theology and Philosophy concerns the life and experiences
of donor conceived adults. Mark is a mixed-race adopted person. He is
married to Beth and they have two grown boys. This paper was written for
a Christology course at Barry University in August 2009.</p>
