## by *Billie Holiday*

I love my man\
I\'m a liar if I say I don\'t\
I love my man\
I\'m a liar if I say I don\'t\
But I\'ll quit my man\
I\'m a liar if I say I won\'t.

I\'ve been your slave, baby\
Ever since I\'ve been your babe\
I\'ve been your slave\
Ever since I\'ve been your babe\
But before I\'ll be your dog\
I\'ll see you in your grave.

My man wouldn\'t give me no breakfast\
Wouldn\'t give me no dinner\
Squawked about my supper then he put me outdoors\
Had the nerve to lay a matchbox on my clothes\
I didn\'t have so many\
But I had a long, long ways to go.

I ain\'t good looking\
And my hair ain\'t curled\
I ain\'t good looking\
And my hair ain\'t curled\
But my mother, she gave me something\
It\'s going to carry me through this world.

Some men like me \'cause I\'m happy\
Some \'cause I\'m snappy\
Some call me honey\
Others think I\'ve got money

Some say me Billie\
Baby, you\'re built for speed\
Now, if you put that all together\
Makes me everything a good man needs.

***Billie Holiday*** (born Elinore Harris; April 7, 1915 July 17, 1959)
was an American jazz singer and songwriter. Nicknamed *Lady Day* by her
friend and musical partner Lester Young, Holiday was a seminal influence
on jazz and pop singing. Her vocal style, strongly inspired by jazz
instrumentalists, pioneered a new way of manipulating phrasing and
tempo. Above all, she was admired all over the world for her deeply
personal and intimate approach to singing. Critic John Bush wrote that
she \"changed the art of American pop vocals forever.\" \"Billie\'s
Blues\" also known as \"I Love My Man\" was one of only a handful of
songs that Ms. Holiday co-wrote. This single was originally recorded in
session in 1936 and featured her orchestra: Bunny Berigan (trumpet);
Artie Shaw (clarinet); Joe Bushkin (piano); Dick McDonough (guitar);
Arthur \"Pete\" Peterson (bass) and Cozy Cole (drums).
