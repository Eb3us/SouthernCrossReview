# Reincarnation Blues

![](reincarnation-1.webp){class="alarge"}

Twas a distant dance ago\
Realer than a writer\'s rhyme\
Longer than you\'ll ever know\
Little to do with what\'s called time.

You think there\'s nothing at all to lose.\
You better think again, baby,\
And heed the Reincarnation Blues:\
That death\'s a-dawning and that ain\'t maybe.

If a century or two is time at all\
Then dream of it before you go\
Then dance to it spring and fall\
For when you go you\'ll never know.

You think there\'s nothing at all to lose.\
You better think again, baby,\
And heed the Reincarnation Blues:\
That death\'s a-dawning and that ain\'t maybe.

It all depends on certain stuff\
You did or didn\'t do this time\
Being good is not enough\
Since they\'ve parsed the perfect rhyme.

You think there\'s nothing at all to lose.\
You better think again, baby,\
And heed the Reincarnation Blues:\
That death\'s a-dawning and that ain\'t maybe.
