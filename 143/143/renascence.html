	<div>
<p class="intropoem">All I could see from where I stood<br />
Was three long mountains and a wood;<br />
I turned and looked another way,<br />
And saw three islands in a bay.<br />
So with my eyes I traced the line<br />
Of the horizon, thin and fine,<br />
Straight around till I was come<br />
Back to where I'd started from;<br />
And all I saw from where I stood<br />
Was three long mountains and a wood.</p>
<p>Over these things I could not see;<br />
These were the things that bounded me;<br />
And I could touch them with my hand,<br />
Almost, I thought, from where I stand.<br />
And all at once things seemed so small<br />
My breath came short, and scarce at all.</p>

<p>But, sure, the sky is big, I said;<br />
Miles and miles above my head;<br />
So here upon my back I'll lie<br />
And look my fill into the sky.<br />
And so I looked, and, after all,<br />
The sky was not so very tall.<br />
The sky, I said, must somewhere stop,<br />
And—sure enough!—I see the top!<br />
The sky, I thought, is not so grand;<br />
I 'most could touch it with my hand!<br />
And reaching up my hand to try,<br /> 
I screamed to feel it touch the sky.</p>

<p>I screamed, and—lo!—Infinity<br />
Came down and settled over me;<br />
Forced back my scream into my chest,<br />
Bent back my arm upon my breast,<br />
And, pressing of the Undefined<br />
The definition on my mind,<br />
Held up before my eyes a glass<br />
Through which my shrinking sight did pass<br />
Until it seemed I must behold<br />
Immensity made manifold;<br />
Whispered to me a word whose sound<br />
Deafened the air for worlds around,<br />
And brought unmuffled to my ears<br />
The gossiping of friendly spheres,<br />
The creaking of the tented sky,<br />
The ticking of Eternity.</p>

<p>I saw and heard, and knew at last<br />
The How and Why of all things, past,<br />
And present, and forevermore.<br />
The Universe, cleft to the core,<br />
Lay open to my probing sense<br />
That, sick'ning, I would fain pluck thence<br />
But could not,—nay! But needs must suck<br />
At the great wound, and could not pluck<br />
My lips away till I had drawn<br />
All venom out.—Ah, fearful pawn!<br />
For my omniscience paid I toll<br />
In infinite remorse of soul.</p>

<p>All sin was of my sinning, all<br />
Atoning mine, and mine the gall<br />
Of all regret. Mine was the weight<br />
Of every brooded wrong, the hate<br />
That stood behind each envious thrust,<br />
Mine every greed, mine every lust.</p>

<p>And all the while for every grief,<br />
Each suffering, I craved relief<br />
With individual desire,—<br />
Craved all in vain! And felt fierce fire<br />
About a thousand people crawl;<br />
Perished with each,—then mourned for all!</p>

<p>A man was starving in Capri;<br />
He moved his eyes and looked at me;<br />
I felt his gaze, I heard his moan,<br />
And knew his hunger as my own.<br />
I saw at sea a great fog bank<br />
Between two ships that struck and sank;<br />
A thousand screams the heavens smote;<br />
And every scream tore through my throat.</p>

<p>No hurt I did not feel, no death<br />
That was not mine; mine each last breath<br />
That, crying, met an answering cry<br />
From the compassion that was I.<br />
All suffering mine, and mine its rod;<br />
Mine, pity like the pity of God.</p>

<p>Ah, awful weight! Infinity<br />
Pressed down upon the finite Me!<br />
My anguished spirit, like a bird,<br />
Beating against my lips I heard;<br />
Yet lay the weight so close about<br />
There was no room for it without.<br />
And so beneath the weight lay I<br />
And suffered death, but could not die.</p>

<p>Long had I lain thus, craving death,<br />
When quietly the earth beneath<br />
Gave way, and inch by inch, so great<br />
At last had grown the crushing weight,<br />
Into the earth I sank till I<br />
Full six feet under ground did lie,<br />
And sank no more,—there is no weight<br />
Can follow here, however great.<br />
From off my breast I felt it roll,<br />
And as it went my tortured soul<br />
Burst forth and fled in such a gust<br />
That all about me swirled the dust.</p>

<p>Deep in the earth I rested now;<br />
Cool is its hand upon the brow<br />
And soft its breast beneath the head<br />
Of one who is so gladly dead.<br />
And all at once, and over all<br />
The pitying rain began to fall;<br />
I lay and heard each pattering hoof<br />
Upon my lowly, thatched roof,<br />
And seemed to love the sound far more<br />
Than ever I had done before.<br />
For rain it hath a friendly sound<br />
To one who's six feet underground;<br />
And scarce the friendly voice or face:<br />
A grave is such a quiet place.</p>

<p>The rain, I said, is kind to come<br />
And speak to me in my new home.<br />
I would I were alive again<br />
To kiss the fingers of the rain,<br />
To drink into my eyes the shine<br />
Of every slanting silver line,<br />
To catch the freshened, fragrant breeze<br />
From drenched and dripping apple-trees.<br />
For soon the shower will be done,<br />
And then the broad face of the sun<br />
Will laugh above the rain-soaked earth<br />
Until the world with answering mirth<br />
Shakes joyously, and each round drop<br />
Rolls, twinkling, from its grass-blade top.</p>

<p>How can I bear it; buried here,<br />
While overhead the sky grows clear<br />
And blue again after the storm?<br />
O, multi-colored, multiform,<br />
Beloved beauty over me,<br />
That I shall never, never see<br />
Again! Spring-silver, autumn-gold,<br />
That I shall never more behold!<br />
Sleeping your myriad magics through,<br />
Close-sepulchred away from you!<br />
O God, I cried, give me new birth,<br />
And put me back upon the earth!<br />
Upset each cloud's gigantic gourd<br />
And let the heavy rain, down-poured<br />
In one big torrent, set me free,<br />
Washing my grave away from me!</p>

<p>I ceased; and through the breathless hush<br />
That answered me, the far-off rush<br />
Of herald wings came whispering<br />
Like music down the vibrant string<br />
Of my ascending prayer, and—crash!<br />
Before the wild wind's whistling lash<br />
The startled storm-clouds reared on high<br />
And plunged in terror down the sky,<br />
And the big rain in one black wave<br />
Fell from the sky and struck my grave.</p>

<p>I know not how such things can be;<br />
I only know there came to me<br />
A fragrance such as never clings<br />
To aught save happy living things;<br />
A sound as of some joyous elf<br />
Singing sweet songs to please himself,<br />
And, through and over everything,<br />
A sense of glad awakening.<br />
The grass, a-tiptoe at my ear,<br />
Whispering to me I could hear;<br />
I felt the rain's cool finger-tips<br />
Brushed tenderly across my lips,<br />
Laid gently on my sealed sight,<br />
And all at once the heavy night<br />
Fell from my eyes and I could see,—<br />
A drenched and dripping apple-tree,<br />
A last long line of silver rain,<br />
A sky grown clear and blue again.<br />
And as I looked a quickening gust<br />
Of wind blew up to me and thrust<br />
Into my face a miracle<br />
Of orchard-breath, and with the smell,—<br />
I know not how such things can be!—<br />
I breathed my soul back into me.</p>

<p>Ah! Up then from the ground sprang I<br />
And hailed the earth with such a cry<br />
As is not heard save from a man<br />
Who has been dead, and lives again.<br />
About the trees my arms I wound;</p>

<p>Like one gone mad I hugged the ground;<br />
I raised my quivering arms on high;<br />
I laughed and laughed into the sky,<br />
Till at my throat a strangling sob<br />
Caught fiercely, and a great heart-throb<br />
Sent instant tears into my eyes;<br />
O God, I cried, no dark disguise<br />
Can e'er hereafter hide from me<br />
Thy radiant identity!</p>

<p>Thou canst not move across the grass<br />
But my quick eyes will see Thee pass,<br />
Nor speak, however silently,<br />
But my hushed voice will answer Thee.<br />
I know the path that tells Thy way<br />
Through the cool eve of every day;<br />
God, I can push the grass apart<br />
And lay my finger on Thy heart!</p>

<p>The world stands out on either side<br />
No wider than the heart is wide;<br />
Above the world is stretched the sky,—<br />
No higher than the soul is high.<br />
The heart can push the sea and land<br />
Farther away on either hand;<br />
The soul can split the sky in two,<br />
And let the face of God shine through.<br />
But East and West will pinch the heart<br />
That can not keep them pushed apart;<br />
And he whose soul is flat—the sky<br />
Will cave in on him by and by.</p>

<p><strong>Edna St. Vincent Millay</strong> (February 22, 1892 – October 19, 1950) was an American <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyric_poetry">lyrical poet</a> and playwright. Her career as a poet was meteoric. In 1923 she became the first woman to win the Pulitzer prize in poetry. (She wrote <em>Renascence</em> when she was only 22.) She became a performance artist super-star, reading her poetry to rapt audiences across the country.</p>
<p>A road accident in middle-age left her a partial invalid and morphine-dependent for years. Yet near the end of her life, she wrote some of her greatest poetry.</p>
