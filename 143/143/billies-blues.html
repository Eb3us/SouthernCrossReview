I'm a liar if I say I don't<br />
I love my man<br />
I'm a liar if I say I don't<br />
But I'll quit my man<br />
I'm a liar if I say I won't.</p>
<p>I've been your slave, baby<br />
Ever since I've been your babe<br />
I've been your slave<br />
Ever since I've been your babe<br />
But before I'll be your dog<br />
I'll see you in your grave.</p>
<p>My man wouldn't give me no breakfast<br />
Wouldn't give me no dinner<br />
Squawked about my supper then he put me outdoors<br />
Had the nerve to lay a matchbox on my clothes<br />
I didn't have so many<br />
But I had a long, long ways to go.</p>
<p>I ain't good looking<br />
And my hair ain't curled<br />
I ain't good looking<br />
And my hair ain't curled<br />
But my mother, she gave me something<br />
It's going to carry me through this world.</p>
<p>Some men like me 'cause I'm happy<br />
Some 'cause I'm snappy<br />
Some call me honey<br />
Others think I've got money</p>
<p>Some say me Billie<br />
Baby, you're built for speed<br />
Now, if you put that all together<br />
Makes me everything a good man needs.</p>

<p><strong><em>Billie Holiday</em></strong> (born Elinore Harris; April
7, 1915 July 17, 1959) was an American jazz singer and songwriter.
Nicknamed <em>Lady Day</em> by her friend and musical partner Lester
Young, Holiday was a seminal influence on jazz and pop singing. Her
vocal style, strongly inspired by jazz instrumentalists, pioneered a new
way of manipulating phrasing and tempo. Above all, she was admired all
over the world for her deeply personal and intimate approach to singing.
Critic John Bush wrote that she "changed the art of American pop vocals
forever." "Billie's Blues" also known as "I Love My Man" was one of only
a handful of songs that Ms.Â Holiday co-wrote. This single was originally
recorded in session in 1936 and featured her orchestra: Bunny Berigan
(trumpet); Artie Shaw (clarinet); Joe Bushkin (piano); Dick McDonough
(guitar); Arthur "Pete" Peterson (bass) and Cozy Cole (drums).</p>
